1
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:55,619
Um... you have no
actual medical training?

2
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,216
No. I have kids.
Learned a lot right there.

3
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:05,179
I've seen nurses give my son
throat cultures, and what is it?

4
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:08,516
You stick a giant Q-tip
down their throat and wait.

5
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:13,312
You take that dipstick
to see if the white count's high.

6
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,022
- Yes, I understand.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,857
I'm great with people.

8
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:21,028
You'd have to observe me
to know for sure. Trust me on that.

9
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,991
I'm a fast learner.
Show me in a lab once...

10
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,284
...and I've got it down.

11
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:31,872
I always wanted to go
to medical school.

12
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:35,042
That was my first interest.
Then I got married...

13
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:37,878
...and had a kid too young
and blew that.

14
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:40,631
Out of high school, I got a job...

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,551
...with Fleuer Engineers in Irvine.

16
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,846
I fell madly in love with geology.

17
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:49,807
- Geology?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:52,101
I learned how to read maps.

19
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:55,229
Yeah. But I lost my job because...

20
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,399
...my boy got chickenpox,
104 temperature.

21
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,736
My ex-husband was useless, so...

22
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:03,779
That didn't really work out.

23
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,747
You got a really nice office.

24
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,292
Thanks.

25
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:22,590
Look...

26
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:55,706
Oh, fuck!

27
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:06,550
Goddamn it!

28
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,425
Good morning, Mr. Masry.

29
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,552
- Morning, Rosalind.
- How are you?

30
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:53,264
- I'm fine. And you?
- Very well. Thank you for asking.

31
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:57,435
Good morning.

32
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:03,065
How you doing?
Donald.

33
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:04,942
Did you see it last night?

34
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,278
I taped it.
Don't tell me what happens.

35
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:08,821
It was so good.

36
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,198
Your nine o'clock's here already.

37
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:22,501
- Remind me.
- Erin Brockovich.

38
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,796
Car accident.
Not her fault, she says.

39
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,299
She was referred.

40
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,891
- Erin, hi.
- Hi.

41
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:39,977
Ed Masry. Sorry you had to wait.

42
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:41,937
That's okay.

43
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,191
Here, sit. Sit down.

44
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,992
Thank you.

45
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:01,499
I never thought standing
could take it out of you.

46
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,751
Ever since that shithead hit me...

47
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,170
...it's like my body's
put together wrong.

48
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,630
You poor thing.

49
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,801
Did anyone ask if you wanted coffee?

50
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:14,720
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Good.

51
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:19,392
Listen, whoever did this to you
made one hell of a mistake.

52
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:23,771
And you and me, we're gonna
make him pay for it.

53
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:27,608
So, uh...

54
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:30,027
...why don't you
tell me what happened?

55
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,615
I was pulling out real slow,
and out of nowhere...

56
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:39,036
...his Jaguar comes racing around
the corner like a bat out of hell.

57
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:43,374
They took some bone from my hip
and put it in my neck.

58
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:45,918
I don't have insurance...

59
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,839
...so I'm about $17,000
in debt right now.

60
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:54,677
I couldn't take painkillers. They made
me too groggy to take care of my kids.

61
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:58,389
Matthew's 8,
and Katie's almost 6.

62
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:00,891
And Beth's just 9 months.

63
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:03,185
I just wanna be a good mom...

64
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,522
...a nice person, a decent citizen.

65
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:09,400
I just wanna take good care
of my kids.

66
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:13,404
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

67
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,200
Seventeen thousand in debt?

68
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,287
Your ex-husband helping?

69
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:22,747
Which one?

70
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,292
There's more than one?

71
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,503
Yeah, there's two. Why?

72
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:38,596
You must have been feeling
desperate that afternoon.

73
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:40,264
What's your point?

74
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:42,933
Broke, three kids, no job.

75
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,270
- Doctor in a Jaguar is a meal ticket...
- Objection.

76
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,022
- Sustained.
- He hit me!

77
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,148
So you say.

78
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:52,193
He came tearing around the corner,
out of control.

79
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:57,448
An ER doctor, who spends his days
saving lives, was out of control?

80
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:01,327
That asshole smashed in
my fucking neck!

81
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,165
Open and fucking shut?!

82
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:09,502
- Exactly the language...
- It was over before that!

83
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,379
I told you he might get personal.

84
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:13,589
- You said I was set.
- I never said that.

85
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,217
You told me I had a good shot!

86
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:20,179
- Let's settle down.
- Fuck "settle down"! I've got $74.

87
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:24,058
- I can't afford to settle down!
- I'm sorry, Erin.

88
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:30,356
Do they teach lawyers to apologize?
Because you suck at it.

89
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:05,599
Hello?

90
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,810
- Hi.
- Hi, Erin.

91
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,396
You're back so soon.

92
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:13,232
Were you a good girl?

93
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:17,069
You're my little baby.
What is that? A little cough?

94
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,404
She's got a cough.

95
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:22,158
I sat in the steam with her
to try to loosen it up.

96
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:25,202
- I think I've got cough medicine.
- <i>Bueno.</i>

97
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:27,705
Listen.

98
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:29,832
I didn't wanna tell you before.

99
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,126
- With your worries.
- What?

100
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:35,921
My daughter bought a big house
with a room for me.

101
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,757
I'm moving in with her.

102
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:39,425
- When?
- Next week.

103
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:43,220
- Next week?
- I know. But it's good for me.

104
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:46,098
Now I can help
take care of my grandkids.

105
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,433
It's good for you.

106
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:50,478
Now with money, you can hire
a good babysitter.

107
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,730
Not the old lady next door.

108
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:54,607
Thanks.

109
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:00,029
Matthew?

110
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:03,366
- Katie, you back here?
- Yeah.

111
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:04,950
Come on in, would ya?

112
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:13,584
- Hey, get in the house. No dripping.
- Okay!

113
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:21,509
Sweetie. Please don't
get sick on me, please.

114
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:31,936
Let's fix dinner.

115
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:35,690
Yes, look.

116
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,780
Look at the water.

117
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:53,624
Goddamn it!

118
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,335
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:02,425
Matthew! Katie! We're going out!

120
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,055
You go ahead and order.

121
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:11,976
I'm gonna have a cheeseburger
deluxe with a Coke.

122
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:18,065
Mommy, can I have a cheeseburger
deluxe with no cheese and no bread?

123
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,110
Did you get that?

124
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:26,699
And she will have a cup of chicken
broth and a few crackers, please.

125
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,493
- And for you?
- Just a cup of coffee.

126
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:31,537
You're not eating?

127
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:36,375
My lawyer took me out to a fancy lunch
to celebrate, and I'm still stuffed.

128
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,336
How about that?

129
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,796
Yes, I'm calling about
the job ad in the paper.

130
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,256
I'm calling about the job ad.

131
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,550
The great personality, good voice.

132
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:29,303
I don't have any actual
sales experience.

133
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:32,932
I don't really have a resume,
but I can...

134
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,434
I don't have any computer skills.

135
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,481
Oh. Well, I thought it was
the local store.

136
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:43,401
Okay. Thanks anyway.

137
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:45,403
Okay, bye.

138
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,743
Ed Masry, please.

139
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:55,037
Yes, I'm holding for Ed Masry.

140
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:56,789
Is he ever in the office?

141
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,458
No, but I've called
about a dozen times.

142
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,335
I'd like to leave a message.

143
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:05,214
Brockovich, B-R-O-C-K-O-V-l-C-H.

144
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:09,010
I'm a client. I want him to call.
It's that simple.

145
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,598
Okay.

146
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:31,699
Goddamn it!

147
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,744
- Brenda! Brenda!
- Yeah?

148
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,079
Who put that there?

149
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,040
The files you asked for.

150
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,710
I didn't ask you to put it
in the middle of the floor.

151
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,713
Get a towel, will you?
Hey, hey...

152
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:50,468
- Hey, what's she doing here?
- Who?

153
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,098
Donald.

154
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,685
What's she doing here?

155
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,354
She works here.

156
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,034
Erin.

157
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,370
How's it going?

158
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:20,206
You never called me back.
I left messages.

159
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:24,085
You did? I didn't know that.
Donald seems to think...

160
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,715
Being ignored and being lied to.

161
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,218
- I never lied.
- You said things'd be fine.

162
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:34,220
They're not. I trusted you.

163
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,055
- I'm sorry.
- I don't need pity.

164
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,058
I need a paycheck.
And I've looked.

165
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:43,646
When you spend 6 years raising babies,
it's hard to get a job that pays.

166
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:48,025
Are you getting this down, honey?
Or am I talking too fast for you?

167
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,902
I'm sorry about that.

168
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:52,113
But we have a full staff now...

169
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:57,410
Bullshit. If you had a full staff,
you'd return a client's damn call.

170
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,289
I'm smart and hard-working.
I'm not leaving here without a job.

171
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:17,221
Don't make me beg.

172
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:20,975
If it doesn't work out, fire me.

173
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:23,644
Don't make me beg.

174
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:32,028
No benefits.

175
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:38,284
What we do in here is file
all of the cases.

176
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:42,079
That way, at any time,
we can tell the status of a file.

177
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,790
Where it is in the office and stuff.

178
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,502
Here's where we organize
all the files alphabetically.

179
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,588
- Simple enough.
- Okay.

180
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,715
- And here is your desk.
- Okay.

181
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,593
I want to show you where
the X erox machine is.

182
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:58,012
Everybody has a code.

183
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,765
- Do I get to pick my own code?
- We'll see.

184
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:11,567
Can you tell me who I talk to about
getting an advance on my paycheck?

185
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,736
Just for the weekend.

186
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:16,280
Rosalind's the office manager.

187
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,492
She handles the payroll
and petty cash.

188
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,910
She's gone already.

189
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,163
She leaves early on Fridays.

190
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,544
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, for Pete's sake, here.

191
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,133
I've only got hundreds.

192
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:43,599
I don't want your money, Mr. Masry.

193
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,520
Where do you think
your paycheck comes from?

194
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,231
- Have a good weekend.
- Thank you.

195
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,942
- See you.
- All right, see you.

196
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,903
See you Monday.

197
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,960
Hi, my sweetie. Hello.

198
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,253
How are you?

199
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:13,963
Matthew, Katie.

200
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,298
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

201
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,260
How are you?

202
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,929
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

203
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,381
Hey!

204
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,135
Hey!

205
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,558
Hello.

206
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,562
What are you doing
making all that goddamn noise?

207
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:15,358
Introducing ourselves
to the neighbourhood, I guess.

208
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,653
Well, I am the neighbours. There.

209
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,905
We're introduced.
So shut up.

210
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:27,203
Wait. Hold on there.
Let's start over, okay?

211
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,121
My name's George.
What's yours?

212
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:33,876
Just think of me as the person
next door who likes it quiet.

213
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,544
Don't be like that.

214
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,255
Look, we live next door.
I feel bad.

215
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:41,258
I'm sorry.
Will you accept my apology?

216
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:45,137
We're living right next door.
If you need a cup of a sugar...

217
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:47,640
- I don't need sugar.
- You don't.

218
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,768
Why don't I take you
out to dinner to apologize?

219
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,521
Give me your number.
I got your address...

220
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:55,815
...so you can't get away.

221
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:58,401
I'll call you up proper
and ask you out.

222
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,237
You want my number?

223
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,614
I do. I do want your number.

224
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:07,994
Which number do you want, George?

225
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,122
I like the way you say that.

226
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:12,957
How many numbers you got?

227
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:16,669
I got numbers coming out
of my ears. For instance, 10.

228
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,421
- Ten.
- Yeah.

229
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:21,424
That's how many months old
my baby girl is.

230
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:23,759
- You got a little girl?
- Yeah.

231
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,470
Sexy, huh? How about this? Six.

232
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:29,765
That's my other daughter.
Eight is my son.

233
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:32,768
Two is the times
I've been married and divorced.

234
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,187
$16 is what I have
in my bank account.

235
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:38,441
850-3943, that's my phone number.

236
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:43,237
I'm guessing zero is the number
of times you're gonna call it.

237
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,866
Hey, how do you remember
your bank balance?

238
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,951
See, that impresses me.

239
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:51,662
You're dead wrong about that zero.

240
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:02,715
How long has she been crying?

241
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,719
She's got that tooth coming in.

242
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:11,223
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on.
I'll check back later.

243
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:12,308
Where's Anna?

244
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:15,227
She's out to lunch with the girls.

245
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,232
I have to open a file.

246
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,694
Real-estate thing, pro bono.

247
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,905
- Okay.
- Know how to do that?

248
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:28,616
Yeah, I got it. No problem.

249
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,204
You're a girl.

250
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,290
Excuse me?

251
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,127
Why aren't you out to lunch
with the girls? You're a girl.

252
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:44,215
I guess I'm not the right kind.

253
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:54,642
Look, you may want to...
Now that you're working here...

254
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:58,813
You may want to rethink
your wardrobe a little.

255
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,357
Why is that?

256
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:06,946
Well, I think some of the girls
are a little uncomfortable...

257
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,573
...because of what you wear.

258
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:13,202
Is that so?

259
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:17,623
Well, it just so happens,
I think I look nice.

260
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:21,168
As long as I have one ass
instead of two, I'll wear what I like...

261
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,129
...if that's all right with you?

262
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:34,056
You might wanna rethink those ties.

263
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:53,701
With real-estate stuff, could you
remind me? I'm a little confused.

264
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:58,497
Why are there medical records
and blood samples in real-estate files?

265
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,333
You've been here long enough.

266
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:05,004
If you don't know how to do your job
by now, I'm not gonna do it for you.

267
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,064
Hello?

268
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,569
Hello?

269
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:32,657
Matthew? Katie?

270
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:53,177
Matthew? Katie?

271
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,976
Matthew!

272
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:21,455
What happened?

273
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:24,208
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey. Hungry?

274
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,543
Am I...?

275
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,754
They're here?
I went to pick them up.

276
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,758
She came by an hour ago. Something
came up, she dropped them off.

277
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,385
Something came up?

278
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:35,678
Why didn't she call?

279
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:40,057
I don't know. She, I was, she...
I don't know why.

280
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:43,060
- That stupid bitch.
- Mom!

281
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,064
I just can't believe she dumps
my kids off when nobody's home.

282
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:48,983
I was home.

283
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,320
We're fine. We cooked
burgers, had some milk.

284
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:55,031
You want a hot dog? There's one.

285
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:58,701
- Or a cheeseburger?
- But this mustard is slippery.

286
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:03,497
Mom, what do you think
about me getting a tattoo?

287
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,666
One, two, three.

288
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:13,174
I got all these kings.
You win, you got a joker.

289
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,134
King.

290
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,802
Joker.

291
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:20,056
You stole a joker!

292
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:21,349
You cheat.

293
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:22,975
What do you mean?

294
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:27,855
You cheat!
Get another one.

295
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,857
Time to go to bed.

296
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:33,277
Get ready for bed.
Brush your teeth.

297
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,739
- Play tomorrow?
- Yeah.

298
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,161
Good night, buddy.

299
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,829
What's that?

300
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,249
This is a Harley-Davidson,
the best motorcycle ever.

301
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,379
And if I ever catch either one of you
near one, knock you silly.

302
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,303
Brush. And keep it down,
the baby's asleep.

303
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:01,972
You got great kids.

304
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,977
Well, I'm sure
I'll fuck 'em up eventually.

305
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:08,646
Why?

306
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:13,442
I'm not a good judge of character,
or I wouldn't have left them...

307
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:17,530
...with that idiot, who cost a lot
and smelled like chicken fat.

308
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,116
And after I find her and kill her...

309
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,827
...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

310
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:25,538
If you need help with them,
I could do that.

311
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:29,709
- I'm not leaving my kids with you.
- Why?

312
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:33,671
- I don't even know you.
- What do you wanna know?

313
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:36,799
- Thanks for today...
- You're welcome.

314
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,676
It was my pleasure.

315
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:41,929
How many decks did you have?

316
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,515
We had more than enough.

317
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:47,101
Got so many friends
you can't use one more?

318
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:53,232
If you need someone to look after your
kids after school, or whatever...

319
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,401
...I don't have a job now.

320
00:24:56,652 --> 00:25:00,364
" I'm unemployed."

321
00:25:00,614 --> 00:25:01,657
By choice.

322
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:03,659
I work when I need to.

323
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,371
What do you do?
Live off your trust fund?

324
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:12,084
I do construction, which pays good,
and I make it last by living cheap.

325
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,003
Is that supposed to impress me?

326
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:15,838
Hey. Bed.

327
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:18,090
Your little ghosts.

328
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:22,887
You always this hard on people
who try to help you?

329
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:24,805
I'm out of practice.

330
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,767
Well, let me remind you then.

331
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:31,854
The polite thing is to say thank you.
I'd start it off with that.

332
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,024
Then, " Hey, that's
a really nice offer.

333
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,693
I don't mind taking you up on that."

334
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,029
Why do you want to watch my kids?

335
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,447
- I like kids.
- Right.

336
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:44,450
I like hanging out with them.
They keep it simple.

337
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:48,788
You're home every afternoon?

338
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:51,082
I'm usually working on my bike.

339
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:59,757
If it doesn't work out, you can always
send them back to the chicken-fat lady.

340
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:07,974
This isn't gonna get you laid.

341
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:11,477
Get in bed.

342
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:14,814
Good, because I don't
find you attractive either.

343
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,482
Then we're even.

344
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,443
I'm so glad we got that
out of the way.

345
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:20,820
I feel much better.

346
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,407
I do too. Because now I can
just look after the kids...

347
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:27,618
...and I don't have to worry
about you coming on to me.

348
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:29,889
Bring the phone into the changing room.
Of course they won't.

349
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:34,685
Mrs. Masry, don't be such a tease.
Hold on, just hold on. Yeah?

350
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:37,647
Sorry, would you mind
if I investigate this?

351
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:39,148
Investigate what?

352
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,526
This real-estate thing
with the Jensens. The pro bono.

353
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:47,198
I wanna make sure I understand
what I'm reading.

354
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:50,743
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- You don't mind?

355
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:53,454
Okay, great. Thanks.

356
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:04,525
Donna Jensen?

357
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:08,571
I'm Erin Brockovich,
with Masry and Vititoe.

358
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:11,240
Oh! You're a lawyer?

359
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,827
Hell, no. I hate lawyers.
I just work for 'em.

360
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:16,579
Do you have a minute?

361
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:21,459
I don't mean to be a pain to PG&E
after all they've done for Hinkley...

362
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:27,757
...but if they want this place,
they're gonna have to pay for it.

363
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:31,927
You didn't put the house up for sale.
They just wanted to buy it?

364
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:34,013
Oh, yeah, yeah.

365
00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:37,433
Oh, I don't wanna move.
Uproot the kids?

366
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:39,769
I've got a couple of girls.

367
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,189
Honest to God, I don't know
if I have the energy.

368
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:47,443
You know, I've been sick.
Me and Pete both have.

369
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:52,239
The idea of selling, if they're
not gonna pay us properly...

370
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:53,949
...I don't see the point.

371
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,745
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

372
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:00,915
I guess the only thing
that confused me...

373
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:05,378
Not that your medical problems
aren't important.

374
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:09,048
How come those files are in
with all the real-estate stuff?

375
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:14,136
There's just so much correspondence,
I just keep it all in one place.

376
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:23,896
I'm sorry, I just don't see why you're
corresponding with PG&E...

377
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,983
...about your medical problems
in the first place.

378
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:30,152
Well, they paid
for the doctor's visit.

379
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:31,946
They did?

380
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:35,616
You bet. Paid for a checkup
for the whole family.

381
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:40,955
Not like with insurance, where you pay
and maybe you see some money in a year.

382
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:43,833
They just took care of it.
Just like that.

383
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,418
We never saw a bill.

384
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,503
Wow. Why'd they do that?

385
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,338
The chromium.

386
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,632
- The what?
- The chromium.

387
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:55,094
Well, that's what
kicked this whole thing off.

388
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:38,054
- What kind of chromium?
- There's more than one?

389
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:42,058
There's straight-up chromium,
it does good things for the body.

390
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:44,852
There's chrom three,
which is fairly benign.

391
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:47,438
There's chrom six,
hexavalent chromium...

392
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:50,691
...which, depending on the amounts,
can be harmful.

393
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:53,653
Harmful how? What would you get?

394
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:57,239
With repeated exposure
to toxic levels, anything...

395
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,952
...from chronic headaches to respiratory
disease, liver failure...

396
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:05,998
...heart failure, reproductive failure,
bone or organ deterioration.

397
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:08,501
Plus, of course, any type of cancer.

398
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,629
So that stuff, it kills people.

399
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:13,214
Yeah, definitely.

400
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,299
Highly toxic. Highly carcinogenic.

401
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,762
It gets into your DNA, so you pass
the trouble to your kids. Very bad.

402
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,847
Well, what's it used for?

403
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,307
A rust inhibitor.

404
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:28,688
The utility plants use piston engines
that get hot, they run water through.

405
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,856
Chromium's in the water
to prevent corrosion.

406
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:35,236
How do I find out what kind
of chromium they use in Hinkley?

407
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,822
- Been to their water board?
- What's that?

408
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:39,156
Every county has one.

409
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:42,076
They keep records of anything
in their jurisdiction.

410
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:45,413
- You should find something there.
- County water board.

411
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,791
- Alrighty. Well, thanks.
- Good luck.

412
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,545
I wouldn't advertise
what you're looking for.

413
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:57,091
Incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble.

414
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:00,636
I'll remember that. Thanks.

415
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:13,607
<i>This guy's too smart.</i>

416
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,320
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>
<i>until he makes his move.</i>

417
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,239
<i>He positions women employees</i>
<i>in such a way...</i>

418
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:24,994
<i>... that they have no choice</i>
<i>but to respond or lose their jobs...</i>

419
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,794
- That's a heavy door.
- Let me give you a hand.

420
00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:37,965
Thank you very much. Aren't you
a gentleman, Mr?

421
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:40,718
- Scott.
- Mr. Scott.

422
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:44,430
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Erin.

423
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,390
Erin. Erin. Cool.

424
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,310
What can I do for you, Erin?

425
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:53,856
Believe it or not, I'm on the prowl
for some water records.

426
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:55,733
You come to the right place.

427
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:57,652
I guess I did.

428
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:02,573
Just tell me what you wanna look at,
and I'd be glad to dig 'em out.

429
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:06,786
I wish I knew. It's for my boss.
He's in this water dispute...

430
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:12,041
...and he wants me to find all kinds
of papers, from all kinds of places.

431
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,507
You know,
it would probably be easiest...

432
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,718
...if I squeezed back there
and poked around myself.

433
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:26,180
- Would that be all right with you?
- Come on back.

434
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,976
- I'm gonna need you to sign in here.
- Oh, sure.

435
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:38,651
- " Pattee," is that your middle name?
- No, maiden.

436
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,236
Oh, you're married?

437
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,030
Not anymore.

438
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:47,368
- Can I just?
- Yeah.

439
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:49,412
I love your pants.

440
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:53,040
Oh, well, yeah, thanks.

441
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:54,959
Well, this is it.

442
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:57,920
It's impressive.

443
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:02,258
I'll call you if I need anything.

444
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,595
- All right.
- Okay.

445
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:08,222
- Thank you.
- Okay.

446
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,349
Where's my stuff?

447
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:35,434
Where have you been?

448
00:36:35,685 --> 00:36:37,228
Where the fuck is my stuff?

449
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,398
Don't you use language
like that with...

450
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:43,192
Someone took my stuff.

451
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:46,112
- Nice to see you.
- I had photos of my kids...

452
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:49,865
Toothbrush, toothpaste,
mousse and deodorant.

453
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,284
What's going on?

454
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:56,622
This isn't a job where you
can disappear for days at a time.

455
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:59,417
You don't do the work,
you don't get to stay.

456
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:02,461
All I've been doing is working.
Ask Mr. Masry.

457
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,715
You ask Mr. Masry. He fired you.

458
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,511
You said to fire me?

459
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,389
I'll call you back.
You've been gone for a week.

460
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:17,351
I left a message. I was gonna
write a whole damn report.

461
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:21,105
That's not how we work. You don't
leave a message and take off.

462
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:24,692
- Want me to check in every second?
- It's called accountability.

463
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,153
I'm not talking to you, bitch!

464
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:28,362
That's enough!

465
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:33,034
Look, Erin, this incident aside,
I don't think this is the right...

466
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:34,660
...place for you.

467
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,622
So I'm gonna make a few calls,
find you something else.

468
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:39,749
Don't bother.

469
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,250
I'm trying to help.

470
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,004
You're trying not to feel guilty
about firing someone with 3 kids.

471
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,590
Fuck if I'm gonna help you do that.

472
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:51,969
Get back to work!

473
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:14,283
What the hell are you doing here?

474
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,661
I'm fixing the leak.

475
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:20,122
Damn it, I don't ask you
to do things like that.

476
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:23,501
Look at this mess that you've made.

477
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,796
- I'm not done with that yet.
- Well, get it out.

478
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:30,174
- Relax.
- Shit! Where did it go?

479
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,009
Where is it?

480
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:33,260
Back there.

481
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,595
Behind your foot.

482
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:36,931
- Going up your leg now.
- Jesus!

483
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,684
Who fucking lives like this, George?

484
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:45,064
Who lets their kids run around in a
place with bugs the size of house cats?

485
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:48,401
All you have to do
is call an exterminator.

486
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:51,153
I can't call an exterminator.

487
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,949
I can't afford one.
I can't even afford my phone.

488
00:38:58,327 --> 00:38:59,412
I got fired.

489
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:01,205
What?

490
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,793
What do you mean, you got fired?
You're working so hard.

491
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:07,878
Doesn't matter.

492
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:14,135
Doesn't make one fucking bit
of difference.

493
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,110
I don't know what happened to me.

494
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,866
I mean...

495
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:41,871
God, I was Miss Wichita,
for chrissake.

496
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,207
Did I tell you that?

497
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:52,923
You are living next door to a real,
live fucking beauty queen.

498
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,640
I still have my tiara.

499
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:08,314
And I thought it meant I was gonna
do something important with my life.

500
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,566
That it meant I was someone.

501
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,617
You're someone to me.

502
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,172
Are you gonna be something else
that I have to survive?

503
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:36,926
Because I'll tell you the truth...

504
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:41,097
...l'm not up to it.

505
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:25,933
I get up in the centre of the stage...

506
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,644
...and I have the big
bouquet of flowers.

507
00:41:28,894 --> 00:41:31,480
I had my foot out like this,

508
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:35,359
" I will devote my entire reign
as Miss Wichita...

509
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:38,070
...to bringing an end to world hunger.

510
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:41,365
And to the creation
of a peaceful earth...

511
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:44,201
...for every man, woman and child."

512
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:48,414
- How long were you Miss Wichita?
- One year.

513
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:51,792
By the time I got through
opening new supermarkets...

514
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:55,588
...I only had a few weeks left
to work on hunger...

515
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:57,840
...and world peace.
- World peace.

516
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,509
I don't know what I was thinking.

517
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,679
What about you, huh?

518
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:05,556
What about me?

519
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,898
Let me tell you something.

520
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,400
Let me get that out of your hair.

521
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:20,363
- Thank you.
- Nice.

522
00:42:26,786 --> 00:42:28,913
You're a very special lady.

523
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:36,879
Don't be too nice to me, okay?

524
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:38,506
Why?

525
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,217
Makes me nervous.

526
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,649
It's some slim pickings here, baby.

527
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,155
Maybe that's Ed McMahon.
Let's go see.

528
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:10,913
Wrong Ed.

529
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,457
What are you doing here?

530
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:17,378
I had an interesting call
this afternoon from Dr. Frankel...

531
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,714
...from UCLA.
- Oh, yeah?

532
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:24,302
He wanted you to know that the " legal
limit for hexavalent chromium...

533
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:29,015
...is.05 parts per million...

534
00:43:29,265 --> 00:43:32,852
...and at the rate you mentioned,
.58, it could be...

535
00:43:33,102 --> 00:43:37,648
...responsible for the cancers"
in that family you asked about...

536
00:43:38,024 --> 00:43:39,608
...the Jensens.

537
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:42,778
Well. Wasn't that nice of him?

538
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:47,116
Funny how some people help people,
and others just fire them.

539
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,287
I'm sorry. You were gone.
I assumed you were off having fun.

540
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,207
Why the hell would you assume that?

541
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:58,544
Maybe you look like someone
who has a lot of fun.

542
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:01,589
By that standard,
I assume you never get laid.

543
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,051
I'm married.

544
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:11,682
Look, what is this... What's the story
on this cancer stuff?

545
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:19,023
You wanna know, you have to hire me
back. I got a ton of bills to pay.

546
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:21,942
Fine.

547
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:23,736
Fine.

548
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:28,199
Donna just put in these new cabinets,
stained the wood and all...

549
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:32,161
...when she gets a call from PG&E,
saying a freeway's gonna be built...

550
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,289
...and they wanna buy her house
for an off-ramp.

551
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,000
The husband's sick with Hodgkin's.

552
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,752
She keeps getting tumours...

553
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,838
...believing one has nothing
to do with the other.

554
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:45,341
Because PG&E told her
about the chromium?

555
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:47,301
They had a seminar.

556
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,887
They invited 200 people
from the area...

557
00:44:50,137 --> 00:44:51,889
...had it at the plant...

558
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:55,017
...about chromium three
and how good it is...

559
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:57,436
...when they're using chromium six.

560
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:02,650
That document you found
at the water board...

561
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,862
...the one that says
about the bad chromium...

562
00:45:07,863 --> 00:45:10,491
You didn't happen to make a copy,
did you?

563
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,243
Of course I did.

564
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,412
Could I have a look?

565
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:16,497
I want a raise.

566
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:20,668
And benefits, including dental.

567
00:45:21,877 --> 00:45:23,546
It's not how I do business.

568
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,381
- What way is that?
- Extortion.

569
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,766
A 5% raise, we'll talk
about benefits later.

570
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:41,022
Ten. There are lots of other places
I could get work.

571
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:46,569
10% raise and benefits, but that's it.
I'm drawing the line.

572
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:49,572
He's drawing the line.

573
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:01,709
This the only thing you got?

574
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:05,004
Well, the place is a pigsty.
There's probably more.

575
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:07,506
I know how those things are run.

576
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:11,844
What makes you think
you can just walk in there...

577
00:46:12,094 --> 00:46:15,014
...and find what we need?

578
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,975
They're called boobs, Ed.

579
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,452
Yes, I'm sure it is.

580
00:46:37,703 --> 00:46:38,913
I understand.

581
00:46:40,373 --> 00:46:42,166
I agree. I agree. I'm going to.

582
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,542
Right now.

583
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:52,885
I'm almost done. Look.

584
00:46:53,803 --> 00:46:55,429
How are we doing?

585
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,306
We're doing great.

586
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:00,685
Good.

587
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:04,814
Well, you've got quite a lot
done already. So...

588
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:09,443
Sorry, we need to have
those records back now.

589
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:11,070
No.

590
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,159
These papers are public record.
I'm not leaving...

591
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,871
...until they're copied.

592
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,929
Fax these to this number, okay?

593
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,432
- All of them?
- All of them.

594
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,997
An on-site monitoring well?

595
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,292
- That means it was...
- It's on the PG&E property.

596
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:12,381
And you say that this stuff,
this hexavalent chromium...

597
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,926
- Well, it's poisonous.
- Yeah.

598
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:28,314
It's gotta be different than what's
in our water, because ours is okay.

599
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:31,359
The guys from PG&E told me.

600
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:35,321
They sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine.

601
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:40,743
I know. But the toxicologist
that I've been talking to...

602
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:45,748
...he gave me a list of problems that
come from hexavalent chromium exposure.

603
00:48:45,998 --> 00:48:49,293
Everything you all have
is on that list.

604
00:48:49,502 --> 00:48:52,004
No, no, no.

605
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:58,678
That's not what...
That's not what our doctor said.

606
00:48:58,886 --> 00:49:00,554
He said that...

607
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:05,351
Well, that one's got absolutely
nothing to do with the other.

608
00:49:06,894 --> 00:49:09,522
But PG&E paid for that doctor.

609
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,044
Ashley!

610
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:34,797
Shanna!
Get out of the pool!

611
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:37,591
- How come?
- I said so, that's why.

612
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:46,475
The minute Brenda sent that fax...

613
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:50,813
...l'm saying, the second she
pressed the "send" button...

614
00:49:52,315 --> 00:49:56,444
...PG&E's claim department
was on the phone to me...

615
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,446
...scheduling a meeting.

616
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,948
So you think that...
Let me do it.

617
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,908
You're driving me nuts.

618
00:50:03,117 --> 00:50:04,702
You think we scared them?

619
00:50:04,952 --> 00:50:07,288
Taking the trouble to send someone...

620
00:50:07,496 --> 00:50:10,958
...sounds like they're
sitting up and taking notice.

621
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:27,642
Mr. Foil?

622
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:32,146
In the interest
of putting this to rest...

623
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:36,817
...PG&E is willing to offer
the Jensens $250,000 for their home.

624
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,903
$250,000?

625
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,531
In terms of land value in Hinkley...

626
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,493
...we feel that's a more
than fair price.

627
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,371
How about in terms
of medical expenses?

628
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:53,209
$250,000 isn't gonna come close to what
this family's gonna spend on doctors.

629
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,797
I understand they've had bad luck,
health-wise.

630
00:50:58,047 --> 00:50:59,757
They have my sympathies.

631
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:01,509
But that's not PG&E's fault.

632
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,511
You're kidding, right?

633
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,139
Look at these readings.

634
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:11,227
PG&E's own technicians documented...

635
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:14,480
...toxic levels of hexavalent chromium
in those wells...

636
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,941
...on numerous occasions.

637
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:19,360
Everything the Jensens have had...

638
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:24,657
...is proven reaction to exposure to
hexavalent chromium. They have had...

639
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:27,159
They have had...

640
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:34,458
Breast cysts, uterine cancer,
Hodgkin's, immune deficiencies...

641
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:35,960
...asthma, nosebleeds...

642
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,671
A million things could
cause those problems.

643
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:43,259
Poor diet, bad genes,
irresponsible lifestyle.

644
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,636
Our offer is final
and more than fair.

645
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:49,056
Wait a minute.
I thought we were negotiating here.

646
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:56,230
$250,000 is all
I'm authorized to offer.

647
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:01,152
I'll present your offer to my clients.

648
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:03,446
I doubt they'll accept.

649
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:07,158
Before you go off on a crusade...

650
00:52:07,408 --> 00:52:09,744
...remember who you're dealing with.

651
00:52:09,994 --> 00:52:13,664
PG&E's a 28 billion
dollar corporation.

652
00:52:14,123 --> 00:52:17,043
28 billion dollars?

653
00:52:17,293 --> 00:52:19,503
I didn't know it was that much!

654
00:52:19,712 --> 00:52:24,008
Wow! Twenty-eight billion!

655
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:26,385
Holy cow!

656
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:27,845
They made an offer.

657
00:52:28,095 --> 00:52:31,807
No, a million would have been
an offer. They send that...

658
00:52:32,058 --> 00:52:35,269
...mail clerk down to jerk me off,
waste my time.

659
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:36,312
Why?

660
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,689
You heard what that kid said.

661
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:43,319
They have 28 billion dollars.
They can afford to waste time.

662
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:45,279
- You can't?
- Am I made of money?

663
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,782
- Why are you yelling?
- I'm pissed.

664
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,994
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you back!

665
00:53:02,088 --> 00:53:04,090
I really hate you sometimes.

666
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,842
No. You love me.

667
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:21,023
You've been reading for hours.

668
00:53:21,273 --> 00:53:23,109
I'm a slow reader.

669
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,057
Excuse me.

670
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,018
- Are you Erin Brockovich?
- Yeah.

671
00:53:58,019 --> 00:53:59,645
I'm Tom Robinson.

672
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:01,689
This is my wife, Mandy.

673
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:04,900
We used to live across
the street from the Jensens.

674
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:07,361
I think you know Donna.

675
00:54:08,654 --> 00:54:11,699
PG&E bought our house last year.

676
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:17,163
Well, the vet said they had
a bunch of tumours and stuff.

677
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:21,042
Well, you can see
they couldn't really walk.

678
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:23,419
How many were born like this?

679
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:27,381
Twelve or 13 or so.

680
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:31,719
When Donna told us what
you told her about the chromium...

681
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:35,097
...we figured it might have
something to do with this.

682
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,016
Yeah, it might.

683
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:38,809
Really, may I keep these?

684
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:40,269
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

685
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,648
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

686
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:46,525
There's something else too.

687
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:49,695
What?

688
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:57,078
Mandy, here, has had...

689
00:54:57,286 --> 00:54:59,914
...five miscarriages.

690
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:01,540
I'm so sorry.

691
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,127
I figured it was something I did.

692
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,631
Like, when I smoked marijuana,
maybe...

693
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,258
...or took birth control pills...

694
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:13,928
...but then Donna
said that you thought...

695
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:17,306
...this chromium might be
to blame for her problems.

696
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,517
So I figured maybe...

697
00:55:22,728 --> 00:55:24,146
...it wasn't just me.

698
00:55:41,414 --> 00:55:43,290
I have to take a bath.

699
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,376
You should go in.

700
00:55:47,503 --> 00:55:49,130
They're not asleep?

701
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:54,343
Beth and Katie are.

702
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:13,738
- How was school?
- Fine.

703
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,532
- Did you do your homework?
- Yeah.

704
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,037
Any problems?

705
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:35,593
I know you're upset,
but the way this job is...

706
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:39,889
...things come up at the last minute.
Things that I gotta deal with.

707
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,183
Fine!

708
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:50,024
Please don't be mad at me.

709
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:54,612
I'm doing this for us. I know
it's hard for you to understand...

710
00:56:57,865 --> 00:57:00,618
...but don't you want Mommy
to be good at her job?

711
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:11,504
I don't miss dinner all the time.
We all ate together last night.

712
00:57:11,712 --> 00:57:13,673
You were reading the whole time.

713
00:57:38,197 --> 00:57:42,201
There's something about this thing
I don't understand, Mr. Masry.

714
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,371
If PG&E messed with our water...

715
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:48,499
...why would they say anything
about it to us at all?

716
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,626
Why not just keep quiet about it?

717
00:57:50,918 --> 00:57:52,962
To establish a statute of limitations.

718
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,965
In a case like this,
you only have one year...

719
00:57:56,215 --> 00:57:59,343
...from the time you learn about
the problem to file suit.

720
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:01,804
So PG&E figures...

721
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:06,017
..."We'll let the cat out of the bag.
Tell them the water isn't perfect.

722
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:09,270
If we can ride out the year
with no one suing...

723
00:58:09,478 --> 00:58:11,355
...we'll be in the clear forever."

724
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:14,233
But they told us more than a year ago.

725
00:58:14,442 --> 00:58:16,986
- That's okay. We're not suing.
- Not yet.

726
00:58:17,486 --> 00:58:20,323
All we're doing
is using this information...

727
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,284
...to get you a nice purchase
price on your house.

728
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:28,080
And you two, a comparable
retroactive bonus on your sale price.

729
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:30,958
PG&E still looks good
to their shareholders.

730
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:32,918
They're not in a lawsuit.

731
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:35,546
All they're doing is buying property.

732
00:58:37,673 --> 00:58:40,509
Doesn't say how much
this thing's gonna cost us.

733
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:44,639
My fee is 40% of whatever
you get awarded.

734
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:56,817
Boy, do I know how you feel.

735
00:58:57,026 --> 00:59:00,780
The first time I heard that number,
I said, "You're kidding me."

736
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:02,907
Forty goddamned percent?

737
00:59:03,115 --> 00:59:06,994
I'm the one that's injured, and
this joker sits at a desk all day...

738
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:09,622
...and he wants
almost half of my reward?

739
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,791
- Erin, can I...?
- But then...

740
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,502
...I asked him...

741
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,254
...what he makes
if I don't get anything.

742
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:20,758
Then I don't get anything either.

743
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:23,177
Plus, he's out all the costs.

744
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:25,805
So I realized...

745
00:59:26,055 --> 00:59:27,682
...he's taking a chance too.

746
00:59:37,024 --> 00:59:38,526
You got a pen, honey?

747
00:59:44,323 --> 00:59:45,449
All right, then.

748
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,621
Oh, I made a bundt cake.

749
00:59:50,913 --> 00:59:53,207
Who would like coffee and cake?

750
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:55,668
- I do.
- Thanks, but we have to get back.

751
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:59,797
Have a fucking cup of coffee, Ed.

752
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:01,924
Coffee will be great. Thank you.

753
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:04,593
- All right.
- I'll help you.

754
01:00:09,348 --> 01:00:11,892
My wife makes really good bundt cake.

755
01:00:12,268 --> 01:00:13,978
I love bundt cake.

756
01:00:16,939 --> 01:00:21,402
Well, it seems like everybody in
the family ended up with a rash somehow.

757
01:00:22,111 --> 01:00:25,614
It seemed like no matter what
we did, it always came back.

758
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:28,534
Over what kind of period of time?

759
01:00:28,743 --> 01:00:32,747
Oh, long time, you know, years.
I never did keep track of it.

760
01:00:32,955 --> 01:00:36,083
Kids are sick.
Animals need to be fed.

761
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,960
Just couldn't get rid of it.

762
01:00:39,587 --> 01:00:41,589
Well, Mrs. De Soto said...

763
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:44,925
...that she wasn't
exactly sure what you had.

764
01:00:45,134 --> 01:00:46,385
We know what it is.

765
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:49,847
- It's gastrointestinal...
- Gastrointestinal cancer.

766
01:00:50,056 --> 01:00:53,267
- She got sick about nine months ago...
- Nine months ago.

767
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:56,354
And they operated on her
about six months ago.

768
01:00:56,562 --> 01:00:58,064
- The intestine.
- Right.

769
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:11,535
- Hi. I'm Erin Brock...
- I know who you are.

770
01:01:11,744 --> 01:01:13,412
Donna called me.

771
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:16,123
Can I come in?

772
01:01:16,582 --> 01:01:19,293
We're not interested
in getting involved.

773
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,214
Can I ask why?

774
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:25,508
What's the point?

775
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,430
Donna told me that you've been sick
and that your kids were sick...

776
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:34,266
You people don't give a shit.

777
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:37,395
Anything to get what you want.

778
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:46,862
<i>Thanks for having</i> me...

779
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,907
It's a good day to come by.
She's feeling good.

780
01:01:50,116 --> 01:01:52,493
Well, Mike Ambrosino had remembered...

781
01:01:52,702 --> 01:01:55,413
...that he had seen
you folks at the hospital.

782
01:01:55,621 --> 01:01:57,456
That's what brought me out here.

783
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,628
Yeah, we've been there
from time to time.

784
01:02:03,129 --> 01:02:05,715
And you! Wooftie!

785
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,008
Ain't you a beauty?

786
01:02:07,717 --> 01:02:09,802
You drive all the boys
crazy, don't you?

787
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:13,055
I can see it in your eyes.
You drive them wild.

788
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:14,932
You do, don't you?

789
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:16,600
Torture them.

790
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:18,269
It's good for them.

791
01:02:20,396 --> 01:02:22,648
Don't teach her anything too early.

792
01:02:23,566 --> 01:02:26,402
Yeah, she can't wait
to get on her new dress.

793
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,112
She wants to go to school.

794
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:30,865
We're trying to do that,
in a few months.

795
01:02:31,073 --> 01:02:33,743
Yeah, get her out
of her nightgown here.

796
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:38,706
She's gonna do it.

797
01:02:56,724 --> 01:02:57,975
Absolutely not.

798
01:02:58,184 --> 01:03:00,269
- Why not?
- Because I said no.

799
01:03:00,478 --> 01:03:02,563
The reason PG&E even talks to us...

800
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:05,608
...is because this is a quiet
real-estate dispute.

801
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,445
We add plaintiffs, we're in
the middle of a toxic-trot...

802
01:03:09,654 --> 01:03:12,531
...with a statute problem,
against a massive utility.

803
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,574
No, thank you.

804
01:03:13,783 --> 01:03:15,493
Okay, so here's what I'll do.

805
01:03:15,701 --> 01:03:19,455
I'll go to the Daniels',
the nicest people you'll ever meet...

806
01:03:19,664 --> 01:03:22,792
...who watch their girl fight
like a dog against cancer.

807
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,043
I'll tell them...

808
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:28,089
...we can't help them, because you
just don't wanna work that hard.

809
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:29,799
Work hard?

810
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:31,926
Let me tell you something.

811
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:33,636
I've worked all my life.

812
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:38,140
I've built a firm and kept it alive
through lawsuits and injunctions.

813
01:03:38,432 --> 01:03:41,435
I've survived
a quadruple bypass, cancer...

814
01:03:41,644 --> 01:03:44,105
...being born with one
kidney and diabetes.

815
01:03:44,313 --> 01:03:47,108
I personally managed
to save a million dollars...

816
01:03:47,316 --> 01:03:49,986
...over 30 years, getting
clients 10 times that.

817
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,405
Don't tell me I don't work hard!

818
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:56,158
Don't tell me I can't stop,
take a breath and enjoy life.

819
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:58,869
What the hell do you know
about any of this?

820
01:03:59,286 --> 01:04:02,289
Something like this, Erin,
it could take forever.

821
01:04:02,498 --> 01:04:04,208
They're a huge corporation!

822
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:06,585
They'll bury us
in paperwork for years.

823
01:04:06,794 --> 01:04:09,255
I'm just a guy with
a small, private firm!

824
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:13,551
Who knows they poisoned
people and lied about it.

825
01:04:14,302 --> 01:04:15,761
We can get these people.

826
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:19,807
With a little effort, I think we
can nail their asses to the wall.

827
01:04:20,016 --> 01:04:22,435
With your legal expertise,
you believe that?

828
01:04:22,643 --> 01:04:25,354
- Don't you ever just know?
- Do you know about money?

829
01:04:25,563 --> 01:04:27,231
They settle due to lack of money.

830
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,735
You know what toxicologists
and geology experts cost?

831
01:04:30,943 --> 01:04:32,820
We're looking at $100,000 a month.

832
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:36,240
- I've already spent some of my savings.
- We'll figure it out.

833
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:40,411
I don't know shit, but I know the
difference between right and wrong!

834
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:43,497
- Lovers' quarrel?
- Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.

835
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,754
I feel you looking at me.

836
01:04:53,424 --> 01:04:55,509
I'm sorry.

837
01:04:57,595 --> 01:05:00,097
How many families are we talking about?

838
01:05:00,306 --> 01:05:02,892
Four more. Eleven people so far.

839
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,060
There's more?

840
01:05:04,518 --> 01:05:09,649
I found a document at the water board,
a toxic test well reading from 1967.

841
01:05:09,982 --> 01:05:12,443
More people have lived
there since then.

842
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:17,156
This is a whole different ball game.
A much bigger deal.

843
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:20,868
Kind of like David
and what's- his-name.

844
01:05:22,703 --> 01:05:26,666
Kind of like David and what's-
his-name's whole fucking family.

845
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:30,211
Here's the deal.

846
01:05:30,419 --> 01:05:35,341
If, and only if, you find all the
evidence to back this up, I'll do it.

847
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:37,176
You're doing the right thing.

848
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:41,597
Remind me of that when
I'm filing for bankruptcy.

849
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:47,269
Of course, gathering
evidence is a big job.

850
01:05:47,478 --> 01:05:49,772
Hell of a lot bigger than just filing.

851
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:51,691
I'll be working a lot harder...

852
01:05:51,899 --> 01:05:54,819
...taking on a lot
more responsibility.

853
01:05:55,027 --> 01:05:57,488
- I don't believe this.
- A raise wouldn't hurt.

854
01:05:57,697 --> 01:05:59,407
I'll spend more time in my car...

855
01:05:59,615 --> 01:06:02,994
...so I'll probably be needing
one of those cell phones.

856
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:06,831
- I don't believe this.
- Just a little phone.

857
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:16,692
Thank you!

858
01:07:23,866 --> 01:07:26,327
<i>Whoever is behind you.</i>

859
01:07:27,328 --> 01:07:28,454
Just play.

860
01:07:28,663 --> 01:07:32,124
Go, roll the dice and play.

861
01:07:34,168 --> 01:07:36,379
Come on, aren't you gonna play?

862
01:07:36,587 --> 01:07:38,756
Roll the dice.

863
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:40,424
Come on.

864
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:44,887
Hello.

865
01:07:45,096 --> 01:07:49,642
<i>Is this the Erin Brockovich that's</i>
<i>been snooping around the water board?</i>

866
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,185
Yeah. Who's this?

867
01:07:51,394 --> 01:07:52,853
<i>You should watch your step.</i>

868
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:57,066
<i>A young lady with three young</i>
<i>children really should think again.</i>

869
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:58,192
Who is this?

870
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:01,946
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

871
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:09,412
<i>Who is it?</i>

872
01:08:11,122 --> 01:08:12,623
<i>It's okay.</i>

873
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:18,796
I'm not gonna quit because of
one creepy phone call, George.

874
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:20,506
Come on, Erin.

875
01:08:21,632 --> 01:08:23,384
A job shouldn't put you in danger.

876
01:08:23,592 --> 01:08:24,719
I'm not in danger.

877
01:08:24,927 --> 01:08:27,388
- The phone might be tapped but...
- What?

878
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:30,975
That's usual. We've got a dead
bolt, it's not a big deal.

879
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,770
You don't think you're
a little out of your league?

880
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:38,107
That's what those PG&E
fucks want me to think.

881
01:08:38,316 --> 01:08:39,567
But they're wrong.

882
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:42,486
Erin, there are plenty
of jobs out there.

883
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:44,280
How would you know?

884
01:08:53,748 --> 01:08:55,541
What that's supposed to mean?

885
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,170
You got a problem with me caring
for your kids instead of a job?

886
01:08:59,378 --> 01:09:00,546
I can get a job.

887
01:09:00,755 --> 01:09:03,841
You can leave the kids with
the chicken-fat lady again.

888
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,385
I said I'm sorry.
Keep your voice down.

889
01:09:06,594 --> 01:09:10,139
I know what these kids can
sleep through, better than you.

890
01:09:24,153 --> 01:09:26,197
Scott, tell me something.

891
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:28,741
Does PG&E pay you
to cover their ass?

892
01:09:28,949 --> 01:09:32,036
Or do you just do it out
of the kindness of your heart?

893
01:09:32,495 --> 01:09:35,039
I don't know what
you're talking about.

894
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:36,999
Nobody calls me Pattee.

895
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:41,629
That sicko that called could've
only found out about me from you.

896
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:44,006
People are dying, Scott.

897
01:09:44,215 --> 01:09:46,300
You've got document after document...

898
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:50,388
...that says why, and you
haven't said one word about it.

899
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:54,725
I wanna know how the hell
you sleep at night.

900
01:10:15,037 --> 01:10:19,166
I'm about to drive off the road,
I'm so tired. Keep me awake.

901
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,086
What do you want, a joke?

902
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,631
No, I don't want a joke.

903
01:10:26,132 --> 01:10:28,467
Tell me about what went on back there.

904
01:10:30,219 --> 01:10:33,347
Come to think of it,
we had a big event around here.

905
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:38,436
Beth started talking.

906
01:10:40,855 --> 01:10:41,897
What?

907
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:45,609
Beth? My Beth?

908
01:10:45,818 --> 01:10:47,153
<i>We were sitting around...</i>

909
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:50,865
...and she pointed

910
01:10:51,574 --> 01:10:52,742
" Ball."

911
01:10:53,868 --> 01:10:55,411
Out of the blue like that.

912
01:10:58,247 --> 01:10:59,915
<i>It was pretty intense.</i>

913
01:11:00,124 --> 01:11:02,418
<i>You know, seeing</i>
<i>somebody's first word.</i>

914
01:11:02,627 --> 01:11:07,548
<i>Of all the words in her life,</i>
"ball."</i>

915
01:11:10,134 --> 01:11:12,345
<i>She pointed her little finger...</i>

916
01:11:13,137 --> 01:11:16,098
<i>... with her beautiful, soft,</i>
<i>chubby little arm...</i>

917
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:18,059
<i>... and her cheeks.</i>

918
01:11:18,267 --> 01:11:21,145
<i>It's like she'd been</i>
<i>looking at it for months...</i>

919
01:11:21,354 --> 01:11:24,440
<i>... and couldn't get it out,</i>
<i>but knowing what it was.</i>

920
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:26,776
<i>She didn't look away or anything.</i>

921
01:11:26,984 --> 01:11:29,528
<i>She was just sitting</i>
<i>there with her arm out.</i>

922
01:11:29,737 --> 01:11:32,531
<i>You should've seen</i>
<i>Matthew and Katie and me.</i>

923
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,283
<i>Our jaws just dropped.</i>

924
01:11:34,492 --> 01:11:38,663
<i>We must've stood there for three or</i>
<i>four minutes and just looked at her.</i>

925
01:11:38,871 --> 01:11:42,041
<i>She just had her arm out</i>
<i>like that. "Ball."</i>

926
01:11:42,249 --> 01:11:45,086
<i>And, you know, her little</i>
<i>lips wrapped around it.</i>

927
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:48,422
<i>It was great.</i>

928
01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:50,299
<i>It was intense.</i>

929
01:11:57,765 --> 01:12:00,685
I brought some stuff that
you might be interested in.

930
01:12:00,893 --> 01:12:03,938
My name's Erin, and
I'll be here all day.

931
01:12:04,146 --> 01:12:06,440
Let's go over to these
nice ladies. Hi.

932
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:08,025
- How are you?
- Good.

933
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:12,154
I brought some information today,
if you wanna have a look at it.

934
01:12:12,363 --> 01:12:14,782
If you have any
questions, let me know.

935
01:12:14,991 --> 01:12:17,827
Hi. Excuse me, ladies, I'm Ed Masry.

936
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:21,872
I'm the lawyer involved in the case.
You might like to read these.

937
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:24,333
If you have questions,
I'm here all day.

938
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:27,003
- Sounds good. Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

939
01:12:28,045 --> 01:12:29,588
Is your phone number in this?

940
01:12:30,715 --> 01:12:33,676
There's more important
information than that in there.

941
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:36,470
I'm bored.

942
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:38,139
So are the kids.

943
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:40,808
I'm a little busy, honey.

944
01:12:41,017 --> 01:12:43,311
We invited these people.
Ed and I have to...

945
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,396
I'm sorry. You know what?

946
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:47,523
Please, I have an idea.

947
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:49,108
Can you take her?

948
01:12:49,317 --> 01:12:52,653
She's getting heavy, and I'll
work faster if you take her.

949
01:13:03,581 --> 01:13:04,874
Got a knee for me?

950
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:08,586
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetness.

951
01:13:08,794 --> 01:13:10,463
- Guess what?
- What?

952
01:13:10,671 --> 01:13:12,506
I would like to go home.

953
01:13:12,715 --> 01:13:13,591
Everything's done?

954
01:13:13,799 --> 01:13:15,051
We got a lot done.

955
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:17,887
Did you? I think
I ate three watermelons.

956
01:13:18,095 --> 01:13:19,138
Piggyback!

957
01:13:19,347 --> 01:13:20,890
Let's go, brother. Get on.

958
01:13:21,098 --> 01:13:22,558
Careful.

959
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:24,226
Here, get on me, now.

960
01:13:24,435 --> 01:13:26,520
Erin, excuse me.

961
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:29,857
This is Nelson Perez, he works
at the compressor station.

962
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:32,443
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- PG&E.

963
01:13:32,652 --> 01:13:34,362
Oh, hi.

964
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:37,740
- I've come at a bad time.
- No.

965
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:41,035
- Can you just give me one...?
- Of course. Sure.

966
01:13:41,243 --> 01:13:42,912
Thank you.

967
01:13:45,915 --> 01:13:46,916
You know what?

968
01:13:47,124 --> 01:13:51,128
Why don't you guys go ahead without
me, and I'll get a ride with Ed.

969
01:13:51,337 --> 01:13:54,465
- No, Mom.
- No, sweetie, I'll be right behind you.

970
01:13:54,674 --> 01:13:56,759
I'll be right behind you, all right?

971
01:13:57,093 --> 01:14:01,889
- I really... This is so...
- Fine. Go, go, go.

972
01:14:05,309 --> 01:14:06,894
Get down, bud.

973
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:12,400
Hang on tight there.

974
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:15,027
Help your sister
with her shoes. Let's go.

975
01:14:32,003 --> 01:14:35,256
This is so helpful.
Is it okay if I write this down?

976
01:14:35,464 --> 01:14:36,882
I have so many questions.

977
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:40,553
I wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers, just everything.

978
01:14:40,553 --> 01:14:41,679
I wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers, just everything.

979
01:14:41,887 --> 01:14:47,018
They use the hexachrome here, in these
cooling towers, as an anticorrosive.

980
01:14:47,268 --> 01:14:50,271
Then they dump the excess
water into these ponds.

981
01:14:50,646 --> 01:14:53,441
I don't remember seeing
any ponds up there.

982
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:56,610
They've been covered over,
and not too carefully.

983
01:14:56,819 --> 01:14:59,363
If you dig one inch
under the surface...

984
01:14:59,572 --> 01:15:01,699
...dirt's as green
as a fucking shamrock.

985
01:15:01,907 --> 01:15:04,410
And that's what
caused the contamination?

986
01:15:04,618 --> 01:15:08,456
It didn't help, but no.
The problem started on the bottom.

987
01:15:08,748 --> 01:15:10,791
According to...

988
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,295
...this...

989
01:15:14,503 --> 01:15:17,131
...in most cases you would
line these ponds...

990
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,634
...so the shit didn't seep
into the ground.

991
01:15:20,259 --> 01:15:23,721
- But guess what?
- They skipped that step?

992
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:26,807
Here are the ponds,
the plume comes down...

993
01:15:27,016 --> 01:15:29,310
...and Hinkley is down here...

994
01:15:29,518 --> 01:15:32,938
...it's 14 years of hexachrome
flowing into the groundwater.

995
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:34,982
Jesus.

996
01:15:36,025 --> 01:15:38,569
This guy just offered
all this information?

997
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:42,073
Well, yeah. Nelson cares
what's in those ponds.

998
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:45,868
He used to spend time wading
around them. That was his job.

999
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:47,286
Shit.

1000
01:15:54,794 --> 01:15:55,670
What's the matter?

1001
01:15:58,214 --> 01:16:00,633
I don't know if we can pull this off.

1002
01:16:01,759 --> 01:16:05,721
This is a monster case.
We're up to 411 plaintiffs.

1003
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:10,810
We've taken 162 declarations.

1004
01:16:11,018 --> 01:16:14,605
Probably hundreds more
out there have moved away.

1005
01:16:14,897 --> 01:16:17,191
We have to find them,
it's taking time.

1006
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,485
Money's going out,
nothing's coming in.

1007
01:16:19,694 --> 01:16:21,696
I have to take a second mortgage.

1008
01:16:21,904 --> 01:16:23,614
- So?
- So!

1009
01:16:26,993 --> 01:16:28,577
I have to tell you.

1010
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:33,249
I've been making inquiries
with other firms...

1011
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:36,919
...bigger firms to share
some of the cost.

1012
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,839
They all said no,
said they don't have it.

1013
01:16:41,966 --> 01:16:43,676
We got PG&E by the balls.

1014
01:16:43,884 --> 01:16:48,055
PG&E Hinkley, but nobody'll get rich
unless we pin this on Corporate...

1015
01:16:48,264 --> 01:16:50,349
...in San Francisco.
- What do you mean?

1016
01:16:50,558 --> 01:16:53,811
PG&E Corporate claims they
didn't know about Hinkley.

1017
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,063
They knew. They had to know.

1018
01:16:56,272 --> 01:16:58,024
Show me the document to prove it.

1019
01:17:00,985 --> 01:17:05,114
Then they didn't know. If so, we
can't hit them with punitive damages.

1020
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:08,784
With punitive damages,
it's a sum of money that can...

1021
01:17:08,993 --> 01:17:12,997
...have some effect
on these people's lives.

1022
01:17:14,332 --> 01:17:15,708
So what do we do now?

1023
01:17:20,254 --> 01:17:24,842
Let's assume there are documents
connecting PG&E Hinkley and Corporate...

1024
01:17:25,051 --> 01:17:26,719
...and they know about them.

1025
01:17:27,219 --> 01:17:31,766
We take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up...

1026
01:17:32,058 --> 01:17:34,435
...we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction.

1027
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:38,648
See if they offer a reasonable
settlement, or throw more paper at us.

1028
01:17:39,148 --> 01:17:40,733
Sounds great. Let's do that.

1029
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:42,151
There's a downside.

1030
01:17:43,486 --> 01:17:45,946
PG&E will submit a demurrer.

1031
01:17:46,155 --> 01:17:48,407
A list attacking each complaint...

1032
01:17:48,616 --> 01:17:51,452
...claiming that each cause
of action has no merit.

1033
01:17:51,661 --> 01:17:53,829
And if the judge agrees with them...

1034
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:57,500
...he'll dismiss our case.
PG&E will have no reason to settle.

1035
01:17:58,334 --> 01:18:00,127
Then it's all over.

1036
01:18:06,175 --> 01:18:08,469
So basically it all comes down to...

1037
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:11,764
...what this one judge decides.

1038
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:14,517
Basically, yeah.

1039
01:18:15,726 --> 01:18:17,228
Jesus.

1040
01:19:00,896 --> 01:19:03,941
Well, I'd got so used
to having them come up benign.

1041
01:19:05,776 --> 01:19:08,738
Guess I just didn't expect it.

1042
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:13,534
I sure wish I would've had longer
to get used to the idea.

1043
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:19,248
You think if you got no uterus...

1044
01:19:19,457 --> 01:19:22,877
...and no breasts...

1045
01:19:23,085 --> 01:19:25,880
...you're still technically a woman?

1046
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,634
Sure you are.

1047
01:19:29,842 --> 01:19:31,636
Yeah, you just...

1048
01:19:31,844 --> 01:19:34,430
You're actually a happier woman.

1049
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:37,683
No need to worry
about maxi-pads and underwire.

1050
01:19:45,232 --> 01:19:47,026
We're gonna get them, aren't we?

1051
01:19:47,401 --> 01:19:50,446
You gotta promise me
that we're gonna get them.

1052
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:09,715
<i>I have before me</i>
<i>a complaint on behalf of residents...</i>

1053
01:20:12,843 --> 01:20:17,014
<i>... of Hinkley, California, who</i>
<i>have filed against PG&E.</i>

1054
01:20:17,223 --> 01:20:20,226
For damages, medical expenses
and personal trauma...

1055
01:20:20,434 --> 01:20:25,147
...due to contamination of the ground
water in their area by the defendant.

1056
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:29,110
And I have here 84 motions
to strike and demurrers...

1057
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:33,280
...submitted by representatives
of Pacific Gas & Electric.

1058
01:20:33,489 --> 01:20:36,701
Each one attacking
the validity of this complaint.

1059
01:20:37,576 --> 01:20:40,913
I have reviewed all of
the information carefully.

1060
01:20:41,414 --> 01:20:43,499
I'm ready to give my decision.

1061
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,711
Before I do, is there
anything anyone wants to say?

1062
01:20:47,753 --> 01:20:50,381
- No, Your Honour.
- No, Your Honour.

1063
01:20:51,549 --> 01:20:52,800
Very well.

1064
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:57,805
In the matter of the plaintiffs
of Hinkley, California vs. PG&E...

1065
01:20:58,014 --> 01:21:02,226
...it is the order of this court that
each of the 84 motions to strike...

1066
01:21:02,435 --> 01:21:05,062
...and demurrers are denied.

1067
01:21:05,271 --> 01:21:10,109
And the causes of action against
Pacific Gas and Electric are upheld.

1068
01:21:10,943 --> 01:21:12,486
On a more personal note...

1069
01:21:13,112 --> 01:21:17,158
...as a resident here in Barstow,
which is not far from Hinkley...

1070
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:19,869
...I am disturbed by reference...

1071
01:21:20,077 --> 01:21:24,999
...to evidence that suggests that not
only was hexavalent chromium used...

1072
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:29,670
...but that your clients
actually sent these residents...

1073
01:21:29,879 --> 01:21:32,923
...pamphlets telling them
that it was good for them.

1074
01:21:34,175 --> 01:21:36,302
Tell your clients
they're going to trial.

1075
01:21:48,064 --> 01:21:51,233
Jesus. They look
like the Secret Service.

1076
01:21:52,026 --> 01:21:53,819
Intimidation.

1077
01:21:55,655 --> 01:21:57,782
Let the games begin.

1078
01:21:58,074 --> 01:22:00,284
Show them into the conference room.

1079
01:22:02,578 --> 01:22:04,330
Donald, Anna...

1080
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:07,792
...I wanna talk to you for a minute.

1081
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:13,547
Counsellors.

1082
01:22:13,756 --> 01:22:14,715
Counsellors.

1083
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:23,307
Let's be honest.

1084
01:22:23,933 --> 01:22:27,353
$20,000,000 is more than
these people have ever dreamed of.

1085
01:22:28,688 --> 01:22:30,398
Now that pisses me off.

1086
01:22:31,357 --> 01:22:35,152
First of all, since the demurrer,
we have more than 400 plaintiffs.

1087
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:37,655
Let's be honest, we know there's more.

1088
01:22:37,905 --> 01:22:41,117
They may not be sophisticated,
but they can divide...

1089
01:22:41,325 --> 01:22:44,245
...and $20,000,000
isn't shit after splitting it.

1090
01:22:44,453 --> 01:22:45,538
Second of all...

1091
01:22:45,746 --> 01:22:47,707
...they don't dream of being rich.

1092
01:22:47,915 --> 01:22:50,793
They dream about
watching their kids in a pool...

1093
01:22:51,002 --> 01:22:54,588
...without worrying that
they'll have a hysterectomy at 20.

1094
01:22:54,797 --> 01:22:56,590
Like Rosa Diaz, our client.

1095
01:22:56,882 --> 01:23:01,470
Or have their spine deteriorate, like
Stan Bloom, another client of ours.

1096
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,516
So before you come back here
with another lame-ass offer...

1097
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:09,645
...I want you to think real
hard about what your spine is worth.

1098
01:23:10,062 --> 01:23:13,232
Or what you expect someone
to pay you for your uterus.

1099
01:23:13,983 --> 01:23:17,695
Then take out your calculator
and multiply that number by 100.

1100
01:23:18,154 --> 01:23:21,073
Anything less than that
is a waste of our time.

1101
01:23:23,451 --> 01:23:26,662
We had that water brought
in special for you folks.

1102
01:23:26,871 --> 01:23:27,913
Came from Hinkley.

1103
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:46,641
I think this meeting's over.

1104
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:48,726
Damn right it is.

1105
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:30,017
What the fuck? Did a bomb blow up?
You letting the kids run wild?

1106
01:24:40,778 --> 01:24:41,779
What's that?

1107
01:24:52,081 --> 01:24:54,000
I saw them in a mall one day.

1108
01:24:55,543 --> 01:24:57,128
I said, " Damn...

1109
01:24:57,795 --> 01:25:00,381
...they'll look good on
those beautiful ears."

1110
01:25:02,591 --> 01:25:07,430
I bought them and I said, "When Erin
does something nice, I'll surprise her."

1111
01:25:09,056 --> 01:25:11,100
You know how long ago that was?

1112
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:14,854
Six months ago.

1113
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,110
- I'm sorry, I've just...
- And so what I'm thinking is...

1114
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:28,159
Either you gotta find
a different job or a different guy.

1115
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:31,746
I mean...

1116
01:25:33,289 --> 01:25:36,959
There may be many men out there
who don't mind being the maid...

1117
01:25:37,168 --> 01:25:39,837
...and getting nothing.
But I ain't one of them.

1118
01:25:42,632 --> 01:25:44,216
I can't leave my job, George.

1119
01:25:44,467 --> 01:25:45,926
Yes, you can.

1120
01:25:46,844 --> 01:25:48,763
People do it all the time.

1121
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:51,974
How can you ask me to do that?

1122
01:25:53,684 --> 01:25:55,519
This job...

1123
01:25:57,063 --> 01:26:01,233
For the first time in my
life, I got people respecting me.

1124
01:26:01,442 --> 01:26:02,902
Up in Hinkley...

1125
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:07,448
...I walk into a room, everybody shuts
up to hear what I have to say.

1126
01:26:07,657 --> 01:26:10,743
I never had that before, ever.

1127
01:26:11,577 --> 01:26:13,579
Please, don't ask me to give it up.

1128
01:26:13,955 --> 01:26:15,581
What about your kids?

1129
01:26:16,624 --> 01:26:20,419
I'm doing more for them now
than I did living with my parents.

1130
01:26:20,628 --> 01:26:22,046
One day they'll see it.

1131
01:26:22,254 --> 01:26:24,924
- Well, what about me?
- What about you?

1132
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,764
You think the men
who gave me those children...

1133
01:26:31,973 --> 01:26:35,142
...asked me what I
wanted before walking away?

1134
01:26:35,351 --> 01:26:38,771
All I've ever done
is bend my life around...

1135
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,273
...what men decide they need.

1136
01:26:41,482 --> 01:26:44,527
Well, not now.
I'm sorry. I won't do it.

1137
01:26:44,735 --> 01:26:45,778
Well...

1138
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:49,115
Erin, I'm not them. So...

1139
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:52,076
What more can I do
to prove that to you?

1140
01:26:53,244 --> 01:26:54,537
Stay.

1141
01:27:10,678 --> 01:27:12,054
What for?

1142
01:27:14,765 --> 01:27:16,267
I mean, you got a raise.

1143
01:27:16,475 --> 01:27:18,769
You can afford daycare.
You don't need me.

1144
01:28:03,856 --> 01:28:05,024
Hi.

1145
01:28:21,082 --> 01:28:22,500
We can get them, Pamela.

1146
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:25,044
We can.

1147
01:28:25,503 --> 01:28:28,381
I don't wanna feel it all over again...

1148
01:28:28,589 --> 01:28:31,300
...and then not have it come out right.

1149
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:35,680
I don't know if I could handle that.

1150
01:28:36,597 --> 01:28:38,599
Put the kids through that.

1151
01:28:39,308 --> 01:28:43,270
The thing is, it doesn't matter
whether you win, lose or draw here.

1152
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:48,609
You were lied to. You're sick and your
kids are sick because of those lies.

1153
01:28:51,362 --> 01:28:54,073
You all have to come together...

1154
01:28:54,282 --> 01:28:56,784
...to stand up in
a courtroom and say that.

1155
01:29:02,748 --> 01:29:04,959
I'd bring the kids
into the hospital...

1156
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:09,005
...with towels soaked
from their nosebleeds.

1157
01:29:12,883 --> 01:29:17,596
They called County Services because
they assumed the kids were abused.

1158
01:29:22,476 --> 01:29:25,730
Am I gonna get the best
behaviour in the office?

1159
01:29:25,938 --> 01:29:27,148
No.

1160
01:29:27,356 --> 01:29:32,403
What's with the attitude?
I just need cool, I need quiet.

1161
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:35,323
Hello. Am I alone in the car? Yes?

1162
01:29:35,531 --> 01:29:39,160
- I don't understand why...
- I don't wanna talk about it now.

1163
01:29:39,368 --> 01:29:41,871
- The other moms gave permission.
- I don't care.

1164
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,542
- So when can I get a friggin' answer?
- Don't talk to me like that!

1165
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:48,294
Randy's mom said yes.

1166
01:29:48,502 --> 01:29:52,173
Goddamn it, Randy's mom doesn't
work, and his dad didn't leave her!

1167
01:29:52,381 --> 01:29:54,925
Figuring out who
takes him to roller hockey...

1168
01:29:55,134 --> 01:29:58,304
...is probably easier at
Randy's house. Now cool it.

1169
01:30:03,142 --> 01:30:06,604
I'll be as quick as I can.
Matthew, can you watch your sister?

1170
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,441
- Matthew.
- All right, fine. Come here, Beth.

1171
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:13,653
- Can I come with you?
- No, baby, I'll just be a second.

1172
01:30:49,855 --> 01:30:52,483
Thank you. I'm only
sorry you couldn't meet Erin.

1173
01:30:52,692 --> 01:30:53,818
- I will.
- You will.

1174
01:30:54,026 --> 01:30:56,529
We have a lot of work to do together.

1175
01:30:56,737 --> 01:30:59,615
Thanks for coming.
Erin, I was just talking about you.

1176
01:30:59,824 --> 01:31:03,035
Meet our new partner, Kurt Potter.
He'll handle Hinkley.

1177
01:31:03,244 --> 01:31:05,913
I see what you mean
about a secret weapon.

1178
01:31:06,122 --> 01:31:09,542
Erin, it's great to meet you.
You've done a fabulous job.

1179
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:13,129
- I'll be seeing you.
- Thanks, I appreciate you coming over.

1180
01:31:25,516 --> 01:31:26,350
What?

1181
01:31:26,559 --> 01:31:28,102
Our new partner?

1182
01:31:28,311 --> 01:31:30,730
When was I gonna hear about this?

1183
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:34,525
Just listen. Did I ever tell
you about that airline case?

1184
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:36,861
What the fuck are you talking about?

1185
01:31:37,069 --> 01:31:39,822
A few years back, I was
trying this airline case...

1186
01:31:40,031 --> 01:31:44,493
...and I got my ass kicked by this
guy. He buried me in paper, brutal.

1187
01:31:44,702 --> 01:31:46,871
He's the toughest
I'd ever been up against.

1188
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:48,164
Make a point!

1189
01:31:48,456 --> 01:31:50,374
It was Kurt Potter.

1190
01:31:51,167 --> 01:31:56,297
After the judge's decision, I asked
him to partner, he didn't hesitate.

1191
01:31:56,547 --> 01:32:00,635
He wouldn't hesitate now, we did
all the work. Where was he before?

1192
01:32:00,843 --> 01:32:03,679
Will you listen to me?
It doesn't matter.

1193
01:32:03,888 --> 01:32:06,390
You wanna win this?
He gave me this check.

1194
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:08,893
It covers all our expenses to date...

1195
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:12,438
...and he's got more toxic
tort experience than anyone.

1196
01:32:12,647 --> 01:32:13,981
This is good news!

1197
01:32:18,361 --> 01:32:19,987
I got Pamela Duncan.

1198
01:32:32,541 --> 01:32:34,877
I'll open, Mommy.

1199
01:32:35,086 --> 01:32:38,547
You wanna open the can for
Mommy? Well, here, I'll help you.

1200
01:32:39,298 --> 01:32:40,716
You turn it?

1201
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:45,388
- Hi, George.
- Hi, George. Let's go see.

1202
01:33:11,872 --> 01:33:12,957
Erin Brockovich?

1203
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:15,960
Package from Masry and Vititoe.

1204
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:29,307
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1205
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:34,312
- What's in here?
- Baby.

1206
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,814
There's no baby in here.

1207
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:39,150
- What is it?
- A dolly.

1208
01:33:39,358 --> 01:33:41,610
It's a dolly? It's...

1209
01:33:54,707 --> 01:33:55,875
Lookit.

1210
01:33:58,794 --> 01:34:00,546
" Lookit" is right.

1211
01:34:08,262 --> 01:34:09,764
Do you see that?

1212
01:34:14,143 --> 01:34:16,395
- I want that.
- I want that too.

1213
01:34:16,604 --> 01:34:18,272
It's our lucky day.

1214
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:19,982
Matthew, Katie!

1215
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:34,288
PG&E has requested that we
submit to binding arbitration.

1216
01:34:34,747 --> 01:34:36,040
What's that?

1217
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:41,420
That's where we try the case
without a jury, before a judge.

1218
01:34:41,629 --> 01:34:42,922
It's called a test trial.

1219
01:34:43,214 --> 01:34:46,258
The judge's decision
is final. There's no appeal.

1220
01:34:47,385 --> 01:34:50,680
- How many plaintiffs do you have?
- 634.

1221
01:34:51,681 --> 01:34:54,016
They'll never try
that many all at once.

1222
01:34:54,225 --> 01:34:57,728
So we need to get them together
in groups of 20 or 30.

1223
01:34:57,937 --> 01:35:02,817
Worst cases, the most life-threatened,
the sickest first and so on.

1224
01:35:03,025 --> 01:35:06,404
Each one gets a go before
the judge to determine damages.

1225
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:08,781
PG&E proposes that they're liable...

1226
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:12,785
...anywhere between
50 and 400 million.

1227
01:35:14,287 --> 01:35:17,081
So wait a minute. Let
me just get this straight.

1228
01:35:17,373 --> 01:35:18,457
If we went to trial...

1229
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:22,753
...PG&E could stretch this over
10 years with appeal after appeal.

1230
01:35:22,962 --> 01:35:25,840
- Those people would...
- These people expect a trial.

1231
01:35:26,549 --> 01:35:30,469
That's what we told them, you
and me. They won't understand this.

1232
01:35:32,763 --> 01:35:35,182
Kurt thinks it's the best way to go.

1233
01:35:44,608 --> 01:35:49,071
Look, I promise you that we'll
be very sensitive on this point.

1234
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,198
We'll make sure they see...

1235
01:35:51,407 --> 01:35:55,286
...that this is the only way
we can go forward at this time.

1236
01:35:55,995 --> 01:35:58,080
But we have a lot of work to do...

1237
01:35:58,664 --> 01:36:01,542
...before we even broach that subject.

1238
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:05,129
I'll take Erin down the hall...

1239
01:36:05,338 --> 01:36:09,884
...so we can start on this stuff,
and I'll fill her in on the details.

1240
01:36:10,593 --> 01:36:14,263
- Those are my files.
- Yeah. We had them couriered over.

1241
01:36:14,722 --> 01:36:16,849
Listen, good work.
They're a great start.

1242
01:36:17,058 --> 01:36:20,728
We'll just spend some time
filling in the holes in your research.

1243
01:36:20,936 --> 01:36:25,816
Excuse me... Theresa, is it?
There are no holes in my research.

1244
01:36:26,233 --> 01:36:29,654
There are things we need
you probably didn't know to ask.

1245
01:36:30,154 --> 01:36:32,156
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

1246
01:36:32,365 --> 01:36:34,659
I spent 18 months on this case...

1247
01:36:34,909 --> 01:36:38,412
...and I know more about
the plaintiffs than you ever will.

1248
01:36:39,872 --> 01:36:41,999
You don't even have phone numbers.

1249
01:36:42,416 --> 01:36:43,668
Whose number do you need?

1250
01:36:43,876 --> 01:36:47,254
Everyone's. We need to be
able to contact the plaintiffs.

1251
01:36:47,713 --> 01:36:49,715
I said whose number do you need?

1252
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:53,511
You don't know 600 numbers by heart.

1253
01:37:08,567 --> 01:37:09,777
Annabelle Daniels.

1254
01:37:09,986 --> 01:37:14,115
Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.

1255
01:37:14,323 --> 01:37:17,410
Ten years old. Lived
on the plume since birth.

1256
01:37:17,618 --> 01:37:22,039
Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer,
so she spent every minute in the pool.

1257
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:24,417
They detected a tumour in her brain.

1258
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:27,545
An operation shrunk it,
with radiation after that.

1259
01:37:27,795 --> 01:37:29,422
Her parents are Ted and Rita.

1260
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:34,719
Ted's got Crohn's disease. Rita has
headaches and underwent a hysterectomy.

1261
01:37:35,011 --> 01:37:38,973
Ted grew up in Hinkley. His
brother and his wife and their kids...

1262
01:37:39,181 --> 01:37:43,269
...Robbie Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose
and Peter also lived on the plume.

1263
01:37:43,477 --> 01:37:45,646
Their number is 454-9554.

1264
01:37:45,896 --> 01:37:47,773
You want their diseases?

1265
01:37:53,195 --> 01:37:55,364
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1266
01:37:55,573 --> 01:37:59,452
That's all you got, lady, two
wrong feet in fucking ugly shoes.

1267
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:09,253
- She insulted me.
- Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding.

1268
01:38:09,462 --> 01:38:12,506
Instead of being polite and
treating her with respect...

1269
01:38:12,715 --> 01:38:14,175
Why should I respect her?

1270
01:38:14,383 --> 01:38:19,138
Just because she's not supporting kids
with no husband, she's not an idiot!

1271
01:38:19,347 --> 01:38:21,557
Just because she
dresses like a lawyer...

1272
01:38:21,766 --> 01:38:25,269
...doesn't mean she didn't
work her ass off in law school.

1273
01:38:25,478 --> 01:38:27,605
Excuse me for not going to law school.

1274
01:38:27,813 --> 01:38:31,692
Law school? At this point,
I'd settle for charm school!

1275
01:38:40,076 --> 01:38:41,285
Mr. Linwood!

1276
01:38:49,627 --> 01:38:51,087
Bob?

1277
01:38:55,675 --> 01:38:59,428
6086 Ridge Road...

1278
01:39:00,304 --> 01:39:03,432
...Hinkley, California. 714...

1279
01:39:05,101 --> 01:39:06,769
...455...

1280
01:39:07,937 --> 01:39:11,148
<i>Okay, now, if you</i>
<i>could walk me through...</i>

1281
01:39:11,482 --> 01:39:16,529
...all of the elements
of Annabelle's illnesses.

1282
01:39:17,822 --> 01:39:19,490
Specific details...

1283
01:39:19,699 --> 01:39:24,578
...when the symptoms began,
prior to the first medical visit.

1284
01:39:25,788 --> 01:39:29,709
If you could reserve sentimental
embellishments, I'd appreciate it...

1285
01:39:29,917 --> 01:39:32,420
...because they won't
help you in court.

1286
01:39:32,628 --> 01:39:35,756
I just need facts, dates, time.

1287
01:39:36,924 --> 01:39:40,011
<i>I know Theresa isn't real</i>
<i>warm, but she's a good lawyer.</i>

1288
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,515
<i>She asks the same questions</i>
<i>you did. I told you everything.</i>

1289
01:39:44,724 --> 01:39:49,228
<i>I don't want her coming to the</i>
<i>house again. She upsets Annabelle.</i>

1290
01:39:49,437 --> 01:39:52,189
Okay, if you don't like
Theresa, that's okay.

1291
01:39:52,398 --> 01:39:55,192
You know how important
Annabelle is to me.

1292
01:39:55,401 --> 01:39:57,403
Ed and I are still here for you.

1293
01:39:57,612 --> 01:40:01,657
I called Ed two days ago, Erin.
He still hasn't called me back.

1294
01:40:01,866 --> 01:40:04,035
Now, I hate to say this, but...

1295
01:40:04,285 --> 01:40:07,038
...everyone's upset
about this arbitration thing.

1296
01:40:07,913 --> 01:40:09,165
What?

1297
01:40:09,373 --> 01:40:11,626
<i>Pamela has written a letter...</i>

1298
01:40:11,834 --> 01:40:14,337
...telling everybody
to get new lawyers.

1299
01:40:14,545 --> 01:40:15,796
That we've been lied to.

1300
01:40:16,213 --> 01:40:18,883
- <i>Is it true?</i>
- No.

1301
01:40:19,383 --> 01:40:20,551
<i>Did you?</i>

1302
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,930
I'm telling you the truth, and
I'll get to the bottom of all of this.

1303
01:40:25,139 --> 01:40:26,599
<i>Don't lie to us.</i>

1304
01:40:26,807 --> 01:40:28,309
I will take care of this.

1305
01:40:28,517 --> 01:40:31,562
- <i>Now, we're trusting you here, so...</i>
- Thanks.

1306
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:33,814
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

1307
01:40:37,318 --> 01:40:39,570
I'm not saying
it's not a strong case.

1308
01:40:39,779 --> 01:40:43,991
Otherwise, they wouldn't have dropped
the demurrers. I wouldn't be here.

1309
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,203
What I am saying is, we
don't have a smoking gun...

1310
01:40:47,411 --> 01:40:49,497
...that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.

1311
01:40:49,705 --> 01:40:52,959
Something that
proves that prior to 1987...

1312
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:58,047
...PG&E Corporate knew the water was
bad there and did nothing about it.

1313
01:40:59,548 --> 01:41:04,136
- Erin, I thought you took a sick day.
- So did I.

1314
01:41:09,934 --> 01:41:13,062
- What's going on in there?
- Meeting about the PG&E thing.

1315
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:15,398
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

1316
01:41:17,483 --> 01:41:20,611
We can find it, or
we don't have a big win.

1317
01:41:21,404 --> 01:41:24,240
Can I take a brief
break here for a moment?

1318
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:26,325
I'll be right back.

1319
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:39,463
- You told me you weren't feeling great.
- Bullshit!

1320
01:41:39,672 --> 01:41:44,593
If I was on my deathbed, if it
helped you, you'd drag me out of it!

1321
01:41:48,848 --> 01:41:50,266
How could you take this away from me?

1322
01:41:50,474 --> 01:41:54,437
- Nobody's taking anything.
- Bullshit! You stuck me in Siberia!

1323
01:41:54,687 --> 01:41:59,358
Dictating to some goddamned clerk
so you could finish this without me.

1324
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:01,360
They screwed up, Erin!

1325
01:42:01,569 --> 01:42:03,904
They screwed up and they admit it.

1326
01:42:04,155 --> 01:42:05,906
The arbitration proposal...

1327
01:42:06,157 --> 01:42:09,910
...could've been written in Sanskrit,
for all the sense it made.

1328
01:42:10,119 --> 01:42:15,124
I know. I spoke to Ted. Pamela Duncan
wouldn't even get on the phone with me!

1329
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:17,627
Pamela made everybody
mad with that letter.

1330
01:42:17,835 --> 01:42:19,295
She called us thieves.

1331
01:42:19,503 --> 01:42:21,547
- The whole thing's falling apart.
- Why?

1332
01:42:21,756 --> 01:42:25,635
Because before we go to arbitration,
the plaintiffs must agree!

1333
01:42:25,843 --> 01:42:29,096
- How many?
- Usually they require about 70%.

1334
01:42:29,305 --> 01:42:32,850
PG&E is demanding 90.
In other words, everybody.

1335
01:42:33,059 --> 01:42:35,144
Do you understand? This is serious.

1336
01:42:35,353 --> 01:42:37,772
And, what, Ed? I'm not serious?

1337
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:40,024
You're emotional, you're erratic.

1338
01:42:40,232 --> 01:42:43,361
You say anything, you make
this personal, and it isn't.

1339
01:42:43,653 --> 01:42:45,154
Not personal?

1340
01:42:45,363 --> 01:42:46,906
That is my work!

1341
01:42:47,114 --> 01:42:49,325
My sweat! My time away from my kids!

1342
01:42:49,533 --> 01:42:52,578
If that's not personal,
I don't know what is.

1343
01:42:58,793 --> 01:43:00,461
Hey, come on.

1344
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:01,963
Come on.

1345
01:43:03,047 --> 01:43:05,049
Go home. Get well.

1346
01:43:05,257 --> 01:43:07,802
Because you're no good to me sick.

1347
01:43:08,594 --> 01:43:10,513
I need you, all right?

1348
01:43:11,222 --> 01:43:13,224
This case needs you.

1349
01:43:15,935 --> 01:43:17,812
Did you tell them that?

1350
01:43:43,337 --> 01:43:46,465
Binding arbitration isn't
that different from a trial.

1351
01:43:46,674 --> 01:43:51,053
It's overseen by a judge. Evidence
is presented in much the same way.

1352
01:43:51,262 --> 01:43:52,888
And then a jury decides?

1353
01:43:53,389 --> 01:43:58,311
Sorry, I forgot to mention that
there's no jury in binding arbitration.

1354
01:43:58,519 --> 01:44:00,313
No jury and no appeal.

1355
01:44:02,231 --> 01:44:05,067
What option do we have if
we don't like the result?

1356
01:44:05,276 --> 01:44:07,361
None. The judge's decision is final.

1357
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:08,487
Not a good answer.

1358
01:44:08,696 --> 01:44:11,699
No, but we don't
anticipate that being a problem.

1359
01:44:11,907 --> 01:44:13,451
As I already told you...

1360
01:44:13,909 --> 01:44:17,580
...it's definitely between
50 and 400,000,000 dollars.

1361
01:44:17,913 --> 01:44:20,166
Well, which?
There's a big difference.

1362
01:44:20,374 --> 01:44:22,376
I wouldn't like to speculate.

1363
01:44:23,919 --> 01:44:27,673
- Well, how does it get divided?
- Yeah, who gets what?

1364
01:44:30,593 --> 01:44:35,222
My medical bills started two years ago,
before some of the other people here.

1365
01:44:35,431 --> 01:44:38,517
My daughter was in and out
of hospitals more than his.

1366
01:44:38,726 --> 01:44:41,437
It shouldn't matter when it started.

1367
01:44:42,772 --> 01:44:45,149
People, listen, please!

1368
01:44:45,358 --> 01:44:49,946
The point we have to address
tonight is getting everyone to agree...

1369
01:44:50,154 --> 01:44:53,199
...that binding arbitration
is better than a trial...

1370
01:44:53,407 --> 01:44:56,953
...that could go on for
10 years before you see any money.

1371
01:44:57,161 --> 01:45:00,456
Maybe some of us
wanna wait 10 years!

1372
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:07,463
Everyone has to agree,
or no one has a chance!

1373
01:45:08,005 --> 01:45:13,010
Those of you about to leave, I'd like
1978!

1374
01:45:13,219 --> 01:45:16,514
That's the year of
the Love Canal controversy.

1375
01:45:16,722 --> 01:45:19,058
They're still
waiting for their money!

1376
01:45:19,266 --> 01:45:22,561
Think about where
you'll be in 15 or 20 years.

1377
01:45:29,402 --> 01:45:32,738
Now, look, everyone.
Is this a big decision?

1378
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:38,077
Absolutely! But I do not
believe this is a sell-out.

1379
01:45:38,411 --> 01:45:41,372
This is the best shot
to get everyone some money now.

1380
01:45:43,666 --> 01:45:46,002
You and I both know...

1381
01:45:46,711 --> 01:45:50,172
...there are people in this
room who can't afford to wait.

1382
01:45:51,465 --> 01:45:52,675
To take that chance.

1383
01:45:53,843 --> 01:45:55,678
Are you gonna make them wait?

1384
01:46:02,685 --> 01:46:04,645
So how many altogether?

1385
01:46:06,605 --> 01:46:11,402
We got just about everybody that came
here, but it leaves us about 150 short.

1386
01:46:11,611 --> 01:46:13,195
Oh, shit.

1387
01:46:15,156 --> 01:46:16,949
We'll have to go door-to-door.

1388
01:46:19,535 --> 01:46:21,662
I gotta go pick up my kids.

1389
01:46:25,916 --> 01:46:28,002
- You need a hand with that?
- No.

1390
01:46:34,425 --> 01:46:35,384
You did good.

1391
01:46:37,178 --> 01:46:38,638
We'll see.

1392
01:47:13,464 --> 01:47:14,924
Thanks for coming.

1393
01:47:20,012 --> 01:47:24,517
Don't take them anywhere on your
bike. I'll give you money for a cab.

1394
01:47:25,184 --> 01:47:26,394
I got money.

1395
01:47:27,103 --> 01:47:29,105
So how long is this gonna take?

1396
01:47:32,233 --> 01:47:33,901
I don't know. A few days.

1397
01:47:35,403 --> 01:47:37,029
Got your own room.

1398
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:51,460
I am really sorry, George.

1399
01:47:53,879 --> 01:47:55,006
Have the kids eaten?

1400
01:47:58,759 --> 01:47:59,760
No.

1401
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:10,331
Wanna get some pancakes?
Come on, let's go.

1402
01:49:10,539 --> 01:49:14,043
Everybody up today.

1403
01:49:14,251 --> 01:49:15,670
All right.

1404
01:49:16,003 --> 01:49:17,213
Come on, baby.

1405
01:49:17,421 --> 01:49:19,840
- What time is it?
- It's early.

1406
01:49:20,091 --> 01:49:22,760
We're taking your
car to go get breakfast.

1407
01:49:24,303 --> 01:49:27,765
- No, I need my car.
- We'll be back in a minute.

1408
01:49:28,975 --> 01:49:30,476
Get some sleep.

1409
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:34,855
Matt, buddy.
Put that down. Let's go.

1410
01:49:35,064 --> 01:49:36,732
I'll be there in a minute.

1411
01:49:38,901 --> 01:49:42,571
Let's go get some
pancakes, girly. Come on.

1412
01:49:51,872 --> 01:49:53,040
Don't play with that.

1413
01:49:53,249 --> 01:49:57,461
It took me so long to get organized.
Would you put that back, please?

1414
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:59,547
This girl's the same age as me.

1415
01:50:05,094 --> 01:50:06,304
Is she sick?

1416
01:50:10,266 --> 01:50:13,185
She is, but that's
why I'm helping her.

1417
01:50:13,394 --> 01:50:15,146
We'll make her feel better.

1418
01:50:15,813 --> 01:50:17,815
Why can't her own mama help her?

1419
01:50:21,027 --> 01:50:22,987
Because she's real sick too.

1420
01:50:36,876 --> 01:50:39,086
I'll bring you back some breakfast.

1421
01:50:40,171 --> 01:50:41,589
You want eggs?

1422
01:50:44,383 --> 01:50:45,968
Eggs would be great.

1423
01:50:54,894 --> 01:50:56,604
Eggs would be perfect.

1424
01:52:07,341 --> 01:52:10,344
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey, Erin. How are you?

1425
01:52:13,514 --> 01:52:15,808
- You been at this all day?
- Yeah.

1426
01:52:16,058 --> 01:52:18,477
- You want some coffee?
- I'd love some.

1427
01:52:18,686 --> 01:52:20,896
- I'll make a fresh pot.
- Thanks.

1428
01:52:47,757 --> 01:52:49,467
Don't I know you?

1429
01:52:49,759 --> 01:52:50,801
I don't think so.

1430
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:53,846
Sure, you were at the barbecue
in Hinkley.

1431
01:52:54,096 --> 01:52:55,931
And at the town meeting.

1432
01:52:57,266 --> 01:52:59,060
I was watching you.

1433
01:53:00,728 --> 01:53:02,605
I had my eye on you.

1434
01:53:05,066 --> 01:53:06,359
Nice.

1435
01:53:06,609 --> 01:53:10,696
You were talking to everybody
and writing down a lot of stuff.

1436
01:53:10,947 --> 01:53:15,743
When I saw you, I said to myself,
"There's something about her.

1437
01:53:16,869 --> 01:53:19,163
I really like that girl."

1438
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,918
- Matt, can I get that coffee to go?
- Sure thing.

1439
01:53:27,463 --> 01:53:29,924
I feel like I can talk to you too.

1440
01:53:31,258 --> 01:53:34,720
Like you're the type of person
I could say anything to.

1441
01:53:36,597 --> 01:53:37,848
- Here you go.
- Great.

1442
01:53:38,099 --> 01:53:39,141
What do I owe you?

1443
01:53:39,392 --> 01:53:42,103
- There's no charge.
- Thanks, Matt.

1444
01:53:42,353 --> 01:53:45,147
Well, nice talking to you.

1445
01:53:45,356 --> 01:53:49,860
Would it be important if, when I worked
at the plant, I destroyed documents?

1446
01:53:55,783 --> 01:53:57,243
Maybe.

1447
01:53:59,203 --> 01:54:00,496
What's your name?

1448
01:54:01,163 --> 01:54:02,873
Charles Embry.

1449
01:54:03,332 --> 01:54:05,167
Charles. Erin.

1450
01:54:05,459 --> 01:54:06,919
Nice to meet you.

1451
01:54:09,422 --> 01:54:13,634
Can you excuse me for a quick...
I'm just gonna run to the...

1452
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:29,525
Oh, come on.

1453
01:54:31,527 --> 01:54:34,822
Oh, you fucking piece of crap
with no signal!

1454
01:54:35,072 --> 01:54:36,449
Fuck!

1455
01:54:54,216 --> 01:54:55,593
<i>Ed. Ed, oh, my God.</i>

1456
01:54:55,968 --> 01:54:59,305
This guy said he destroyed records.
He worked there.

1457
01:54:59,555 --> 01:55:00,431
Slow down.

1458
01:55:00,681 --> 01:55:03,476
<i>I'm trying to relax.</i>
<i>This Charles Embry...</i>

1459
01:55:03,726 --> 01:55:05,269
- Who?
- <i>Charles Embry.</i>

1460
01:55:05,519 --> 01:55:08,397
I thought he was trying to kill me
or pick me up...

1461
01:55:08,648 --> 01:55:12,109
<i>... but why would he use that,</i>
<i>say that? It's crazy.</i>

1462
01:55:14,779 --> 01:55:18,741
Shit. Go back and see if he'll
make a declaration.

1463
01:55:18,991 --> 01:55:20,034
A declaration.

1464
01:55:20,242 --> 01:55:22,453
<i>But be careful.</i>
<i>Don't scare him off.</i>

1465
01:55:23,037 --> 01:55:25,706
And stay calm. Stay calm.

1466
01:55:25,957 --> 01:55:29,085
If it weren't for you,
I'd be in Palm Springs now.

1467
01:55:29,335 --> 01:55:31,754
<i>You're good at talking people</i>
<i>into things.</i>

1468
01:55:32,004 --> 01:55:36,926
Don't pepper him with questions.
Don't do that. Just...

1469
01:55:37,134 --> 01:55:40,972
People wanna tell their story.
Just let him talk. Let him...

1470
01:55:41,222 --> 01:55:43,933
<i>... do all the talking. All right?</i>

1471
01:55:48,562 --> 01:55:50,273
Oh, sorry.

1472
01:55:54,735 --> 01:55:56,946
Would you like another beer, or...

1473
01:56:05,579 --> 01:56:07,581
My cousin passed away yesterday.

1474
01:56:10,918 --> 01:56:12,503
He had kidney tumours...

1475
01:56:12,753 --> 01:56:16,757
...no colon, his intestines
were eaten away.

1476
01:56:16,966 --> 01:56:18,843
Forty-one years old.

1477
01:56:20,303 --> 01:56:22,513
I remember seeing him
over at the plant.

1478
01:56:22,763 --> 01:56:25,975
He'd be cleaning
the cooling towers, wearing...

1479
01:56:26,225 --> 01:56:28,019
What do you call them?

1480
01:56:28,227 --> 01:56:31,105
- A mask?
- Yeah, doctors' masks.

1481
01:56:32,481 --> 01:56:35,526
And it'd be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds.

1482
01:56:49,081 --> 01:56:51,208
I was working in the compressor.

1483
01:56:51,459 --> 01:56:55,046
The supervisor calls me

1484
01:56:55,296 --> 01:56:57,048
"We'll give you a shredder...

1485
01:56:57,298 --> 01:57:00,968
...and send you to the warehouse
to shred the documents we stored."

1486
01:57:03,304 --> 01:57:04,847
He say why?

1487
01:57:05,848 --> 01:57:08,851
Nope. And I didn't ask.

1488
01:57:12,855 --> 01:57:15,358
Did you look at the stuff
you destroyed?

1489
01:57:15,608 --> 01:57:18,402
It was a lot of dull
vacation schedules and stuff.

1490
01:57:20,029 --> 01:57:23,824
Then there were memos about
the holding ponds, the water in them.

1491
01:57:24,075 --> 01:57:28,537
And readings from the test wells,
stuff like that.

1492
01:57:32,625 --> 01:57:34,961
You were told to destroy those?

1493
01:57:35,294 --> 01:57:36,379
That's right.

1494
01:57:38,881 --> 01:57:40,841
Course, as it turns out...

1495
01:57:41,092 --> 01:57:43,970
...I wasn't a very good employee.

1496
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:02,071
- Good morning!
- Morning.

1497
01:58:02,697 --> 01:58:04,782
Ed. Erin, what's this?

1498
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:08,119
- May I?
- Yep. Go ahead.

1499
01:58:08,327 --> 01:58:10,955
Well, you know what, Mr. Potter?

1500
01:58:11,205 --> 01:58:14,166
We completely forgot
your birthday this year.

1501
01:58:14,417 --> 01:58:18,129
Seeing as how you've been so good
to me, it's a terrible oversight.

1502
01:58:18,379 --> 01:58:22,425
So Ed and I have been putting together
a present for you.

1503
01:58:22,675 --> 01:58:24,635
Six-hundred and thirty-four.

1504
01:58:25,094 --> 01:58:26,679
They're signed, every one.

1505
01:58:27,596 --> 01:58:28,973
Holy shit.

1506
01:58:29,181 --> 01:58:31,892
Now, don't go
getting jealous, Theresa.

1507
01:58:32,143 --> 01:58:33,728
We have something for you.

1508
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:37,523
Internal PG&E documents,
all about the contamination.

1509
01:58:37,773 --> 01:58:39,483
The one I like best says...

1510
01:58:39,734 --> 01:58:43,529
...l'm paraphrasing here, but it says,
"The water's poisonous...

1511
01:58:43,779 --> 01:58:47,366
...but it's best if this wasn't
discussed with the neighbours."

1512
01:58:47,617 --> 01:58:50,077
It's to Hinkley
from PG&E headquarters.

1513
01:58:50,328 --> 01:58:53,122
Stamp received March 1966.

1514
01:58:57,501 --> 01:58:59,086
How did you do this?

1515
01:59:00,546 --> 01:59:03,841
Seeing as how I have no
brains or legal expertise...

1516
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:06,010
...and Ed was losing all faith.

1517
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:07,803
Completely. No faith.

1518
01:59:08,054 --> 01:59:12,850
I went out there and performed sexual
favours. 634 blowjobs in five days.

1519
01:59:19,607 --> 01:59:21,525
I'm really quite tired.

1520
01:59:22,234 --> 01:59:23,611
Oh, thank you.

1521
01:59:49,971 --> 01:59:52,014
Why did you want me to come?

1522
01:59:53,641 --> 01:59:56,352
I wanna show you
what you helped to do.

1523
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:25,965
- How are you feeling today?
- Good.

1524
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,968
- It's a good day.
- Oh, I'm glad.

1525
02:00:29,468 --> 02:00:31,178
Well, come on in.

1526
02:00:31,971 --> 02:00:34,598
What a nice surprise this is.

1527
02:00:37,184 --> 02:00:38,227
Donna.

1528
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:46,444
I wanted to come out here
instead of calling...

1529
02:00:46,694 --> 02:00:49,739
...because the judge
came back with a number.

1530
02:00:56,579 --> 02:01:00,958
For the whole group, or for us?

1531
02:01:01,709 --> 02:01:03,085
Both.

1532
02:01:04,337 --> 02:01:08,924
He's gonna make them pay 333 million.

1533
02:01:12,887 --> 02:01:15,097
- And...
- Oh, my God.

1534
02:01:17,516 --> 02:01:21,020
He's gonna make them give
5 million of that to your family.

1535
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,273
Five million dollars?

1536
02:01:24,565 --> 02:01:26,233
Five million dollars.

1537
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:32,698
I don't even know
how much money that is.

1538
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:37,745
Well, it's enough. It's enough
for whatever you could ever need...

1539
02:01:37,995 --> 02:01:43,125
...or what your girls need, or your
girls' girls. It'll be enough.

1540
02:01:43,376 --> 02:01:46,504
Oh, Erin. Oh, God.

1541
02:01:49,048 --> 02:01:51,676
Thank you so much.

1542
02:01:55,262 --> 02:01:56,681
It's okay.

1543
02:02:01,602 --> 02:02:04,105
I don't know what I'd have done
without you.

1544
02:02:05,273 --> 02:02:06,899
It's a good day.

1545
02:02:07,942 --> 02:02:10,444
This is too much.

1546
02:02:21,122 --> 02:02:24,834
Masry and Vititoe, can I...?
Shoot!

1547
02:02:28,462 --> 02:02:30,172
Delivery for Ed Masry.

1548
02:02:30,423 --> 02:02:33,009
Last office down the corridor,
on the right.

1549
02:02:33,259 --> 02:02:34,635
Thank you.

1550
02:02:34,885 --> 02:02:36,637
Masry and Vititoe...

1551
02:02:36,846 --> 02:02:37,888
Damn it!

1552
02:02:38,097 --> 02:02:41,517
Does anyone know anything
about these phones?

1553
02:02:46,147 --> 02:02:48,691
Everybody loves the desk...

1554
02:02:48,941 --> 02:02:51,527
...you picked out for me.
It's great.

1555
02:02:52,486 --> 02:02:56,115
Guess who's on the cover
of <i>Los Angeles Lawyer</i> magazine?

1556
02:02:56,365 --> 02:02:58,367
Talk to you later, baby. Bye.

1557
02:03:03,289 --> 02:03:04,874
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1558
02:03:19,847 --> 02:03:23,434
I'd rather walk her through this
in person, to show her...

1559
02:03:23,643 --> 02:03:26,395
...visual aids, documents and stuff.

1560
02:03:26,646 --> 02:03:29,899
Tell her I won't take up
too much of her time.

1561
02:03:33,945 --> 02:03:37,615
It's a little more complicated
than Hinkley, so let me do that.

1562
02:03:39,784 --> 02:03:42,036
Say I'm not a lawyer.
That may help.

1563
02:03:43,079 --> 02:03:44,121
Great.

1564
02:03:44,372 --> 02:03:47,833
Why don't you give me the address now?
Just in case.

1565
02:03:52,088 --> 02:03:55,549
All right. Thanks so much. Bye.

1566
02:03:55,841 --> 02:03:57,259
What's up?

1567
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:00,680
I have your bonus check.

1568
02:04:04,517 --> 02:04:06,352
I want you to be prepared.

1569
02:04:08,771 --> 02:04:11,357
The figure's not exactly
what we discussed.

1570
02:04:15,236 --> 02:04:16,779
Why not?

1571
02:04:16,988 --> 02:04:20,866
Because, after careful consideration,
I felt...

1572
02:04:22,076 --> 02:04:25,288
...that figure was not appropriate.

1573
02:04:26,914 --> 02:04:28,708
Although you may not agree...

1574
02:04:29,625 --> 02:04:31,377
...you have to trust my...

1575
02:04:31,836 --> 02:04:34,380
Trust? You want me to trust you?

1576
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:37,383
Don't use big words
you don't understand.

1577
02:04:37,842 --> 02:04:40,553
- It's a complicated issue...
- I did a job.

1578
02:04:40,803 --> 02:04:43,973
You should reward me accordingly.
It's not complicated.

1579
02:04:44,223 --> 02:04:48,728
All you lawyers do is complicate
situations that aren't complicated.

1580
02:04:49,103 --> 02:04:52,064
Do you know why people think
lawyers are scumbags?

1581
02:04:52,273 --> 02:04:55,818
Because they are. I can't believe
you're doing this to me...

1582
02:04:56,027 --> 02:04:58,237
...when I'm up to my ass
in Kettleman plaintiffs...

1583
02:04:58,446 --> 02:05:00,990
...which looks to be
double the amount of Hinkley.

1584
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:05,536
You expect me to leave my kids
with strangers, knock on doors...

1585
02:05:05,745 --> 02:05:08,539
...get these people to trust you,
and you're screwing me!

1586
02:05:10,416 --> 02:05:13,085
I want you to know,
it's not about the number!

1587
02:05:13,336 --> 02:05:15,630
It is about the way
my work is valued.

1588
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:18,549
No matter what I do, you're not...

1589
02:05:23,846 --> 02:05:25,640
As I was saying...

1590
02:05:26,432 --> 02:05:30,853
...I decided that the figure
you proposed...

1591
02:05:31,103 --> 02:05:33,564
...was inappropriate.

1592
02:05:33,773 --> 02:05:35,107
So I increased it.

1593
02:05:46,327 --> 02:05:49,872
Do they teach beauty queens
how to apologize?

1594
02:05:50,122 --> 02:05:52,959
Because you suck at it.
