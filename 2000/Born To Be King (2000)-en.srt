3
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,292
Nam...

4
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,251
What are you doing?

5
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:01,709
Nam...

6
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,917
Nam...

7
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:16,042
Nam...my memory comes back.

8
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,417
What happened?

9
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,084
Nothing.

10
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:19,084
I make this breakfast especially for you.

11
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,084
See, Chinese style, Western style.

12
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,917
Want any strawberry jam?

13
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:25,167
You want me to buy you something?

14
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,709
I want to have a baby!

15
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,709
Are you serious?

16
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:41,417
But we have to get married first.

17
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,501
Ask grandma!

18
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,626
No, she always mistakes me for Smartie.

19
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,709
By the way...

20
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,084
Comparing Smartie with me...

21
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,292
Who is more attractive?

22
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,751
Is she more lovely?

23
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,042
Or, am I more elegant?

24
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:18,251
Or, my character is better than hers?
She has a bad temper.

25
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,876
Or, I look more like a lady.

26
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,542
And she looks more like a rascal?

27
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,334
Overall, who is better?

28
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,584
You really want to know?

29
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,584
Tell me!

30
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,251
Go ask her in the underworld.

31
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,376
Don't ask me these kind of questions.

32
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,209
Democratic Progressive Party's candidate
Chen Shui Bian has swept a victory.

33
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,292
Defeated Nationalist Party's Lien Chen

34
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,459
and independent James Soong
with nearly 5 million votes,

35
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,417
becoming the new leader of Taiwan.

36
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,167
Taiwan department of
the Communist Party's Central Committee

37
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:55,501
and The State Council's Taiwan Office
issued a statement

38
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:59,126
reiterating that the result of
the recent election cannot change the fact

39
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,709
that Taiwan is a part of China,

40
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,834
and warn that China will not tolerate
any form of "Taiwan independence".

41
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,792
To judge the new leader of Taiwan...

42
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,751
Just came back from Taiwan?

43
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:12,334
Yes, the presidential election was finished.

44
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,042
It is none of your business.

45
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:17,501
Cousin and I joined the election campaign.

46
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,376
Really?

47
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,042
Chicken, which team did you support?

48
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:22,959
Lian Zhan, Chen Shui Bian,
or French soccer team?

49
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,751
San Luen Gang used to
support the Nationalist Party.

50
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,626
We thought our candidate would win, but...

51
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:32,292
He lost big. What can I do?

52
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,209
It is always true, the winner is the king.

53
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,876
No fun, so I came back. Play something else.

54
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:38,917
Like what?

55
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,626
Marriage.

56
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,292
Are you serious?

57
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,626
Of course, I don't want to though.

58
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,126
A political deal!

59
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,584
Who is the youngest in San Luen Gang? Me.

60
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,876
Who is the most handsome? Me.

61
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:55,876
But, you are used to fooling around with girls.

62
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,417
What is her name?

63
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,584
Kusakari Nanako!

64
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:02,167
Nanako? Is she the girl in the porno VCDs?

65
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,709
The one moaning so loud?

66
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,751
No, that one is the famous cook, Ms. Fong.

67
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,584
Chicken, you can't speak Japanese.

68
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,501
How can you communicate with your wife?

69
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,292
We use body language.

70
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:16,917
How...

71
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,751
How to communicate with her?

72
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,042
It is simple. You know.

73
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:25,626
In fact, her father is Kusakari Ichio.

74
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,584
He is...

75
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,501
the fifth generation chief
of Yamada Gang in Japan.

76
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,084
The fifth evolution?

77
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,626
No way...what does it mean?

78
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,834
He is the fifth generation leader in the Gang.

79
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,209
San Luen Gang assigns me

80
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,001
to marry his daughter.

81
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:41,959
An arranged marriage?

82
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,334
Marriage of convenience?

83
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:46,042
If it is true, we will all go to Japan
for your wedding.

84
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,167
Great, let's go now.

85
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,084
But you have to stay here.

86
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,959
I need to make a trip to Japan.

87
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,209
Willi, make an appointment
with Mr. Chiang for me.

88
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,209
Yes.

89
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,501
Chicken.

90
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,626
This is uncle Hing's son.

91
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,917
Brother Chicken. Willi.

92
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,167
He studies law.

93
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:01,334
Is it boring?

94
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:04,626
Shaking hands is outdated.

95
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:09,876
Money back!

96
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,001
No way! In your face!

97
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,292
Bastard!

98
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:19,584
Stop fighting, boys!

99
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:21,334
Why does watching a soccer game
turn into a violent fight?

100
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,584
No sports spirit at all.

101
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,292
Who are you?

102
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,959
I am a priest.

103
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,876
But I love watching soccer games.

104
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,834
Don't make a mess here.

105
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,126
Get lost! Jesus Christ!

106
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,792
What's wrong? A duel or what?

107
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,751
Brother Peel, you saw what they did.

108
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,959
They make trouble here.

109
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,084
Hey, weird heads.

110
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,334
We are all from the same gang.

111
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,626
We shouldn't fight against each other.

112
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,584
Brother Big Head, I give you face.

113
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:53,792
Oh really? You give me face.

114
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,292
Come on! Fight with me?

115
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,334
Scared?

116
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,876
Who is your boss?

117
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,167
Tai Fei.

118
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,417
And you?

119
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:05,667
Hon.

120
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,667
Don't be mad. Just call their bosses.

121
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,042
Talk to their bosses.

122
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,334
Thanks for reminding me.

123
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,251
Please don't...

124
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,334
I was quite drunk, so I said stupid things.

125
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,126
Sorry...

126
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:16,959
Well...

127
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,126
No next time, really...

128
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,584
Sounds polite?

129
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,584
Only dogs wear this kind of choker.

130
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,001
- All right?
- Okay.

131
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:28,334
Then shake hands and be friends.

132
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,459
All right? Go back to your seats to watch the game.

133
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,251
To dance, go...

134
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,376
Let's have fun, be happy.

135
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,376
It is settled, dances.

136
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,709
Let's have a drink.

137
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,667
Want a young girl to keep you company?

138
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,876
Nowadays, the young are badly behaved.

139
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,542
So, I get you a girl to listen to your lecture.

140
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,751
Priest, sit down and relax.

141
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:54,334
Give me some whisky.

142
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:58,209
By the way, Nam, Chicken...

143
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,292
You should lecture your men.

144
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,584
They have no respect to anyone at all.

145
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:03,792
They fight against one another.

146
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,167
Priest, what do you think?

147
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,959
Would Royal Madrid win this year?

148
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,626
Probably.

149
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:16,876
My dad adores Nanako.

150
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,292
This wedding joins Yamada Gang
and San Luen Gang together.

151
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:25,751
San Luen Gang's Lui and
other senior lieutenants have arrived.

152
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,167
Mr. Chiang from Hong Kong

153
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,501
and other Hung Hing leaders
have already arrived.

154
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,459
He speaks Cantonese.

155
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,459
Director Kusakari is my foster-father.

156
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:39,001
I am Chinese.

157
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,667
I see.

158
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,584
I have seen many Japanese TV soap operas.

159
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,751
I love Tokyo the most.

160
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,251
Tourists from Hong Kong
and Taiwan come to Tokyo...

161
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,084
Like to visit the Rainbow Bridge.

162
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:53,751
Yes! Rainbow Bridge!

163
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:57,376
Go with me.

164
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,667
- Thirteen Sister!
- Brother Black!

165
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,376
Mr. Chiang.

166
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,042
How are you doing?

167
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,709
This is one of the senior leaders
in Yamada Gang.

168
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,584
Where is Chicken?

169
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,001
Japanese-style wedding is very complicated.

170
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,667
Too many rituals, how can he find time?

171
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,834
I want to see his wife?

172
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,334
His wife...

173
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,751
Looks like an AV girl,
her look sexually arouses me.

174
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,792
How rude?

175
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,834
The Japanese don't understand
what I am talking about.

176
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,834
Yes! Yes! Yes!

177
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,251
Black!

178
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,959
Come say hello to Lui.

179
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,876
You are the son of San Luen Gang's chief?

180
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,167
A big boy now.

181
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,251
You came all the way for the wedding?

182
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:18,917
I just came back from the U.S.

183
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,501
I heard Chicken is getting married,

184
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,334
so I asked Kam to bring me here.

185
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,417
This is Michael, my friend from the States.

186
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,667
How do you do, man?

187
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:28,876
Man...

188
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,209
I am on vacation, so join in.

189
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,084
Are you Cantonese?

190
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,376
I am from Hong Kong.

191
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:36,667
Please come...

192
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,834
This is Mr. Chiang.

193
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,751
We met last time in Thailand,

194
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,876
and had shark fin soups in Chinatown.

195
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,042
Lui senior's son
just graduated from the States.

196
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,792
He is your junior.

197
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,917
Mr. Chiang, chief of Hong Kong's Hung Hing Gang.

198
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,376
You are a big-name.

199
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,709
Nice to meet you.

200
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,667
Great!

201
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,876
Smart, have potential.

202
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,709
So handsome, must be popular with girls.

203
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,084
Sorry?

204
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,417
Popular with girls.

205
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,417
You must be Thirteen Sister from Hung Hing Gang.

206
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,251
Right! Right! Exactly...

207
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:12,792
Where is Ho Nam?

208
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,459
He is here.

209
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,167
Come over here.

210
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,167
"Marriage Vow"

211
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,042
I solemnly declare...

212
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,667
On this wedding date.

213
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,167
From today,

214
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:13,917
we must respect and love each other...

215
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,167
From a family.

216
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,084
Share our sweetness and bitterness.

217
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:36,167
Forever.

218
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,126
May we

219
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,376
be blessed forever.

220
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:51,209
Together we make a solemn pledge.

221
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,876
In this year...

222
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:59,751
1 - April

223
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,584
Husband, Chiu Shan Ho.

224
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,792
Wife, Kusakari Nanako.

225
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,167
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.

226
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:25,667
Today is my daughter's wedding.

227
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,834
I am appreciative of your attendance,

228
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,959
coming all the way for her wedding.

229
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,751
I am deeply grateful! Thank you!

230
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,334
Mr. Chiang, after the ceremony

231
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:05,417
We should sit down and talk about business.

232
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:07,876
Now, we are one big family.

233
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:11,417
We should communicate more with each other.

234
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,501
The cutting of your suit looks funny.

235
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,959
Like a flying cockroach.

236
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,459
Behave...take a picture, quick.

237
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,709
Chan Ho Nam.

238
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,792
Lui senior's son.

239
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,917
Nice to meet you!

240
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,959
This is Kam, the think-tank of San Luen Gang.

241
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,584
How are you?

242
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:35,751
Kam and Brave are our most senior lieutenants.

243
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:36,876
Glad to finally meet you!

244
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,959
Nice to meet you.

245
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,209
Before, Chicken is kind
of half-Hongkonger and half-Taiwanese.

246
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,126
Now, he becomes one-third Hongkonger,

247
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,501
one-third Taiwanese,

248
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:45,834
and one-third Japanese.

249
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,292
Absolutely right.

250
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,084
Like an all-purpose clip?

251
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,834
The bride's hairdo is pretty, like a fountain.

252
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,292
Let's take a picture.

253
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:59,292
Mr. Hidari, thanks for coming!

254
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:02,626
This is my son-in-law, Mr. Chicken.

255
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,584
How do you do?

256
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,501
Good afternoon.

257
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,292
I like Japanese style weddings.

258
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,542
Me too. Her skin is white as snow.

259
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:10,834
I wish I could try one more time.

260
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,167
Then get a divorce and get married again.

261
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,292
- Sure.
- No way!

262
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,501
Once is more than enough.

263
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,084
When is your turn?

264
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,459
When?

265
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,709
What?

266
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,084
As a married man,
you shouldn't fool around anymore.

267
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,959
Today is my happy wedding, don't say bad things.

268
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,334
- About fooling around...
- Tell them...

269
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,376
- I am an expert.
- Right...

270
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:32,667
I am a local here in Tokyo.

271
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,792
- Really?
- Yes.

272
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,376
I'll show you some great places tonight.

273
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:36,042
For what?

274
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:39,167
First, we try the Turkey...

275
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:40,751
Turkish Bath, right?

276
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,417
Yes! Then, we play dices...

277
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:44,751
Dice?

278
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,376
Let's take a picture!

279
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,709
Finally, we are at Rainbow Bridge!

280
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,709
Isn't it romantic?

281
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,709
Romantic? Look at yourself!

282
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,709
Look over there, it is not romantic!

283
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,626
Just like the Ching Ma Bridge in Hong Kong.

284
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:11,584
Did you know,
many Japanese soap operas are filmed here?

285
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:12,751
Like famous actress Takako Matsu...

286
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,584
I know. I saw it before.

287
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,251
Many couples make a pledge here. You know?

288
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:22,626
Also, men propose to women...

289
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:27,126
Here they propose to women at this place.

290
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:29,334
If someone proposes to me now,

291
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,376
I will certainly say yes.

292
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:51,042
What is it?

293
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,709
Ho Nam's career...

294
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:13,417
Ho Nam's love...

295
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,542
Please.

296
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,667
Ho Nam's career...

297
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,167
Good luck!

298
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,001
Good fortune!

299
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:28,834
Will he marry me?

300
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,542
"Number 54 - bad luck"

301
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,584
No way, it won't be true.

302
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,334
What's wrong?

303
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,376
Nothing. Let's go.

304
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,501
What is that?

305
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:16,667
See for yourself.

306
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,667
Not bad.

307
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,709
You understand what it means?

308
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:26,626
No.

309
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,667
Nice to have all of you here.

310
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,334
Cheers...

311
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,751
Chicken...

312
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:44,626
Even after he got married...

313
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,292
He still fools around.

314
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:49,709
Why?

315
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,959
Because his cousin, me, likes to fool around.
So, he likes it.

316
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,167
Like you.

317
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:56,084
Of course. Cheers!

318
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,751
Cheers...

319
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:01,667
Right, brother Hon.

320
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,667
What kind of restaurant is hot in Japan?
We can open one in Hong Kong.

321
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,834
We are considering to do so.

322
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,334
I'll think of a name for your restaurant.

323
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,542
Gosh, I am hungry.

324
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,501
Call it "Hungry Man".

325
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,376
Great!

326
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:16,667
Name it after Japanese stars,
like Takuya Kimura or Sorimachi Takashi.

327
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,167
Takuya Kimura again!

328
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:19,334
Forget it!

329
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:21,376
Your English name is Philip, and yours is May.

330
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,709
Putting together, sound like "Filipino Maid"

331
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,626
Right, then call it "Filipino Maid Restaurant".

332
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:28,084
Cheers!

333
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,376
Everybody.

334
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,792
To celebrate the homecoming of
the son of San Luen Gang's chief.

335
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,292
Back from the U.S.

336
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,126
Let's cheers!

337
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,959
Brother Black, it is okay!

338
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:42,584
All of them are high-ranking leaders
of Hung Hing Gang.

339
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:45,417
You are their junior and
should pay respect to them.

340
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:46,959
Bring your glass.

341
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,751
Come on, cheers...

342
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,792
Cheers...

343
00:21:56,751 --> 00:22:00,959
For our new president Chen Shui Bian.

344
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,626
- Cheers.
- Again?

345
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:05,334
But it is nothing to do with the new president.

346
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:06,959
Of course, it is related to him.

347
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,167
Chen Shui Bian will inaugurate on May 20th.

348
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,292
He will present his inauguration address.

349
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,542
If he provokes China...

350
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,459
China will certainly bomb us.

351
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,959
Would it pass through Hong Kong first?

352
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,917
It depends.

353
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,626
The bombs fly really fast.

354
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:22,501
Who knows?

355
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:26,001
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight!

356
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,834
Look at me.

357
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,209
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight

358
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,876
"Life..."

359
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,834
"Is like the waves in the wild seas."

360
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,626
"Sometimes it is vigorous,
sometimes it is tranquil."

361
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,667
"My dear friends, take care."

362
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,751
"In our lives,"

363
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:48,626
"even the poorest may have their day."

364
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:51,417
"No complaint."

365
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,084
"It is life."

366
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,876
Damned Taiwanese!

367
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,667
What the hell is he singing?

368
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,584
"A glass of wine, some changes..."

369
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,334
They know nothing but fighting
for independence from China.

370
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:01,001
"Come at midnight."

371
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,667
"Get sentimental."

372
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,417
"I am the number one in the world!"

373
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,876
Damn you!

374
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:17,417
Don't fight...

375
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,751
We are all Chinese. Stop...

376
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:20,292
We are Chinese, but you are not.

377
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,542
You are Hongkongers and Taiwanese...

378
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,709
Don't be so cocky!

379
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,751
Why do the Chinese fight against each other?

380
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,667
Who knows? What a show!

381
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,292
Hit him! Damn!

382
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:35,501
Should we help?

383
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:37,542
We can't do anything.

384
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,876
What's up? Having a party?

385
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:45,126
Has just opened fire: Beijing vs Taiwan.

386
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,626
Stop!

387
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:54,876
What's wrong? Today is my wedding day.

388
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,084
I know.

389
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,626
The Beijingese incite the fight.

390
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,251
- Sorry.
- What?

391
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,251
- Wait.
- What?

392
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:02,542
Calm down.

393
00:24:07,084 --> 00:24:08,751
Yamada Gang...

394
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:12,834
Isn't it good enough?

395
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,126
All right?

396
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,667
It is my treat tonight.

397
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,209
Sit down.

398
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:27,834
So?

399
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,376
My wife slept.

400
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:32,209
Great!

401
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,626
Let's have some fun tonight.

402
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:35,709
First, get a Turkish bath.

403
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:36,792
What is the girl's name?

404
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,084
- Like the cartoon girl, Maruko.
- Maruko?

405
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:39,542
Or, the hot babe, Noriko Sakai.

406
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,292
Noriko Sakai? But you can't go.

407
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,709
No way! I'll go with you!

408
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,417
Let's go together...

409
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,709
Under the leadership of Mr. Chiang.

410
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:54,376
Hung Hing's business is
well-established across Asia.

411
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,417
It's a big success.

412
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,667
I am interested in doing business with you.

413
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,334
With the power of Yamada Gang in Japan,

414
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,459
plus the power of Taiwan's San Luen Gang,

415
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,376
and Hong Kong's Hung Hing Gang,

416
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,792
we join force and form alliance.

417
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,292
Absolutely, it will become a dream team.

418
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,501
In fact, Hung Hing Gang.

419
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:24,501
Glad to cooperate with Yamada Gang.

420
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,584
But, I decided to retire.

421
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:35,667
Sit back and relax in Thailand.

422
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:39,376
So, I decided...

423
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:42,459
to pass all the Hung Hing business

424
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,584
to Chan Ho Nam.

425
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,751
Director Kusakari, for any future business plan.

426
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:53,126
You can directly contact Ho Nam.

427
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:56,126
Yes.

428
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,667
The 21st century is the age of the young.

429
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,459
I agree.

430
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:07,584
I'm also considering retiring and enjoying life.

431
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:13,417
Listen, Chicken.

432
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,709
After my retirement...

433
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,792
Could you come to Japan
to take care of my business?

434
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:22,167
Yes!

435
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,542
Yes!

436
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,084
Take time to think about it.

437
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:31,334
Go back to Taiwan and give it some thought.

438
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:33,876
I will wait for your good news.

439
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:39,584
I heard

440
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,917
that Hung Hing members are great fighters.

441
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,959
Fighting is their routine.

442
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,376
Kind of.

443
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,959
How about a friendly sword fight?

444
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:53,334
Teach them a lesson.

445
00:26:56,334 --> 00:27:01,126
Sword fighting is
a traditional Japanese martial arts.

446
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:03,751
Each type has its own way of breathing.

447
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,376
Rituals, action, and movement.

448
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,417
Taoism is a way of living and thinking.

449
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:15,542
It requires hard work and long-term commitment.

450
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:58,584
I don't quite understand.

451
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,959
Since Lui senior passed away,

452
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:57,834
Black Dragon Gang have been against us.

453
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,459
They want to destroy us.

454
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,667
Now you are back.

455
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,167
I should give the chief position back to you

456
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,751
to avoid suspicion.

457
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:07,459
I am not that kind of ambitious person!

458
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,292
Although my father founded San Luen Gang,

459
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,959
it is not necessary for the Lui to be his heir.

460
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,584
Most importantly...

461
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:17,667
I don't want to be dragged
into triad power struggle.

462
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,167
Mr. Lui.

463
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,667
Gang's operation is very different
from the old days.

464
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:26,126
Your father

465
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:29,501
led us to develop a successful
and legal business,

466
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,542
like this golf mansion...

467
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,917
Today, the business is
well-established and prosperous.

468
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:38,167
It is natural to hand it down
from father to son.

469
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,751
You are the best person to take his place.

470
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:43,251
In year 2000

471
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:46,167
people talk about democracy and freedom.

472
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,792
Even our president is elected by popular vote.

473
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:52,167
As for the position of gang chief,

474
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,542
I think it should be given to a capable man.

475
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:58,084
Mr. Lui, you are right.

476
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:01,334
Our chief should be voted democratically.

477
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:03,167
One person, one vote?

478
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:04,292
I Object!

479
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,792
What do you object to?

480
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:09,709
Mr. Lui, since you came back,

481
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:10,959
no matter what,

482
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,917
I will pass the seat to you.

483
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:17,084
Maybe we should go back
and give it some thoughts,

484
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,376
Whether we can recommend an able man.

485
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:26,042
Brave and Kam...

486
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:29,542
Are the most senior lieutenants
in San Luen Gang.

487
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:32,167
Kam can take the place.

488
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,084
Absolutely not!

489
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,542
I can offer good advice, but not a good leader.

490
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,709
And offer recommendation from my experiences

491
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,876
Absolutely...

492
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,917
I can't be the gangster chief.

493
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,334
Panther unit head, any suggestion?

494
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,834
I have a great person in mind.

495
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,292
Share with us.

496
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:56,251
Chicken is the unit head of Poisonous Snake.

497
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,917
He has contributed a lot
to the success of our gang.

498
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,084
Also, he is the son-in-law of Yamada Gang chief.

499
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:07,501
If he becomes the chief of San Luen Gang

500
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,209
and these two gangs unite,

501
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:11,417
they will become the largest gang in Asia.

502
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,667
Objection!

503
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,959
Chicken is an outstanding unit head.

504
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,876
But he is from Hong Kong, not Taiwan.

505
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:22,167
How can he lead San Luen Gang?

506
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:24,459
Most of its units are formed by the Taiwanese.

507
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:27,042
Why not? As long as he is San Luen Gang member.

508
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,917
And is competent and has gut,

509
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,126
regardless of his nationalities.

510
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:32,251
I disagree!

511
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,417
Then what?

512
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:36,667
We Taiwanese have our own traditions.

513
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,751
- He can't even speak our dialects,
- What he can do?

514
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,001
how can he lead us?

515
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,542
- How can he think like us?
- He said

516
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,501
you can't speak Taiwan dialects.

517
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,292
And unqualified to be the chief.

518
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,042
Understand?

519
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:51,167
Some say ex-president Lee Teng Hui is Japanese.

520
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,709
But he could be the president.

521
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,542
Why can't Chicken be the chief?

522
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,876
You must be kidding.

523
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,751
Although I am Taiwanese,

524
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,126
I left Taiwan at 12 for studying in the US.

525
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:04,126
In terms of knowledge of Taiwan society

526
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:06,792
and gang operation, Chicken knows better than I.

527
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,376
Chicken, what do you think?

528
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:13,459
I appreciate your praise.

529
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:17,667
In fact, I have never dreamt of
being the gang chief.

530
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,667
Don't be too humble!

531
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:26,084
Whether I am a Taiwanese or speak local dialect

532
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:28,001
is not important.

533
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:31,417
Capability, open mind,

534
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,417
and long-term vision

535
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:35,876
are the most important attributes.

536
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,542
No more nonsense! I object!

537
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,334
Absolutely, I object!

538
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,459
What is your point?

539
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,917
Objection! Objection!

540
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,959
What do you actually object to?

541
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,501
You appeared to be loyal.

542
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,959
You want to be the chief!

543
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:50,126
- Nonsense!
- I am not!

544
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:52,959
I have said it loud and clear,
I don't want to be the chief.

545
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,834
Absolutely not!

546
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,126
Hypocrite!

547
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:59,334
We can read your mind.

548
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:01,417
You want to be the chief!

549
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:02,501
You want to pick a fight!

550
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:04,376
So what?

551
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,042
Anything else to say?

552
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:07,209
If you want to fight, I am ready!

553
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:09,292
Come! I am not scared of you!

554
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,001
All right! Stop!

555
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:15,751
What a joke!

556
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,709
In fact, we all understand.

557
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,709
Yes, this is true.

558
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:35,001
What is it?

559
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:35,959
Yes.

560
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:39,667
Garlic?

561
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,376
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

562
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,876
Can we eat now?

563
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,751
It's enough. Sit down to have a dinner.

564
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:54,584
Yes.

565
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,417
Yes...

566
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,334
- It is okay...
- Yes!

567
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,251
- You don't need to...
- Yes!

568
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,042
Do you understand me?

569
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,126
Yes! Yes!

570
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:13,917
Yes!

571
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:17,084
- No!
- Yes!

572
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,417
No...yes!

573
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:22,376
No...yes!

574
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,834
Yes...Eat...

575
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:25,959
Yes!

576
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:28,751
Yes!

577
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,251
After dinner...

578
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:33,751
Yes

579
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,792
Eat...

580
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,501
As your wife, it is my duty.

581
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,042
- Eat...
- Yes!

582
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,001
A macho man sits this way.

583
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,501
Good night.

584
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:54,501
Good...night

585
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:55,792
Good afternoon.

586
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:59,084
Good...afternoon.

587
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:00,376
Good morning.

588
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:02,917
Good...morning.

589
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,334
Work hard.

590
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,459
Work...hard.

591
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,459
Stop...

592
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:12,751
Yes!

593
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:14,542
Stop? Yes?

594
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:15,542
Yes...

595
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,709
Faster...

596
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:37,209
Stop!

597
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:40,917
Faster!

598
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:48,959
Stop!

599
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,001
With my wife...

600
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,126
Seems like a stranger.

601
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:04,292
With other women...

602
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,542
No...

603
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,334
What is missing?

604
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,126
Passion.

605
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:24,834
Next time...I should be more passionate.

606
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:29,709
Stop...Faster...

607
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,001
Hello?

608
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:37,501
Something happened.

609
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:38,959
Lui was attacked.

610
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,334
Really?

611
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:42,251
He is now in the hospital.

612
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,542
I'll come right away.

613
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:45,626
- You'd better now.
- Why?

614
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:48,626
Rumors say you eye is on the chief position.

615
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,251
So, you hired a hit man to kill him.

616
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,626
Bullshit!

617
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,042
If you show up, you will be in danger.

618
00:36:54,251 --> 00:36:57,209
If I don't go, I look more suspicious.

619
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:05,501
Chicken, how dare you come here?

620
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:06,501
Why not?

621
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:08,417
Some people say you plotted the assassination.

622
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,501
Bullshit!

623
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:11,709
Stupid!

624
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,292
Why would he kill him? What for?

625
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,792
Show me your evidence!

626
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,167
Nonsense!

627
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:37,959
You bastard!

628
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:41,417
You are bitter, so you hit him on the back.

629
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,876
A conspiracy to take over his place.

630
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:44,667
Nonsense!

631
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:47,584
He said you plotted the assassination.

632
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:49,042
Damn you!

633
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:50,334
You accuse me!

634
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,417
Lui and I are good friends.

635
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,417
He came all the way from the States
to attend my wedding in Japan.

636
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:56,417
So what?

637
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,959
If I would ever hire a hit man,
you would be my first target!

638
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,959
Shut up!

639
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,042
We are on the same boat!

640
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,334
Mr. Lui wants to see Chicken, Brave comes in.

641
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:18,209
Take care.

642
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,167
Damn you!

643
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,209
What the hell?

644
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:27,792
I swear, I didn't do it.

645
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:30,917
Or I would be punished brutally.

646
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,542
I trust you.

647
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:37,709
Yeah, a convicted criminal is caught red-handed,

648
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,417
but he still says he is innocent

649
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,709
Mr. Lui, you must have a thorough investigation.

650
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,251
You can't trust him.

651
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:46,209
Of course, I will probe into the case.

652
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,542
But you all should calm down.

653
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,251
There may be some misunderstandings.

654
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:54,001
I don't want to see
any power struggle within our gang.

655
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:57,209
Otherwise, outsiders will take advantage of us.

656
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,751
Especially Black Dragon Gang.

657
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:02,626
Their chief, Dragon, is highly suspicious.

658
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:04,334
To tell you honestly,

659
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,126
I have no doubt about Chicken's integrity.

660
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:11,542
Brave, I know you suspect Chicken.

661
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:13,584
But until he is proven guilty,

662
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,209
you'd better leave him alone, all right?

663
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,917
All right, I'll keep my mouth shut!

664
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:23,876
But if I find any evidence against you,
you will be a dead man!

665
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,251
Come with me to a place.

666
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:30,251
Where?

667
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,709
To a very important meeting.

668
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,834
Lui should have attended the meeting on
behalf of San Luen Gang,

669
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,876
but he is in the hospital,

670
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,876
and Brave is too radical.

671
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,959
He may make a fool of himself.

672
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,917
So you are the best choice.

673
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:50,084
What kind of meeting is it?

674
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,584
Have you heard of Eagle?

675
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,542
Yes.

676
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,334
He was the real triad boss in Taiwan.

677
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,417
I thought he was retired.

678
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:07,417
People from both the government
and the triad give him face.

679
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,417
He calls the meeting.

680
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,251
What can you say?

681
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,376
Go to a rave party...

682
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:34,209
Make a mess!

683
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:35,959
Rave party!

684
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,626
Why do you have so many drugs?
Are you a drug dealer?

685
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:44,042
I told you, they're not mine.

686
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:48,459
Sin and Kay were high on drugs.

687
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:50,917
I drove them home.

688
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:53,751
Unexpectedly, we were stopped by the police.

689
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,584
I didn't realize they carried so many drugs.

690
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,876
Did you take any?

691
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,042
Don't you love me?

692
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:07,751
You don't love me! Don't trust me!

693
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:11,751
I have been living with you for three years.

694
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:15,209
Together with Ricky, Bobby and Lily.

695
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:19,001
I take care of them and clean up their mess.

696
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:22,834
But I have never complained at all.

697
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,209
Those are your dogs.

698
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:28,667
That's right!

699
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,917
Do you remember,
when I first came to Hong Kong...

700
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:35,917
I used counterfeit bills.

701
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:38,542
You came to bail me out at the police station.

702
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,876
Like this time.

703
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:42,709
Do you remember, we were on the highway...

704
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,501
I opened the sunroof...

705
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,584
and threw off the bills like this..."whew"

706
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,126
Flew like the wind.

707
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,001
Wasn't it romantic?

708
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,876
If I didn't come, you would feel
more romantic sitting in jail

709
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,042
I knew you would come.

710
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:00,709
Don't you kiss me?

711
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,459
You don't love me!

712
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:13,376
Hold me tight.

713
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:22,876
He is the chief of Black Dragon Gang?

714
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,334
Yes, when our chief was here,

715
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,584
he was just a small potato.

716
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:29,126
Look at him now...

717
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:34,626
Kam, long time no see.

718
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:37,126
Brother Dragon, how are you doing?

719
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:39,292
Let me introduce.

720
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,876
This is Dragon from Black Dragon Gang.

721
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,292
This is Chicken,
unit head of Poisonous Snake Sect.

722
00:42:45,584 --> 00:42:47,167
Chicken.

723
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:49,667
Your name is getting big in the past two years.

724
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,917
I heard you have become the son-in-law of

725
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,876
Kusakari Ichio, the chief of Yamada Gang.

726
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,501
What a pity! In San Luen Gang...

727
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,042
No one can barely succeed.

728
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,876
Brother Dragon, you are too direct.

729
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:11,667
Yet, I believe only coward dares
not to stay at San Luen Gang.

730
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,834
I heard you were Lui senior's assistant...

731
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,542
Running errands for him.

732
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,667
Lui's son is in hospital

733
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:26,126
And San Luen Gang is in chaos.

734
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:29,584
It is not because of you, right?

735
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:37,376
Long time no see.

736
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:39,542
Sit down...

737
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:40,917
Have some tea...

738
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,584
Make yourself comfortable.

739
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:46,959
I call this meeting to get together.

740
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,001
Since

741
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:54,084
the March 18 presidential election,

742
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:56,376
there have been lots of changes in society.

743
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:59,584
I think we should get together

744
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,834
and discuss

745
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:03,959
how to manage the changes.

746
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,084
I think

747
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,459
we should wait and see.

748
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:12,876
Whoever is the president or the ruling party

749
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,084
only cares for money.

750
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:20,459
Money can buy off god, political parties,

751
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:22,584
and even the president.

752
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:25,334
In the past,
we dealt with the Nationalist Party.

753
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:27,667
Now, we can do the same
to the Democratic Progressive Party.

754
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:31,876
But, the new president declares
an end to political corruption.

755
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:36,292
His first priority is

756
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:39,334
to establish a stable cross-strait relationship.

757
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,334
Then

758
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:44,667
he can deal with the triads.

759
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,209
To make peace with the triads

760
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:50,251
he needs our help.

761
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:56,459
Brother Eagle, what is your comment
on the new government policies?

762
00:44:57,209 --> 00:45:02,001
Political wisdom tells us

763
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:05,751
suppression or purge doesn't work.

764
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:08,834
Political wisdom tells...

765
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:10,334
We know.

766
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,459
Suppression or purge.

767
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,626
I believe the best way is...

768
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:30,501
I believe the best way is to "pacify".

769
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,792
Pacify?

770
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:33,792
What does it mean?

771
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,751
Like the ancient story about the 108 heroes.

772
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:40,709
They revolted against
the imperial court for years.

773
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,376
At the end, they complied with the emperor.

774
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,126
You meant...

775
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:50,667
Our government should transform
all triad members

776
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,084
into civil servants.

777
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:58,084
What is his theory?

778
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:00,292
Damn, I don't care.

779
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,751
It doesn't apply to the traids.

780
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:05,751
The means may be different,

781
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:07,876
but the end spirit is the same.

782
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:11,334
I guess they want us to cooperate

783
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:13,417
and under their control.

784
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:16,917
Then we can make profit as usual.

785
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:20,917
Anyway, just play by the rules.

786
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:27,084
The world is constantly changing.

787
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:33,209
We should go along with the trend.

788
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:40,209
Long live the president...

789
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:43,542
Upon the president's arrival,
supporters are extremely emotional.

790
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:46,167
This is his first speech since the election.

791
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:48,501
The crowds are hailing him.

792
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:52,584
From tonight onward,

793
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:59,084
the President, Vice President,
and the Democratic Progressive Party...

794
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:02,084
In the coalition meeting

795
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:05,917
we discussed about government's demand
for our cooperation.

796
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:08,376
To be pacified

797
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:12,251
Eagle implied that

798
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:16,751
we should reach a consensus and be pacified.

799
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:22,042
He even used an ancient story
to illustrate the case.

800
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,334
Damn it!

801
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:31,417
Brave, what do you think?

802
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:36,167
Brat, you want to quote me?

803
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:39,792
You are smart. Don't need to ask for my advice.

804
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,459
I am a stubborn old man.

805
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:50,084
You are a senior lieutenant in our gang.

806
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:54,167
Have a good grasp
of Taiwan's party politics and triads.

807
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:58,542
You were right last time.

808
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,126
Coming from Hong Kong, I am an outsider.

809
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:06,542
Unfamiliar with Taiwan's party
and gangster politics.

810
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:09,334
That's why I came to see you.

811
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,709
Trust me or not. Wholeheartedly...

812
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:17,459
I want to learn from you.

813
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:21,834
What did Kam say?

814
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,376
He didn't take any side.

815
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:31,876
He is smart.

816
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:35,167
How about you?

817
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:37,376
Of course, I oppose to pacification.

818
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:41,709
But the Democratic Progressive Party
declared to end corruption.

819
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,751
The old formula wouldn't work.

820
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:45,792
Are you stupid or what?

821
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,834
To end political collusion?

822
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:51,334
Nothing is absolute.

823
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:55,417
Before the election, the new president
always advocated independence.

824
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,876
But now, he doesn't mention it anymore.

825
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:01,292
Politicians always pay lip service.

826
00:49:01,292 --> 00:49:02,626
Don't trust their words.

827
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:05,959
It is all political nonsense.

828
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,584
You are insane.

829
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:10,584
Right.

830
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:21,084
The politicians take advantage of us.

831
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,417
They come to us for favors.

832
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:27,959
Otherwise, they don't want to see us.

833
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:31,126
They bad-mouth us.

834
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:34,751
Look down upon us, yell at us...

835
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:38,292
Just want to kick us out.

836
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:40,667
We can't be controlled by them.

837
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,126
If we are under their control,

838
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:45,126
we will be vanished sooner or later.
Understand?

839
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:46,459
Yes.

840
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:49,542
If we give in, we will lose power.

841
00:49:50,626 --> 00:49:54,126
Without power, we are like used a battery.

842
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:56,501
Ending up in the trash.

843
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:02,292
You look stupid, but you are quite smart.

844
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:08,084
Thanks for you.

845
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:19,542
Lui just came back from the US.

846
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:21,751
Not familiar with Taiwan's situations.

847
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:24,959
I should give him a thorough analysis.

848
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:30,001
All right, I am leaving.

849
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:32,292
Enjoy your fishing.

850
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,292
Chicken...

851
00:50:39,376 --> 00:50:40,376
I'm asking you

852
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:43,667
about Lui's attack.

853
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,167
Did you do it?

854
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,084
Damn...I have said it many times...

855
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:49,917
Don't get mad.

856
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:51,876
All right, go back...

857
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:56,959
Brave, I want to ask you a question.

858
00:50:57,376 --> 00:51:01,084
How do you become a real Taiwanese?

859
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:10,334
Learn to eat betel nut.

860
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:13,667
I tried it before.

861
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:17,334
It has a strange aftertaste.

862
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,334
My mouth stains with artificial red, like blood.

863
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:21,917
Then, how can I kiss girls?

864
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:26,292
You are a great unit leader.

865
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,001
But your weakness is too lustful

866
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:31,542
That's why I don't want to be the chief.

867
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,251
It will occupy too much of my time.

868
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:35,584
Then I won't have time to kiss,

869
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:38,292
to fool around with girls...

870
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:40,667
All right...bye

871
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,167
Don't tell me your juicy story.

872
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,209
All right!

873
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:49,751
It takes a lot of hard work to become a leader.

874
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:54,167
Like me, I was a chauffeur before.

875
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,334
But now, I am the unit head of Panther Sect.

876
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,084
Yes.

877
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,084
Work hard.

878
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:03,459
Let's go.

879
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:09,959
What did you talk about with the old man?

880
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:12,126
Anyway...

881
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:14,084
He is a stubborn old man.

882
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:16,751
But he is my senior, I have to respect him.

883
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:18,167
It depends.

884
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,042
Some old people are open, but some aren't.

885
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,126
Understand?

886
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:23,834
Your phone call.

887
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:26,792
Hello!

888
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:28,876
Chicken? This is Nanako.

889
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:31,959
Do you come home for dinner?

890
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:33,667
Dinner?

891
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:37,334
No home dinner.

892
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:41,042
You eat yourself...

893
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:42,917
Sleep yourself...

894
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:43,751
Yes.

895
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:45,001
Wait...

896
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:47,209
Goodbye.

897
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:50,417
What are you talking about?

898
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:53,709
A wife makes you speak English and Japanese.

899
00:52:53,709 --> 00:52:57,417
With one more,
you can speak French and Russian...

900
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:58,459
What a deal!

901
00:52:58,459 --> 00:53:02,334
Only do, no talk.

902
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:06,334
What's mean "only do, no talk"?

903
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:10,667
Cousin, tonight...

904
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:16,001
- You bastard.
- I'll bring you

905
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:18,834
to enjoy love and sex.

906
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:20,501
What is it?

907
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,501
A blue triangle.

908
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,417
Viagra.

909
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:27,084
Men's savior.

910
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:28,959
Is that right?

911
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,209
Yes.

912
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:31,917
Very powerful.

913
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,292
Only one pill can do...

914
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:36,334
Shoot high.

915
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:38,834
So potent.

916
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:39,834
I don't need it.

917
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:44,792
Why not? You can take half a pill...

918
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:45,959
Careful!

919
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:47,459
It hurts!

920
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:52,709
I'll show you a new hang-out tonight.

921
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,084
Don't take too many, it may kill you.

922
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:54,917
I am not kidding.

923
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:56,417
All right.

924
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,292
Come on. Have fun...

925
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,167
My dear, come over!

926
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:11,667
Cousin.

927
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:12,667
What?

928
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,417
After I got married, my hands get so stiff.

929
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:18,959
Is it a problem?

930
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:20,584
Of course.

931
00:54:20,584 --> 00:54:22,834
You need practice to soften your hands.

932
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:24,959
Be gentle...

933
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:27,167
Massage this one gently...and that one...

934
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,042
Feeling great.

935
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:32,084
Let me lie down...

936
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:33,709
Come over...

937
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:35,126
Not this way.

938
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:43,251
Show time.

939
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:35,834
Go!

940
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:49,792
Akira.

941
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:57,626
Please don't go.

942
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:11,459
What is the matter?

943
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:18,251
I miss you. So, I came here.

944
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:28,042
You knew I loved you!

945
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:32,959
I am married.

946
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:36,001
You should have married me!

947
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:39,959
That damned old man, he did me wrong!

948
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:29,001
Siu Mo...

949
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,209
Siu Mo!

950
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:53,417
Run!

951
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:56,751
Run!

952
00:57:58,167 --> 00:58:00,876
Hurry! Run!

953
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:04,542
Run!

954
00:58:52,334 --> 00:58:53,709
Chicken, get into the car!

955
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:03,834
Cousin...

956
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:11,917
Cousin!

957
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:21,626
Damn! You are all rubbish!

958
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,376
One dead, one ran away.

959
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:43,084
You traitor, go to hell!

960
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,667
Eat some more.

961
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,584
Don't go, I'm scared.

962
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:34,917
Bastard Akira.

963
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:37,959
I thought my father-in-law
would let his daughter marry him.

964
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:40,584
And succeed his place.

965
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:44,209
I ruined his plan.

966
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:46,542
He raped my wife.

967
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:52,209
How is she?

968
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:57,334
Getting better.

969
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,834
But she has nightmares every night.

970
01:03:09,376 --> 01:03:11,501
If I didn't go out that night...

971
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,209
You should stay home with her.

972
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:23,167
I don't have a home now.

973
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:28,959
He wants to nail you, you can't hide anywhere.

974
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:36,292
San Luen Gang back you up?

975
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:39,959
San Luen Gang?

976
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:45,084
Lui is in the hospital.

977
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:48,792
He has insisted on not getting
involved in gang affairs.

978
01:03:49,334 --> 01:03:52,584
Earlier, I had a fight with Brave.

979
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:57,001
Brave and Kam argue
over the new government policy.

980
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,459
They don't talk to each other.

981
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:02,501
Now, San Luen Gang is...

982
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:06,417
Like presidential election, in a big mess.

983
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:11,001
Anyway, we are always good brothers.

984
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:13,876
We help each other out.

985
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:21,876
Where is your girlfriend?

986
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:23,376
In Taipei.

987
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,542
Do you want her to keep your wife company?

988
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:27,917
No thanks.

989
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:37,917
I can solve my problems.

990
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:40,334
Come over...

991
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:50,751
This is Siu Mo, he worked for my cousin.

992
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:56,334
He helps me to hide out here.

993
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:00,209
Willi, call my contacts in Taiwan.

994
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,834
I am sorry. I went shopping and forgot the time.

995
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:38,501
Have a look. Isn't it beautiful?

996
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:40,042
Shopping for this watch?

997
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:43,126
I was half an hour late because of it.

998
01:05:43,126 --> 01:05:44,917
It took me a long time
to bargain with the sales.

999
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:48,292
He could less 3,000 at most.

1000
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,584
Like it?

1001
01:05:49,709 --> 01:05:51,042
You have no sense of time.

1002
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:52,209
It suits you more, keep for yourself.

1003
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:53,709
Next time...

1004
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:54,792
What's wrong with you?

1005
01:05:54,792 --> 01:05:57,584
You don't appreciate my gift.

1006
01:05:57,751 --> 01:05:58,834
I am leaving!

1007
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,876
What are you doing? Get away!

1008
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:27,501
Help...Doctor!

1009
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:29,209
Help!

1010
01:06:58,251 --> 01:06:59,542
You are...so ugly.

1011
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,501
Hello, teacher!

1012
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:10,001
"Butterflies are so beautiful."

1013
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:13,709
"Wearing pretty crowns,
Wearing flowered dresses."

1014
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:18,001
"You love flowers, flowers love you."

1015
01:08:18,001 --> 01:08:21,709
"You dance, flowers are pretty."

1016
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:26,001
"Butterflies are so beautiful."

1017
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:30,084
"Wearing pretty crowns,
wearing flowered dresses."

1018
01:08:30,084 --> 01:08:34,251
"You love flowers, flowers love you."

1019
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:37,959
"You dance, flowers are pretty."

1020
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:45,959
Why do you keep following me?

1021
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:48,709
I am sorry.

1022
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,792
Because...

1023
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:54,042
I follow you...

1024
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:58,251
Because...you look like my friend.

1025
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,876
You can speak Cantonese, I understand.

1026
01:09:03,251 --> 01:09:06,584
I was born in Hong Kong, studied in Taiwan.

1027
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:08,417
You speak Cantonese?

1028
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:11,626
You really look like my friend.

1029
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:14,792
I thought you were her, so I followed you.

1030
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:17,167
You are very straight forward.

1031
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:21,126
But she passed away.

1032
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,667
My name is Chan Ho Nam.

1033
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:32,459
I am Tuan-Mu Ruo Yu.

1034
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,626
You look exactly like her.

1035
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:38,667
Anything else? If not, I have to go inside.

1036
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:40,042
Can we be friends?

1037
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:03,709
Chicken...Something happened!

1038
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:05,042
Peel, Big Head.

1039
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:07,001
A car is coming, never seen it before.

1040
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:08,709
Chicken!

1041
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:12,792
- Chicken!
- Chicken, watch out!

1042
01:10:15,459 --> 01:10:16,792
Look after her.

1043
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:19,542
Yes.

1044
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:38,792
Father?

1045
01:10:41,209 --> 01:10:42,667
Chicken, are you here?

1046
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,376
This is your father!

1047
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:48,917
Father!

1048
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:50,834
Chicken!

1049
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,542
Glad to see you all right!

1050
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:54,209
I am fine.

1051
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:57,251
How are you?

1052
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:59,084
Don't worry about me.

1053
01:10:59,376 --> 01:11:03,584
Is Nanako okay?

1054
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:21,167
I am sorry. I got you involved.

1055
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:23,042
I am sorry.

1056
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:33,834
Akira not only works against us,

1057
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:38,042
he even discloses our secrets to the police.

1058
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:43,376
It's probably him...

1059
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:49,334
Putting me into this situation.

1060
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:53,501
Bastard!

1061
01:11:58,751 --> 01:12:03,167
As a triad chief,
I have handled many tough gang fights...

1062
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:08,459
Fought against many enemies...

1063
01:12:08,876 --> 01:12:11,542
It's not easy to reach where I am.

1064
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:19,001
But, I have never imagined
my adopted son would betray me.

1065
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:24,459
I treated him as my own son.

1066
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,251
I lose my mind.

1067
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:36,001
I was once betrayed by the woman I loved most.

1068
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:40,834
That feeling...

1069
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:54,626
I am heartbroken...

1070
01:12:56,584 --> 01:13:00,084
This disaster happened to Nanako.

1071
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:09,959
Father, she is my wife.

1072
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:12,959
I should have taken good care of her.

1073
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:15,459
I am sorry.

1074
01:13:18,459 --> 01:13:20,001
But I promise you...

1075
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:23,417
I will kill Akira with my very own hand.

1076
01:13:39,209 --> 01:13:40,917
Do you know you are so rude?

1077
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,209
Your phone was busy all day long.

1078
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,792
You left without telling me.

1079
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:45,501
I couldn't find you at the hotel.

1080
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:47,001
Do you know you worry me?

1081
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:48,917
I thought you had been chopped into pieces.

1082
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:52,251
I almost went to the squatters to find you.

1083
01:13:54,126 --> 01:13:56,126
I am hungry, let's go for dinner.

1084
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:57,376
Let's go?

1085
01:13:57,376 --> 01:13:58,876
No!

1086
01:13:58,876 --> 01:13:59,876
Why?

1087
01:14:00,126 --> 01:14:01,959
From a woman's intuition.

1088
01:14:02,376 --> 01:14:03,959
Something happened to you?

1089
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:06,584
I came back right after the business.

1090
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:08,917
No!

1091
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,626
Did you go out with a woman?

1092
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:15,917
No.

1093
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:17,001
Yes!

1094
01:14:17,584 --> 01:14:20,626
- You did! Your face told me so!
- No, I didn't...

1095
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:23,126
You did!

1096
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,792
Yeah, I just fooled around with girls.

1097
01:14:24,959 --> 01:14:26,042
Are you happy now?

1098
01:14:27,126 --> 01:14:28,417
That was not true.

1099
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:32,042
Why did you hide your secrets from me?

1100
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,542
What secrets?

1101
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:36,459
Even if we were married,
we should have our own privacy.

1102
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:42,917
That means, if we are not married,

1103
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:47,667
I have no right to ask you questions, right?

1104
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:52,084
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone!

1105
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:01,501
May I talk to Tuan-Mu Ruo Yu?

1106
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:03,459
Who are you looking for?

1107
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,292
Miss Tuan-Mu Ruo Yu...Yes.

1108
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:08,876
I am sorry, she is not here.

1109
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:10,084
Thank you!

1110
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:20,084
- Brother Nam!
- Hello. Willi.

1111
01:15:20,251 --> 01:15:22,209
Yes, what's up?

1112
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:24,126
I am calling my men from Hong Kong to here.

1113
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:25,626
No problem?

1114
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:26,542
No problem.

1115
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:28,167
I called my friends in Taiwan.

1116
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:29,626
Okay.

1117
01:15:33,917 --> 01:15:35,084
Where is Brave?

1118
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:37,709
We lost touch.

1119
01:15:38,126 --> 01:15:40,709
Recently, he opposed to complying
with the new government

1120
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:42,542
and argued with you several times.

1121
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:44,626
Maybe he is still mad.

1122
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:46,876
This stubborn old man.

1123
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,001
In no doubt, he is loyal.

1124
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:53,167
But he is too stubborn and conservative.

1125
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:56,292
This time, Chicken and Wah were attacked.

1126
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:59,459
People rumor that he is behind the scene.

1127
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:01,751
It is hard to say.

1128
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:06,001
For long, he has suspected
Chicken of assassinating you.

1129
01:16:07,251 --> 01:16:08,626
Have you found Chicken?

1130
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:10,709
Not yet.

1131
01:16:11,084 --> 01:16:12,417
Go to find him!

1132
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:14,334
Okay.

1133
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:18,126
Do you hear me? Hurry up?

1134
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,459
Yes!

1135
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:39,501
I am sorry to hear your bad news.

1136
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:41,126
But don't worry.

1137
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:43,417
I will track down Akira.

1138
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:46,917
Tell Chicken not to hide anymore.

1139
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:48,126
Ask him to come back.

1140
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:51,251
San Luen Gang will certainly back him up.

1141
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:56,167
We, San Luen Gang, lose face.

1142
01:16:56,209 --> 01:16:58,751
Getting you involved
in our own internal matters.

1143
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:03,751
I heard lots of rumors

1144
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:07,459
that Chicken wants
to take over the chief position

1145
01:17:07,459 --> 01:17:11,251
and someone will purge him.

1146
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,459
I have never suspected Chicken.

1147
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:15,709
We found out that
the chief of Black Dragon Gang

1148
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:19,834
Dragon masterminded the attack.

1149
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:24,834
As for whether Brave tried to kill Chicken,

1150
01:17:24,834 --> 01:17:26,751
we will investigate it.

1151
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:29,167
It's possible that

1152
01:17:29,167 --> 01:17:32,126
Akira colludes with the Black Dragon Gang.

1153
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:37,417
In fact, I shouldn't get involved
in your gang affairs.

1154
01:17:37,709 --> 01:17:39,376
But I must tell you,

1155
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:42,626
Chicken has been my best friend for years.

1156
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:44,667
Chicken is lucky to have...

1157
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:46,126
A great friend like you.

1158
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:51,292
Today, we are in the era of global village.

1159
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,667
San Luen Gang and Hung Hing Gang

1160
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:55,376
have established a good relationship.

1161
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:59,667
So, we should join forces

1162
01:17:59,834 --> 01:18:01,417
to fight off our common enemies.

1163
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:05,084
Taiwan's Black Dragon Gang
and Hong Kong's Tung Sing Gang.

1164
01:18:06,667 --> 01:18:08,501
I have no idea what  global village is.

1165
01:18:08,876 --> 01:18:11,667
But, I believe righteousness.

1166
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,917
And trust

1167
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,334
is the most important.

1168
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:27,376
Honestly, San Luen Gang
has many internal conflicts.

1169
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:31,542
So, I am forced to try to apply

1170
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:35,459
my management knowledge to run San Luen Gang.

1171
01:18:35,876 --> 01:18:37,751
In terms of capability and experience,

1172
01:18:37,751 --> 01:18:40,167
Chicken and Brave are the best candidates.

1173
01:18:40,626 --> 01:18:42,709
If Chicken wants to take over the seat,

1174
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:44,834
he will do so in a proper way.

1175
01:18:46,959 --> 01:18:48,917
To avoid San Luen Gang from collapse,

1176
01:18:50,084 --> 01:18:53,709
I recommend Brave to be the new chief.

1177
01:18:54,626 --> 01:18:56,959
Good decision.

1178
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:18,709
Have a great working relationship.

1179
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,876
Lui senior's son...

1180
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:42,626
He studied in the States and
is used to the American culture.

1181
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:46,626
Now, he wants reforms.

1182
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:51,167
It will be a disaster.

1183
01:19:56,084 --> 01:20:00,042
Kwong, Six Packs hasn't come back
from the doctor appointment yet?

1184
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,292
Yes.

1185
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:19,251
So look alike.

1186
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:21,417
Exactly the same.

1187
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:24,834
Is she my twin sister?

1188
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:27,042
Just kidding.

1189
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:31,667
She is your wife?

1190
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:38,209
You...have been engaged.

1191
01:20:47,584 --> 01:20:50,334
We planned to get married.

1192
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:00,667
Are you Japanese?

1193
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:04,334
Tuan-Mu is a Chinese surname.

1194
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,876
It sounds like a Japanese name.

1195
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:10,334
Have you heard of Confucius?

1196
01:21:10,459 --> 01:21:13,959
Yes, in high school.

1197
01:21:13,959 --> 01:21:15,667
We got a holiday to commemorate his birthday.

1198
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:19,126
Confucius had a student called Tsu Kuang.

1199
01:21:19,126 --> 01:21:21,251
His original family name was Tuan Mu Ci.

1200
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,292
He was the Tuan-Mu's first ancestor.

1201
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:26,542
A politician during the Spring
and Autumn Period (700-403 BC).

1202
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:29,167
Am I boring you?

1203
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:30,751
That's fine.

1204
01:21:30,917 --> 01:21:31,834
What's wrong?

1205
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:34,626
Nothing...Smartie spoke with a stammer.

1206
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:35,917
But you speak clearly.

1207
01:21:37,251 --> 01:21:38,292
Really?

1208
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:41,792
By the way, what brought you to Taiwan?

1209
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:43,417
Business.

1210
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:48,167
About time, I have to leave.

1211
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:49,667
I'll walk you out.

1212
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,292
No thanks.

1213
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:52,376
No, I'll walk with you.

1214
01:22:11,834 --> 01:22:13,584
You came to pick up children?

1215
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:16,792
No, I came to talk to you.

1216
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:27,001
I knew Chan Ho Nam for only few days,
just an acquaintance.

1217
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:28,751
Please don't mistake me.

1218
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:32,959
Not really.

1219
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:37,834
I know he could never forget Smartie.

1220
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:41,126
He even calls her name in his sleep.

1221
01:22:42,584 --> 01:22:45,834
No one can ever replace her in his heart.

1222
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:50,251
My three year relationship with him

1223
01:22:51,376 --> 01:22:53,792
is no better than your one minute with him.

1224
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:02,959
I...

1225
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:07,001
I enjoy chatting with him.

1226
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:10,001
But I have never thought of staying with him.

1227
01:23:13,709 --> 01:23:16,751
Especially after you told me
your relationship with him.

1228
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:23,042
I didn't come to protest.

1229
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:24,251
No.

1230
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:27,792
I just want to see.

1231
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,376
To talk to you.

1232
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:32,751
Do you know...

1233
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:41,001
I believe in destiny.

1234
01:23:41,334 --> 01:23:43,334
When it comes, you can't resist it.

1235
01:23:44,084 --> 01:23:45,959
When it leaves, you can't make it stay.

1236
01:23:50,084 --> 01:23:52,376
All right, I am leaving.

1237
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:39,584
Pay homage to family.

1238
01:24:57,501 --> 01:24:58,709
Please accept my condolence.

1239
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:02,834
Don't worry, I will take care of your living.

1240
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:39,292
First bow.

1241
01:25:41,209 --> 01:25:43,917
Second bow.

1242
01:25:46,334 --> 01:25:49,251
Third bow.

1243
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:52,542
It is my fault...

1244
01:25:53,251 --> 01:25:55,584
If I were there...

1245
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,792
You shouldn't have died.

1246
01:25:59,084 --> 01:26:02,292
- Brother, I am sorry.
- Present flowers.

1247
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:21,167
Where is Chicken?

1248
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:22,917
Bring him here!

1249
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,709
He must be linked to Brave's death!

1250
01:26:25,959 --> 01:26:28,917
Today, I come to pay respect
on behalf of Hung Hing Gang.

1251
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:31,459
But I can tell, we are not welcomed.

1252
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:35,542
Of course not, we appreciate your coming.

1253
01:26:36,501 --> 01:26:38,917
The other day

1254
01:26:38,959 --> 01:26:40,376
Lui told you about appointing
Brave as the chief.

1255
01:26:40,376 --> 01:26:42,042
Two days later, Brave was killed.

1256
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:44,417
What a coincidence.

1257
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:45,959
What do you mean?

1258
01:26:46,126 --> 01:26:47,584
Chicken is your buddy.

1259
01:26:47,584 --> 01:26:49,917
You want your best friend to be the gang chief.

1260
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:51,792
It is understandable.

1261
01:26:51,876 --> 01:26:53,167
It is unfounded accusation.

1262
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:54,876
Nonsense.

1263
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:57,251
Kam, watch your words.

1264
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:00,084
Who killed Brave?

1265
01:27:00,334 --> 01:27:01,917
I will investigate it.

1266
01:27:02,292 --> 01:27:03,334
Please.

1267
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,251
Thanks.

1268
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:17,209
First bow.

1269
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:21,459
Second bow.

1270
01:27:23,876 --> 01:27:26,251
Third bow.

1271
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:32,876
Chicken, good timing!

1272
01:27:32,876 --> 01:27:34,792
I'll cut your head and
take your blood as sacrifices to Brave!

1273
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,501
Avenge for Brave's death!

1274
01:27:43,751 --> 01:27:45,376
- Are you crazy?
- Calm down...

1275
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:48,542
How dare you cut my head and take my blood!

1276
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:52,751
Come, if you have guts.

1277
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:56,042
Don't trust him! He is the traitor!

1278
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:58,667
Brave opposes to his succession,
so he kills him!

1279
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,751
When he knows Brave is going to be the chief...

1280
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:02,001
He murders him!

1281
01:28:02,001 --> 01:28:03,459
- Yes!
- Who told you that?

1282
01:28:03,459 --> 01:28:04,709
We all knew about it!

1283
01:28:15,126 --> 01:28:16,417
Come on!

1284
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:20,626
Who ever saw him kill Brave?

1285
01:28:21,209 --> 01:28:23,667
Who? Any proof?

1286
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,084
Don't be so exaggerated, buddy.

1287
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:44,209
What should we do?

1288
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:47,126
They collude with one another.

1289
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:49,751
Save us trouble.

1290
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:51,751
Right!

1291
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,584
We live in a civilized society.

1292
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:04,917
Evidence matters.

1293
01:29:05,334 --> 01:29:10,501
Without any evidence, we can't accuse Chicken.

1294
01:29:11,334 --> 01:29:15,334
Please be patient.

1295
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:17,542
Director Kusakari.

1296
01:29:20,251 --> 01:29:21,292
Mr. Lui.

1297
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:27,251
Chicken is my son-in-law.

1298
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:33,667
San Luen Gang and Yamada Gang
are on the same side.

1299
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:37,126
And Chicken is my family.

1300
01:29:37,626 --> 01:29:43,501
If enough evidence is found to prove him guilty,

1301
01:29:45,626 --> 01:29:52,126
I will kill him with my own hands!

1302
01:29:53,751 --> 01:29:55,834
Director Kusakari is a reasonable man.

1303
01:29:56,376 --> 01:29:57,626
I admire you.

1304
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:05,292
Before we find any evidence,

1305
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:10,876
Chicken will be in my hands.

1306
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,459
I will send my personal apology to you.

1307
01:30:26,001 --> 01:30:28,459
Today is Brave's funeral.

1308
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:32,626
Even if we want to purge the traitor,

1309
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:35,501
we should wait after the ceremony.

1310
01:30:37,251 --> 01:30:39,334
Although Chicken is the most suspicious,

1311
01:30:40,084 --> 01:30:41,917
I will investigate it.

1312
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:44,084
And won't wrongly accuse him.

1313
01:30:50,376 --> 01:30:51,959
Everybody, listen up.

1314
01:30:54,334 --> 01:30:56,542
Before he is proven guilty,

1315
01:30:58,042 --> 01:31:01,667
no one can touch him.

1316
01:31:01,876 --> 01:31:05,376
Or, I will take it as a challenge against me.

1317
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:12,084
Same to Hong Kong's Hung Hing Gang.

1318
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:15,917
- Chicken.
- Yes?

1319
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:17,376
Go pay respect.

1320
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:18,626
Yes!

1321
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:39,917
Brave.

1322
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:45,126
I believe you don't want to
see our gang collapse.

1323
01:32:02,834 --> 01:32:06,876
"What a romantic breakup
Mei Ling"

1324
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:32,917
Where are you?

1325
01:32:33,001 --> 01:32:35,126
It is me, Tuan-Mu Ruo Yu.

1326
01:32:44,126 --> 01:32:46,167
I've come to tell you

1327
01:32:48,792 --> 01:32:49,959
I'm getting married.

1328
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:54,209
I don't want to give up my marriage...

1329
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:00,084
simply because of a touching fairy tale.

1330
01:33:01,959 --> 01:33:03,917
I am not Smartie.

1331
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:05,834
Sorry.

1332
01:33:08,001 --> 01:33:09,126
Goodbye.

1333
01:33:38,251 --> 01:33:39,334
Sorry.

1334
01:34:57,001 --> 01:34:59,209
In view of the current situation,

1335
01:34:59,334 --> 01:35:03,042
I accept to be the chief and lead San Luen Gang.

1336
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:07,542
Mr. Lui.

1337
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:12,626
You deserve it.
San Luen gang members all support you.

1338
01:35:12,917 --> 01:35:15,501
All members will follow your directions.

1339
01:35:15,834 --> 01:35:19,959
About our government's offer.

1340
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:22,167
It shouldn't be a problem.

1341
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:23,459
Absolutely fine.

1342
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:25,751
But I have a request.

1343
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:27,459
Request?

1344
01:35:28,459 --> 01:35:30,751
I determine to unify all the triads in Taiwan.

1345
01:35:30,959 --> 01:35:34,251
All the triads will be under my control.

1346
01:35:34,751 --> 01:35:37,292
Or, they will die.

1347
01:35:38,126 --> 01:35:41,584
Even the old San Luen Gang will be eliminated.

1348
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:44,209
I will set up a new division.

1349
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:49,459
Smart and bright.

1350
01:35:49,626 --> 01:35:51,542
Ambitious. Great!

1351
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:52,709
Have a great working relation.

1352
01:36:31,709 --> 01:36:32,667
Father.

1353
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:36,292
I want to read my wedding vow

1354
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:38,292
once more before you

1355
01:36:39,001 --> 01:36:42,376
and Nanako. May I?

1356
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:56,542
From today onwards...

1357
01:36:57,751 --> 01:37:01,501
We must love and respect each other,
form a family.

1358
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:05,126
Share our sweetness and bitterness forever.

1359
01:37:09,834 --> 01:37:12,001
No matter what happened in the past,

1360
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:13,959
or will happen in the future,

1361
01:37:15,501 --> 01:37:16,876
you are my wife.

1362
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:22,376
I will take care of you for the rest of my life.

1363
01:37:39,542 --> 01:37:41,417
Harder!

1364
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:56,209
Chicken, I am sorry.

1365
01:37:57,292 --> 01:38:00,667
It is Lui who ordered his men to kill Brave.

1366
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:04,501
Kwong told me

1367
01:38:05,209 --> 01:38:07,292
Kam followed Lui's command.

1368
01:38:08,542 --> 01:38:10,334
Hired Kwong as hit man to murder Brave.

1369
01:38:10,792 --> 01:38:12,709
He promised to pay him a large sum of money.

1370
01:38:13,709 --> 01:38:17,209
But, after Brave's funeral,

1371
01:38:17,501 --> 01:38:19,334
Kam didn't pay him the money.

1372
01:38:20,209 --> 01:38:21,834
Even tried to kill Kwong.

1373
01:38:25,334 --> 01:38:28,709
Kwong told me the truth before he died.

1374
01:38:32,834 --> 01:38:35,334
Brave was loyal to San Luen Gang...

1375
01:38:36,751 --> 01:38:38,751
But ended up being killed by Lui...

1376
01:38:40,001 --> 01:38:44,084
Because he strongly opposed
to complying with the government.

1377
01:38:44,917 --> 01:38:46,376
Strongly against pacification.

1378
01:38:47,709 --> 01:38:49,001
Because of this issue,

1379
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:51,459
he argued with Lui for several times.

1380
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:53,876
Their relationship was in a deadlock.

1381
01:38:55,709 --> 01:38:56,959
I also heard that

1382
01:38:58,042 --> 01:39:00,501
Lui accepted the post of gangster chief.

1383
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:05,792
He chooses to inaugurate on May 20th...

1384
01:39:06,292 --> 01:39:08,042
And renames San Luen Gang.

1385
01:39:09,001 --> 01:39:12,084
Also, Kam has sent out a secret order.

1386
01:39:13,126 --> 01:39:14,751
After Lui's inauguration,

1387
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:19,376
all the gangs must follow his order.

1388
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:21,751
Or, they will be annihilated.

1389
01:39:22,459 --> 01:39:23,542
Annihilation?

1390
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:26,084
Is Lui capable of doing so?

1391
01:39:26,584 --> 01:39:29,459
Rumor has it that

1392
01:39:29,751 --> 01:39:33,126
Lui has reached an agreement
with the government.

1393
01:39:34,417 --> 01:39:36,834
The new government will back him up in secret.

1394
01:39:46,292 --> 01:39:48,501
Lui always said
he was not interested in gang affairs.

1395
01:39:49,834 --> 01:39:52,876
But it was all part of his conspiracy,
making me the scapegoat.

1396
01:39:54,042 --> 01:39:55,667
You are his sworn enemy

1397
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:58,709
and the son-in-law of Yamada Gang's chief.

1398
01:39:58,917 --> 01:40:00,667
I have never thought of fighting
the seat against him.

1399
01:40:00,959 --> 01:40:03,501
But he feels threatened by you.

1400
01:40:04,084 --> 01:40:07,501
He provokes internal conflicts
to get rid of his rivals.

1401
01:40:08,042 --> 01:40:09,876
Obviously, you are framed.

1402
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:12,292
Then, he pretends to be understanding...

1403
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:14,542
And widely supported by different units.

1404
01:40:15,417 --> 01:40:16,667
He is deadly ambitious.

1405
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:21,292
Eliminate all his opponents and
unify the underworld.

1406
01:40:22,501 --> 01:40:24,209
He must see himself
as the Chinese First Emperor Qin?

1407
01:40:28,292 --> 01:40:30,501
Brother Nam, all of our Hung Hing members
are refused entry into Taiwan.

1408
01:40:33,459 --> 01:40:35,417
Same as Yamada Gang.

1409
01:40:36,376 --> 01:40:38,959
With the government backing him up,
he can do whatever he wants.

1410
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:03,001
Thank you! Come again!

1411
01:41:45,584 --> 01:41:46,584
Hello?

1412
01:41:46,584 --> 01:41:48,376
Listen, this is Chicken.

1413
01:41:48,459 --> 01:41:49,709
I am at your house

1414
01:41:49,709 --> 01:41:51,709
holding your wife and children hostage.

1415
01:41:51,876 --> 01:41:54,876
If you cooperate with me, they will be fine.

1416
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:57,626
All right. I understand.

1417
01:41:58,917 --> 01:42:00,042
What happened?

1418
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:02,876
Nothing.

1419
01:42:04,834 --> 01:42:08,834
The preparation for the inauguration
is almost ready.

1420
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:12,834
Most of the guests have arrived.

1421
01:42:43,959 --> 01:42:47,959
Bow to our national flag and founding father.

1422
01:42:48,667 --> 01:42:51,251
First bow.

1423
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:55,542
Second bow.

1424
01:42:56,959 --> 01:42:59,501
Third bow.

1425
01:43:01,459 --> 01:43:04,376
Bestowed with Presidential Seal
and Presidential Stamp.

1426
01:43:13,084 --> 01:43:14,334
Vow.

1427
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:21,042
With the most solemn respect and sincerity.

1428
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:22,542
- I declare...
- On 2000...

1429
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:23,709
May 20.

1430
01:43:23,917 --> 01:43:27,376
At an important and meaningful historic moment,

1431
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:31,209
I, Lui Fu Kwan, am inaugurated
as the chief of San Luen Gang

1432
01:43:31,834 --> 01:43:35,667
Our new government and political party
will be inaugurated today.

1433
01:43:36,959 --> 01:43:40,251
With the end of the old century,
we welcome the new millennium.

1434
01:43:40,834 --> 01:43:43,834
We will certainly look forward to reform.

1435
01:43:44,376 --> 01:43:48,501
To lead our gang to a rich
and successful new era.

1436
01:43:49,917 --> 01:43:53,251
Also, I have devised
a new set of foreign policy

1437
01:43:53,959 --> 01:43:57,084
to join force and establish
good relation with overseas gangs,

1438
01:43:57,084 --> 01:43:59,584
to achieve peaceful co-existence.

1439
01:44:01,459 --> 01:44:04,417
On this occasion, I would like to announce that

1440
01:44:05,084 --> 01:44:07,292
Panther unit head, Ko Chi Wah, was killed.

1441
01:44:07,584 --> 01:44:11,626
Poisonous Snake unit head Chicken betrayed us
and was expelled.

1442
01:44:12,501 --> 01:44:15,584
Therefore, I decide to merge
these two units into one.

1443
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:17,459
The new unit head is

1444
01:44:18,459 --> 01:44:21,542
Mr. Kusakari Akira from Japan.

1445
01:44:22,917 --> 01:44:25,167
Although he has a Japanese name,

1446
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:27,584
he is one hundred percent Chinese.

1447
01:44:28,042 --> 01:44:31,292
Although he is the adopted-son
of Yamada Gang's chief,

1448
01:44:31,876 --> 01:44:35,084
he disgusts the collusion
between Ichio and Chicken.

1449
01:44:35,084 --> 01:44:36,709
As they scheme to annex San Luen Gang,

1450
01:44:37,501 --> 01:44:41,917
for the sake of righteousness,
Mr. Ichro joins our camp.

1451
01:44:43,334 --> 01:44:44,834
I very much admire him.

1452
01:44:45,709 --> 01:44:47,251
May we greet him with our warmest applause.

1453
01:44:47,251 --> 01:44:49,959
Welcome to join San Luen's big family!

1454
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:01,751
I am sorry, I am late.

1455
01:45:10,709 --> 01:45:13,626
Traitor! How dare you show up here?

1456
01:45:13,876 --> 01:45:16,126
Old men, shut up.

1457
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:19,292
You are right, it is time to purge our enemy.

1458
01:45:19,292 --> 01:45:20,667
But this person is not Chicken.

1459
01:45:21,376 --> 01:45:22,709
He is Luis Fu Kwan!

1460
01:45:24,084 --> 01:45:27,001
I can prove that Chicken is innocent.

1461
01:45:27,834 --> 01:45:29,584
Brave was not killed by him.

1462
01:45:31,209 --> 01:45:33,292
But by you, Luis Fu Kwan!

1463
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:35,792
Chicken taught you
to talk to me like this, right?

1464
01:45:36,001 --> 01:45:37,542
What favors did he give you?

1465
01:45:38,626 --> 01:45:41,792
We all know Brave is loyal to San Luen Gang.

1466
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:44,084
I respect him...

1467
01:45:44,376 --> 01:45:46,501
And even recommend him to be the chief.

1468
01:45:47,042 --> 01:45:48,459
Help me! Dad...

1469
01:45:48,459 --> 01:45:50,251
It is impossible that I would kill him.

1470
01:45:50,251 --> 01:45:51,751
Why not?

1471
01:45:53,834 --> 01:45:55,792
Because you want to be king of the triads.

1472
01:45:57,126 --> 01:45:59,001
To unify and control all the triads in Taiwan.

1473
01:46:00,209 --> 01:46:01,209
Am I right?

1474
01:46:02,501 --> 01:46:06,042
Would you believe in the traitor?

1475
01:46:07,084 --> 01:46:10,126
You may not believe in Chicken.

1476
01:46:10,459 --> 01:46:11,959
But, if...

1477
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:14,501
Kam, please explain.

1478
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:25,751
Chicken and Six Packs told you the truth.

1479
01:46:26,626 --> 01:46:29,834
Lui ordered the killing of Brave

1480
01:46:29,834 --> 01:46:31,792
in order to frame Chicken.

1481
01:46:33,876 --> 01:46:35,042
Before that...

1482
01:46:36,292 --> 01:46:39,292
Lui masterminded the assault of himself.

1483
01:46:40,042 --> 01:46:41,626
He did it on purpose...

1484
01:46:42,626 --> 01:46:45,417
To turn Chicken into a suspect,
an outcast, why?

1485
01:46:45,417 --> 01:46:47,834
Because Chicken is the son-in-law
of Yamada Gang's chief.

1486
01:46:48,251 --> 01:46:50,751
Luis feels threatened.

1487
01:46:50,751 --> 01:46:52,542
Kam, you also take bribes from Chicken.

1488
01:46:52,917 --> 01:46:55,626
Betray me and San Luen Gang.

1489
01:46:59,001 --> 01:47:00,042
Please continue.

1490
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:05,667
Liu...

1491
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:09,834
Luis Fu Kwan is
the real power hungry, ambitious man.

1492
01:47:10,876 --> 01:47:13,459
He has reached an agreement
with the new government.

1493
01:47:13,459 --> 01:47:15,542
After his inauguration,

1494
01:47:15,542 --> 01:47:19,292
he will totally comply with the new government.

1495
01:47:19,959 --> 01:47:23,792
In return, the government helps eliminate
all the triads for him

1496
01:47:25,167 --> 01:47:27,084
so he can become a dictator.

1497
01:47:27,084 --> 01:47:29,709
Chicken taught you to fabricate the story?

1498
01:47:32,459 --> 01:47:33,917
Did he bribe you?

1499
01:47:34,834 --> 01:47:36,126
Or threaten you?

1500
01:47:36,459 --> 01:47:38,417
I can prove if

1501
01:47:39,834 --> 01:47:42,751
Kam is telling us the truth.

1502
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:49,126
I negotiate with Luis
on behalf of the new government.

1503
01:47:52,001 --> 01:47:53,501
I am sorry, Mr. Lui.

1504
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:56,501
You demands are too harsh.

1505
01:47:57,084 --> 01:48:01,001
The President and his chief of staff
discussed the issue.

1506
01:48:01,959 --> 01:48:05,334
They can't accept your unreasonable demands.

1507
01:48:07,959 --> 01:48:10,334
Okay!

1508
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:38,209
Dad, please forgive me.

1509
01:48:38,626 --> 01:48:40,959
Answer me.

1510
01:48:43,876 --> 01:48:48,334
You are behind the conspiracy?

1511
01:49:28,042 --> 01:49:29,626
Help yourself.

1512
01:49:37,251 --> 01:49:40,209
I appreciate it.

1513
01:49:49,084 --> 01:49:50,959
This one is for my wife!

1514
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:54,626
Dad!

1515
01:50:27,792 --> 01:50:28,751
Shit!

1516
01:50:50,417 --> 01:50:52,917
Chan Ho Nam, let me go!

1517
01:50:52,917 --> 01:50:55,876
In the triad, righteousness is important,
especially to our brothers.

1518
01:51:27,292 --> 01:51:28,334
Come on!

1519
01:52:19,292 --> 01:52:20,501
You set me up.

1520
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:21,501
I tell you...

1521
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:26,501
Our new government determines
to end political corruption.

1522
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:28,209
To annihilate the triads!

1523
01:52:28,209 --> 01:52:29,542
Bullshit!

1524
01:52:31,209 --> 01:52:32,209
Take him away!

1525
01:52:32,542 --> 01:52:33,667
Go!

1526
01:52:41,709 --> 01:52:43,876
Are you Chan Ho Nam?

1527
01:53:03,417 --> 01:53:04,334
Thank you for your help.

1528
01:53:04,334 --> 01:53:05,876
Not at all.

1529
01:53:05,876 --> 01:53:07,626
I just do the right thing.

1530
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:11,084
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, goodbye.

1531
01:53:17,626 --> 01:53:20,917
Father, you speak Mandarin?

1532
01:53:21,126 --> 01:53:22,667
Of course.

1533
01:53:23,084 --> 01:53:26,876
He studied in Japan. We were classmates.

1534
01:53:26,876 --> 01:53:30,709
So was Taiwan ex-president Lee Ten Hui.

1535
01:53:31,876 --> 01:53:33,334
I see!

1536
01:53:33,584 --> 01:53:34,584
What did you father say?

1537
01:53:34,584 --> 01:53:37,001
He said both the politician
and the ex-president

1538
01:53:37,001 --> 01:53:38,459
were his classmates.

1539
01:53:39,667 --> 01:53:40,626
Thank you.

1540
01:53:46,501 --> 01:53:49,251
Today is May 20th.
The president gave his inaugural address.

1541
01:53:49,251 --> 01:53:51,042
Would China attack Taiwan?

1542
01:53:52,459 --> 01:53:55,292
Guess not! We are all Chinese.

1543
01:53:55,292 --> 01:53:56,917
Chinese fight Chinese?
