00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,150
Mrs. Peterson !

0
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,560
Ramon hey !
How's it goin' ?

0
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,980
How you doin' ?

0
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,110
There it is
right there on the desk.

0
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,490
- Where's she headed ?
- She's snowbound Ramon.

0
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,290
- See you went with the pink.
- Yeah yeah.

0
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,500
It's kind of
a pink day today.

0
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,460
I'm gonna have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

0
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,710
- All right. We'll see you then.
- All right. Thanks Ramon.

0
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,340
Bless my soul
What's wrong with me

0
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,630
I'm itchin' like a man
on a fuzzy tree

0
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
My friends say I'm actin'
wild as a bug

0
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm in love

0
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,580
- Peterson ! Peterson !

0
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,040
- Peterson.

0
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,300
- Mr. Cowboy da ?
- Da.

0
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,850
Mmm it's pretty.

0
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,020
Mmm.
It's from my wife.

0
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Time...

0
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,920
- rules over us without mercy

0
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,760
not caring if we're healthy or ill
hungry or drunk

0
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,470
Russian American
beings from Mars.

0
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,480
It's like a fire. It could either
destroy us or keep us warm.

0
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,230
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

0
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,150
Because we live or we die
by the clock.

0
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,150
We never turn our back
on it.

0
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,280
And we never ever
allow ourselves...

0
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,660
the sin of losing track
of time !

0
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,780
Locally it's 1:56.

0
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,740
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes...

0
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,750
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

0
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,170
- That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...

0
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,170
before this pulsating accursed
relentless taskmaster...

0
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,840
tries to put us
out of business.

0
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,010
Hey Nicolai. Hey.
Nicolai good to see you.

0
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,970
How are you kid ?
Look what you did.

0
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,140
You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.

0
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,810
That deserves something special
like a Snickers bar...

0
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,770
and a C.D. player.

0
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,770
And something to listen to-
a C.D. There.

0
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,650
Elvis Presley.
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

0
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,650
You all recognize this
don't you ?

0
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,450
I took the liberty
of sending this to myself.

0
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,490
I FedEx'd it
before I left Memphis.

0
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,700
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

0
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,120
What could it possibly be ?
ls it architectural plans ?

0
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,130
Maybe technical drawings ?

0
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,960
Is this the new wallpaper
for the- for the bathroom ?

0
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,800
It is... a clock

0
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,800
which I started
at absolute zero...

0
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,850
and is now at 87 hours
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

0
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,810
From Memphis America
to Nicolai in Russia 87 hours.

0
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,110
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

0
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,240
This is just an egg timer !

0
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,070
What if it had been something else ?
Like your paycheck ?

0
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,280
- Or fresh boysenberries ?
Or adoption papers ?

0
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,410
Eighty-seven hours
is an eternity.

0
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,450
The cosmos was created
in less time !

0
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,330
Wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours !

0
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,330
Fortunes made and squandered.

0
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,460
What ?

0
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,470
What are you saying
about me ?

0
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,470
I tell them
what do they expect ?

0
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,260
This man when his truck broke down
he stole a boy's bicycle
to do his delivery.

0
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,060
I borrowed it !
I borrowed a kid's bike.

0
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,310
And I got my packages delivered
and that is what you people
are gonna have to start doing.

0
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,900
You have to start doing
whatever it takes because
in three hours and two minutes...

0
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,110
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck...

0
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,110
and on its way
to the airport.

0
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,740
- Fifteen minutes !

0
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,120
- Crunch time ! Crunch time !
- Crunch time !

0
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,460
Let's go ! Every package
on the airport truck.

0
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,580
Go !
Crunch crunch crunch !

0
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,630
- We have a big problem.
- What ?

0
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,420
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What do you mean ?

0
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,090
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how ? ln snow ? ln ice ?

0
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,680
It's stuck ! The most important truck-
the Kremlin truck ! Many packages.

0
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,060
All right all right all right.
Let's put the table right here.

0
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,070
We'll just do the sort.

0
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,280
Ah yeah a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

0
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,950
Let's go. Unload-
Get him out of there.

0
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,620
Right here.
Two lines two lines.

0
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,580
One to the airport truck
one to the Moscow truck.

0
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,290
Got it ?

0
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,960
C.D.G. F.E. M.E
Memphis on the airport truck.
Everything else right there.

0
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,750
Nicolai ! Tick-tock tick-tock.
Four minutes.

0
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,670
Hi this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck press one.

0
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,930
Otherwise leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

0
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,010
- Hello Kelly. Are you there ?

0
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,600
Pick up pick up pick up
pick up. You're not there.

0
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,680
You're not gonna believe this. I'm doin'
the sorts in the middle of Red Square...

0
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,690
in the shadow
of Lenin's tomb.

0
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,690
I miss you

0
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,820
I miss you
I really wanna kiss you

0
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,730
I'm outta here in two minutes and
I'm pickin' up the sweep through Paris

0
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,400
so I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours or so.

0
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,610
That's the good news.
The bad news is...

0
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,620
I gotta go to
the dentist this week.

0
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
I got something in there
that's hurtin'.

0
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,540
I love you and I'm gonna see you soon
and you know what that means.

0
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,250
Bye-bye. Nicolai ! Tick-tock
tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock !

0
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,810
- I absolutely positively
have to get to Memphis tonight.

0
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,940
Can't help you.
Try U.P.S.

0
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,690
With this extra head wind are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort ?

0
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,150
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best" huh ?

0
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,490
Gwen is there something wrong
with our doctors that Jack
keeps getting certified to fly ?

0
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,910
- Aren't you concerned ?
- I'm terrified.

0
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,950
But a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

0
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,910
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal. Relentless !

0
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,170
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle...

0
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,590
- when his truck broke down ?
- I borrowed it.

0
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,800
But I love that
the kid's now crippled.

0
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,380
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes ?

0
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,340
Two minutes.
Actually it was less than that.

0
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,350
The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel

0
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,350
picked up the speed
and made up the time.

0
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,560
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

0
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,690
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late
and then six minutes
and eight minutes late.

0
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,740
- Next thing you know
we're the U.S. Mail.
- Yeah well-

0
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,360
All I'm sayin' is if you'd
gotten all those trucks on the plane

0
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,200
those Russkies would be
walking on water right now.

0
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,740
Hey don't-
Don't gimme that look.

0
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,290
- It's just grape juice. Right Chuck ?
- Yeah.

0
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,460
It's like a 1992
full-bodied grape juice.

0
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,750
I see no evil hear no evil
speak no evil.

0
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,210
We'd offer you some but you know
somebody's got to fly the plane.

0
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,760
Yeah well
I "just say no" right ?

0
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,640
Listen Stan
I've been meaning to ask you.

0
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
How's Mary ?

0
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,140
Oh. Uh well

0
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,310
- we really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hmm.

0
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,270
Uh she went to
the doctor yesterday and uh

0
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,150
it hasn't meta-
metastasized...

0
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,200
as far as they
can tell right now.

0
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,200
It's just kind of
wait and see.

0
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,450
I'm so sorry.

0
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,790
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

0
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,170
I want you to know Stan
we are all thinking about her and you.

0
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,960
- And just blessings.
- Thank you Gwen.

0
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,630
Hi this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck press one.

0
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,680
Otherwise leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

0
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,640
Stan.

0
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,190
Listen.
Uh I heard about this-

0
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,150
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory in Atlanta.

0
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,150
Uh he's supposed to be
the absolute best.

0
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,320
He worked on
Frank Toretta's wife.

0
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,320
Frank Toretta is
a systems analyst.

0
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,870
He played center field for us.
You know him.

0
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,620
In the softball tournament
last Labor Day.

0
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,540
Anyway beside the point.

0
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,170
Uh what I was thinking is
is that I could get his number-

0
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,880
the doctor-
and uh

0
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,420
you know
put you all together and-

0
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,390
You know you could
get this thing fixed.

0
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,390
You could beat it.

0
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Thanks Chuck.

0
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,230
So I'll get his number.

0
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,550
- Is Kelly Frears around ?
- She's copying her dissertation.

0
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,410
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

0
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,410
I love that you're home.

0
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,560
Just days before Santa departs
on his annual gift-giving venture

0
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,570
he's been declared
physically fit to fly.

0
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,490
Santa got checked out by doctors at
the V.A. Hospital in Augusta Georgia.

0
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,410
After they declared
the jolly old elfin tiptop shape

0
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,990
Santa Claus took off into the wild
blue yonder for an early start.

0
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,580
In Sarajevo
he spent the day with children

0
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,500
handing out presents and
even helping them decorate...

0
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,500
the special Christmas tree.

0
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,050
Santa and a sea of elves
took over the floor...

0
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,050
at the Hong Kong
Futures Exchange.

0
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,510
Market traders
bought Santa hats donating-

0
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,040
The turkey's a little dry
isn't it ?

0
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,620
- No.
- The turkey is perfect.

0
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,710
- How many did you do last night ?
- Last night ? 2.9 million.

0
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,340
Now you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

0
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,880
Here you go.

0
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,930
2.9 has got to be
the record.

0
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,930
Look at those marshmallows.

0
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,020
When I was there
we did two million.

0
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,600
- We thought that was a big deal.
- The glory days.

0
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,230
- What'd they do the first night ?
- The very first night ?

0
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,230
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

0
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,980
- Hell no. Twelve.
- That's right.

0
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,820
And they did the sort
right there on a card table.

0
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,610
And Fred Smith had
that card table bronzed.

0
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,410
I've been hearing that
for five years.

0
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,660
- It's in his office today.
- They go from that to
the new hub up in Anchorage.

0
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,670
It's state of the art-
a perfect marriage...

0
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,210
between technology
and systems management.

0
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,050
Speaking of marriage Chuck
when are you gonna make
an honest woman out of Kelly ?

0
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,300
- How long ?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

0
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,640
- You won. I owe you $5.
- So I win.

0
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
- Way before the pie.
- I told him on the way up.

0
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,930
Right about the time
the pie came out the marriage-

0
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Kelly is still recovering from her
failed relationship with that parolee.

0
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,270
He was a lawyer.

0
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,610
I knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand...

0
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,610
and swearing
to tell the truth.

0
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,780
Remember when he fell on the sidewalk
and broke his shoulder
at the wedding reception ?

0
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,620
He tripped on a curb
holding a door open for me.

0
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,040
- Aunt Kelly was married before ?
- It's not even worth remembering.

0
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,000
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee-

0
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,090
- Oh my God.
- Kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.

0
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,130
What're you gonna
attach it to Hoss ?

0
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,090
When you wear it to bed I hope
you got one of those things...

0
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,010
that go vibratin'.

0
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,510
Watch it.
I'm not touching that.

0
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,970
Oh did you
hit an olive pit ?

0
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,310
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No no it's not that.

0
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,920
- Okay I'll cancel Saturday.
- No don't.

0
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,930
If I'm not here I'm not.
But if I am well

0
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,930
- then I am.
- It's cancelled.

0
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,930
But you gotta be here
New Year's Eve.

0
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,430
Malaysia can't be that bad.
I'll be here New Year's Eve.

0
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,980
- When are you defending
your dissertation ?
-January 12.

0
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm gonna have to
switch over the South America thing.

0
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,900
If I do that
on the third or fourth

0
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm gonna have to head
back out on the 13th.

0
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,200
So long as you're here
New Year's Eve.

0
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,240
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

0
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,920
- What ?
- What about our Christmas ?
I got a gift for you.

0
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,170
We have to do it
in the car.

0
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,340
You'll be doing all right

0
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,510
I'd just like a minute over here
all right ? Thanks.

0
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,060
But I'll have a blue

0
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,480
-Blue blue blue Christmas
- Two minutes okay ?

0
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,110
Two more minutes.
Thanks. Hey !

0
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,650
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

0
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,530
- No.
- What is the ribbon ?
ls it a thousand-pound...

0
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,950
- test fishing line or something ?
- Here's your fancy thing.

0
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,740
Thanks.

0
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,830
I love the wrapping.

0
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
- And I love the box.
- Good.

0
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,220
Oh. Oh my.

0
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,260
Oh that is terrific.

0
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,810
My granddaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

0
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Hey I took this. This is
my favorite picture of you.

0
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,070
You know what I'm gonna do ?
I'm always gonna keep this...

0
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,820
on Memphis time.

0
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,620
Kelly time.

0
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,740
Hmm.

0
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,790
You haven't said anything about
your presents. Is there a problem ?

0
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm sorry no !
I love 'em.

0
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,250
Look at my journal.
Ah !

0
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,090
- What about the pager ?
- Real leather.
The pages have gold on 'em.

0
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,220
- Did you like the pager or not ?
- Yes.

0
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,050
I love it. Look at him in
his little blue Russian house.

0
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,010
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

0
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,560
- It's not one of those loud ones ?
- No. You can program it
so it vibrates...

0
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,230
and lights up
and see it in the dark.

0
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,360
It seems like
a real nice pager.

0
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,110
- Sorry about the hand towels.
You're hard to shop for.
- No no. I love 'em.

0
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,240
- Every time I wash my hands
I will think of you.
- All right I gotta go.

0
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,240
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

0
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,250
- I love you.
- I love you too.

0
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,590
Chuck ! Keys !

0
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,640
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

0
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,150
I have one more present
for you.

0
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,360
Only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present...

0
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,360
Iike say hand towels.

0
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,870
Which were a joke
by the way.

0
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm terrified.

0
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,830
Just take it and hold onto it
and you can open it...

0
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,550
on New Year's Eve.

0
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,550
And I love you.

0
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,140
I'll be right back.

Hello !

0
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,100
Anybody !

0
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,730
Anybody !

0
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,990
Help !

0
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,040
Help !

0
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,870
What is that ?

0
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,500
Hey !

0
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,060
Hey!

0
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,690
Anybody ?

0
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,400
Hello ?

0
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,300
Get ! Go go.
Go ! Go !

0
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,200
"Albert R. Miller."

0
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,450
Not Alan. Albert.

0
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,280
So that's it.

0
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,290
Hey ! A ship !

0
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,630
Hey ! Hey !

0
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,630
Hey ! Hey !

0
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:11,090
A ship ! Over here !

0
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,430
Hey ! Hey !

0
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:17,310
Over here ! Over here !

0
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,770
Over here !

0
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:28,440
Over here !
Over here !

0
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,110
Help me ! Help !
Right here ! Right here !

0
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,110
Help ! Look here !
Look look look!

0
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,160
S... O... S !
Please !

0
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,120
Help ! Come on!

0
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,870
Help !

0
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,380
" Happy birthday."

0
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:52,550
"The most beautiful thing in the world
is of course the world itself.

0
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:56,720
Johnny have the happiest
birthday ever. Score. Your Grandpa."

0
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,880
Ew.

0
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:07,120
Come on.

0
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,750
Come on. Come on.

0
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,880
Come on. Come on.

0
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:47,770
You wouldn't have a match...
by any chance would you ?

0
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:54,070
Oh oh oh !

0
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,510
The air got to it.

0
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,510
The air got to it !

0
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:59,600
Come on come on.
Come on.

0
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,730
I did it.
I did it.

0
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,940
Fire !

0
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:15,150
There you go!

0
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:17,240
Light it up !
Come on !

0
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,820
The time to hesitate
is through

0
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,240
Ouch !

0
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,580
Ouch !

0
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,500
No time to wallow
in the mire

0
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,750
Try now we can only lose

0
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,710
'Cause girl
we couldn't get much higher

0
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,800
Come on baby
light my fire

0
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,890
Here you go !
Here you go !

0
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:44,220
It's a signal fire !

0
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:48,730
And it spells out
S.O.S !

0
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,650
Whoa !

0
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,150
It's a meteor shower !

0
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:56,150
Fireflies !
Go ! Run !

0
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,110
You're free ! You're free !
Ouch ! Ouch !

0
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,120
Yeah !

0
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,490
Yes !

0
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,040
Look what I have created !

0
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,250
I have made fire !

0
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:11,710
I... have made fire !

0
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,600
Mmm !

0
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,480
You gotta love crab.

0
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,610
In the nick of time too.

0
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,620
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

0
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,790
Coconut milk's
a natural laxative.

0
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:50,790
Things that Gilligan
never told us.

0
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,790
Oh.

0
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,010
Pretty well-made fire
huh Wilson ?

0
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,400
So... Wilson.

0
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,700
We were en route...

0
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,870
from Memphis
for 11 and a half-hours.

0
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:28,950
About 475 miles an hour.

0
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So they think that
we are right here.

0
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,000
But...

0
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,130
we went out
of radio contact...

0
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:42,590
and flew around that storm
for about an hour.

0
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,510
So that's a distance
of what 400 miles ?

0
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,180
Four hundred miles squared.

0
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:53,190
That's 160000...

0
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:56,980
times pi- 3.14.

0
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:04,360
Five hundred and two thousand
four-

0
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:08,370
That's a search area
of 500000 square miles.

0
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:13,040
That's twice the size
of Texas.

0
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,460
They may never find us.

0
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,360
This tooth is just killing me.

0
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,910
It started out just hurting
when I bit down

0
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:51,620
but now it just hurts
all the time.

0
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,410
All the time.

0
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,170
It's-lt's a good thing there's
not much to eat around here

0
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,380
because I don't think
I could chew it.

0
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,760
Just keep sucking on all
that coconut and all that crab.

0
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,180
And just think

0
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,720
I used to avoid
going to the dentist...

0
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,930
Iike the plague.

0
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,650
I put it off every
single chance I got. But now

0
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:22,650
oh what I wouldn't give...

0
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:25,860
to have a-a dentist
right here in this cave.

0
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,450
In fact
I wish you were a dentist.

0
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,170
Yeah.

0
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,170
Dr. Wilson.

0
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,480
You wanna hear
something funny ?

0
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,150
Back home in Memphis

0
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:04,150
my dentist's name is
Dr. James Spaulding.

0
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:26,880
She's much prettier
in real life.

0
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,020
Shut up !

0
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,000
" Bakersfield" ?

0
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,010
Bakersfield !

0
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,860
This could work.

0
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,280
This could work.

0
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:40,900
Twenty-two-
Forty-four lashings.

0
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,860
Forty-four lashings.
So-

0
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,280
We have to make rope again.

0
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,580
Wilson we're gonna have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

0
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,670
Eight lashings
of these structural.

0
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,680
That's 24 apiece.

0
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,180
That'll be 100- 160.

0
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,430
Here we are today.

0
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:18,140
That gives us another month and a half
until we're into March and April

0
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:21,520
which is our best chances for
the high tides and the offshore breezes.

0
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:28,490
We need-
We need 424 feet...

0
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:32,120
of good rope plus another 50 feet
say for miscellaneous.

0
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:36,620
Round that off to
475 feet of good rope.

0
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:40,830
Now if we average
15 feet a day-

0
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,210
Plus we have to build it

0
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,010
we have to stock it
we have to launch it.

0
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:53,760
That's gonna be tight.

0
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:55,770
That is not much time.

0
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,100
But we-

0
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,810
We live and we die by time
don't we ?

0
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,900
Now let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

0
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,450
I know.

0
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:18,500
I know.

0
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:39,770
This is it.

0
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:45,310
That's all that's left.

0
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,480
I checked over the whole island
and that is all that's left.

0
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:50,490
So we're gonna be short.

0
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:55,740
Short.

0
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,790
We'll just have to make some more
out of the videotape.

0
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,800
Yes.
No we have time.

0
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,840
We do. We have time.
Look !

0
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,090
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

0
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:22,230
I know !

0
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,400
Yeah I know- I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope !

0
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,820
But- But I'm not
going back up there.

0
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,140
There there.
There you see ? Huh ?

0
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:46,810
There.
Are you happy ?

0
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:57,450
Do you have to keep bringing that up ?
Can't you just forget it ?

0
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,870
Huh ? You were right.

0
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,540
You were right.
It was a good thing that we did a test

0
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:07,080
'cause it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

0
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,250
I would have landed
on the rocks.

0
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:15,050
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.
Bled to death.

0
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:17,880
But it was the only option I had
at the time though okay ?

0
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:20,510
It was what a year ago ?

0
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,510
So let's just forget it.

0
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,020
And what is your point ?

0
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,400
Well...

0
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,400
we might just make it.

0
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,450
Did that thought
ever cross your brain ?

0
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:43,030
Well regardless I would rather take
my chance out there on the ocean...

0
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,080
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island

0
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:51,460
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball !

0
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,590
Shut you up.

0
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:09,020
Wilson ! Wilson !

0
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,860
Wilson!

0
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:21,320
Wilson !

0
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,320
Wilson !

0
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:28,000

Oh ! Oh !

01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:50,560
Never again.
Never again never again.

0
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,770
You're okay.
You okay ? Yeah.

0
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:14,880
Yeah I know you.

0
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,380
I know you.

01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:25,600

Okay.

0
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,580
You still awake ?

0
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:17,210
Me too.

0
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,800
You scared ?

0
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,930
Me too.

0
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:52,680
Okay.
Here we go Wilson.

0
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,930
You don't have to worry
about anything.

0
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:58,180
I'll do all the paddling.

0
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,230
You just hang on.

0
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:49,400
Not yet !
Hold on !

0
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:03,330
Not yet !
Not yet !

0
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,670
Not yet !

0
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:13,420
Stand by Wilson !

0
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:16,300
Hold on !
Hold on Wilson !

0
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:36,780
I think we did it !

0
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,080
I think we did it !

0
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,080
Wilson !

0
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,290
I think we did it !

0
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,840
Oh ! They're gone !

0
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:29,970
I don't know why !

0
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:55,140
Where's Wilson ?

0
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,980
Where's Wilson ?

0
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:01,980
Wilson where are you ?

0
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:05,530
Wilson !

0
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:10,950
Wilson !

0
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,280
Wilson!

0
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,440
Wilson !

0
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,940
I'm comin'!

0
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:48,690
Wilson !

0
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:11,180
Wilson !

0
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,720
Wilson-

0
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:21,020
Wilson !

0
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:29,440
Wilson ! Wilson !

0
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,790
Wilson !

0
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:49,260
Wilson!

0
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:51,630
I'm sorry !

0
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,390
I'm sorry Wilson!

0
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:58,010
Wilson I'm sorry !

0
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,600
I'm sorry!

0
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,850
Wilson!

0
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,020
I can't!

0
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,020
Wilson !

0
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,740
Wilson !

0
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,980
I'm- I'm sorry.

0
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,910
I'm sorry.

0
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:01,700
I'm sorry.

0
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,580
Kelly.

0
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,960
Kelly.

0
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,290
Kelly.

0
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:24,100
Hello ?
Oh how are you ?

0
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:27,970
Okay.

0
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:12,190
Forty-five minutes.

0
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:14,980
One Dr. Pepper.

0
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:17,230
Two cups of ice.

0
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:19,230
I like ice.

0
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:23,860
Well here's the drill.

0
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:26,910
Um plane pulls in
we get off

0
01:48:26,990 --> 01:48:29,740
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

0
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,460
Fred Smith
will say a few words.

0
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:37,000
All you have to do is smile
and say "thank you."

0
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,510
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

0
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:45,050
She's actually gonna
be there huh ?

0
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:48,760
Well that's what
we have arranged.

0
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:50,600
I mean if you're sure
you wanna do that.

0
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:52,770
Oh yeah yeah.
Yes.

0
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:59,150
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

0
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:02,860
What in the world
am I gonna say to her ?

0
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:10,160
Chuck Kelly had
to let you go.

0
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,410
You know?

0
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:15,250
She thought you were dead.

0
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:17,380
And we buried you.

0
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:23,170
We had a funeral and a coffin
and a gravestone.

0
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:25,220
The whole thing.

0
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,390
You had a coffin ?

0
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:33,060
What was in it ?

0
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:37,100
Well everybody put
something in.

0
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:41,940
You know just a cell phone
or a beeper some pictures.

0
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:44,070
I put in some Elvis CDs.

0
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:48,950
So you had my funeral...

0
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:54,040
and then you had
Mary's funeral.

0
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:02,500
Stan I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

0
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:08,760
I should've been there for you
and I wasn't.

0
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:15,100
I'm so sorry.

0
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:17,640
Four years ago

0
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:21,770
the FedEx family lost
five of our sons.

0
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:24,940
That was a terrible
and tragic day.

0
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:29,160
But today
one of those sons

0
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:33,120
Chuck Noland
has been returned to us.

0
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,330
Chuck welcome home.

0
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:49,010
Just moments ago Fred Smith
welcomed home Chuck Noland.

0
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:52,470
- How about it Michelle ?
- It's such an incredible
and amazing story...

0
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:56,220
- to comeback from the dead.
- Well it's so amazing that
Smith himself welcomed him back.

0
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:59,940
And Fred acknowledged that
"While time waits for no man

0
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:02,940
we take time to pause
to honor one of our own. "

0
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:05,270
Now that's an expensive pause.

0
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,330
I'm-l'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

0
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:18,200
No you're in
the right place.

0
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:22,630
You probably don't remember me.
I actually did root canal on you
about five years ago.

0
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:24,840
Jim Spaulding referred you.

0
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,710
Oh yeah yeah.

0
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,560
I'm Kelly's husband.

0
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:39,730
Jerry Lovett.

0
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:42,850
Kelly wanted-

0
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,900
Kelly wanted to be here-

0
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:51,400
Look this is very hard
for everyone.

0
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:54,030
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

0
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:00,790
Kelly uh-

0
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,380
She's had it rough.

0
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:08,130
First when she thought
she lost you

0
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:10,130
and now dealing
with all of this.

0
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:13,590
It's-lt's confusing.
It's very emotional for her.

0
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:15,600
She's-

0
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:20,770
She's... sort of lost.

0
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:25,440
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

0
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:33,400
Anyway uh

0
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:35,410
I'm sorry that-

0
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,720
Okay people let's go.

0
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,090
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

0
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:39,720
You're definitely
gonna have to go down to the DMV.

0
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:42,350
Okay Maynard let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

0
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:44,430
- I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...
- I know.

0
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,440
with the accountants
and the attorneys all right ?

0
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,020
I will see you
bright and early in the morning.

0
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:53,360
- Hey Chuck welcome home. We love you.
- Becca I need to speak to you.

0
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:57,070
You know Chuck we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin' now.

0
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:59,070
Take care.

0
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:04,160
- Good night.
- Good night.

0
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:09,710
You got everything
you need ? Okay.

0
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:11,710
Well if you need anything
just sign for it

0
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:14,050
and I'll see you
in the morning.

0
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:16,920
Get some sleep okay ?
We got another big day tomorrow.

0
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:19,470
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

0
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,390
- Bring you back to life man.
- Bye Chuck.

0
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:26,680
- Take care now.
- Tomorrow.

0
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:29,020
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

0
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:15,790
How long are you
gonna be man ?

0
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:21,050
Well...

0
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:24,260
- how long will that buy me ?
- About ten minutes.

0
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:50,500
I'm awake.

0
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,620
I saw your taxi drive up.

0
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:57,080
Get in here
out of the rain.

0
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:06,390
I saw you
down at the hub today

0
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:08,760
so I know you were down there.

0
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,080
Let me get you a towel.

0
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,920
They're sleeping.

0
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:48,890
If you come in
I'll make you some coffee.

0
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,320
It's a nice house.

0
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,320
Yeah we got
a nice mortgage too.

0
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,790
What's your daughter's name ?

0
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:19,420
Katie.

0
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,460
Katie.

0
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,880
- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.

0
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:44,110
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

0
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:57,330
We have a pro football team now
but they're in Nashville ?

0
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:07,970
Um yeah. Oh my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

0
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:12,220
First they were the Oilers
and now they're the Titans.

0
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:14,970
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans ?

0
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:16,970
Yeah.

0
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,980
But that's not all.

0
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:22,020
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

0
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:24,690
- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.

0
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:28,320
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

0
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:34,030
I got whole milk
2% and nonfat.

0
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,370
I don't have any half-and-half
and that's what you like.

0
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:39,540
That'll do fine.

0
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,850
What happened to you
becoming a professor ?

0
01:59:56,850 --> 02:00:00,690
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett ?

0
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:06,320
When you um-

0
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:09,240
When your plane went down

0
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,530
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

0
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:16,910
I think about
taking it up again though.

0
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:31,010
I came out here
to give you this.

0
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,640
Oh my God.

0
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,640
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

0
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:43,020
And l uh
I kept the picture.

0
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:46,270
It was all faded anyway.

0
02:00:47,690 --> 02:00:50,490
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

0
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:53,610
That's a family heirloom
and it should stay in your family.

0
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:06,460
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

0
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:11,210
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

0
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:14,880
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

0
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,560
So here's where
that ship found you.

0
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:26,060
You drifted about 500 miles.

0
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:28,360
This is where
your island was

0
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:31,780
about 600 miles
south of the Cook lslands.

0
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,610
And these are
the search grids.

0
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:38,570
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

0
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:49,710
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

0
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:54,550
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

0
02:01:58,390 --> 02:02:00,350
I wanna show you something.

0
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:04,350
Come here.

0
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:15,950
This is-
This is our car.

0
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,240
You kept our car.

0
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:25,710
All right now
this is weird.

0
02:02:34,170 --> 02:02:36,340
It's a good car.

0
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:38,760
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

0
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:41,470
Two very nice memories.

0
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:43,600
Oh that trip
down to the Gulf yeah.

0
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:48,100
So can I drive it ?

0
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:50,100
It's your car.

0
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:00,990
That's good 'cause my-
my taxi's gone.

0
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,460
Um-

0
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,460
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

0
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:36,400
You think you're gonna
have more kids ?

0
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,400
I don't know.

0
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:41,320
It's kind of confusing
right now.

0
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:44,120
Well you should.

0
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:46,160
I mean really
you should.

0
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:50,540
I would.

0
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:54,630
So what now ?

0
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:59,590
I don't know.

0
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:04,010
I really don't know.

0
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:18,650
You said
you'd be right back.

0
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:25,830
I'm so sorry.

0
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:29,660
Me too.

0
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,530
Chuck !

0
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:47,120
Chuck !

0
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:49,120
Chuck !

0
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:08,340
I always knew you were alive.

0
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:11,060
I knew it.

0
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,310
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that-

0
02:06:13,390 --> 02:06:15,390
that I had to let you go.

0
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:19,730
I love you.

0
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:21,650
You're the love of my life.

0
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:26,150
I love you too Kelly.

0
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:29,700
More than you'll ever know.

0
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:32,640
Chuck ?

0
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:42,360
You have to go home.

0
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:32,700
We both had done
the math and-

0
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:37,490
Kelly added it all up.

0
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:41,080
She knew she had
to let me go.

0
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:45,540
I added it up
knew that I'd-

0
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:47,550
I'd lost her.

0
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:51,630
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

0
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:57,260
I was gonna die there

0
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:59,270
totally alone.

0
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:08,570
I mean I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

0
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:14,610
The only choice I had

0
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:19,620
the only thing
I could control...

0
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:25,170
was when and how...

0
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:27,170
and where
that was gonna happen.

0
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:31,760
So... I made a rope.

0
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:37,680
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

0
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:43,390
But I had to test it
you know ?

0
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:46,400
Of course.
You know me.

0
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:50,270
And the weight of the log...

0
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:53,650
snapped the limb
of the tree.

0
02:09:53,690 --> 02:09:55,660
So l-l-

0
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:58,370
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

0
02:09:58,450 --> 02:10:01,370
I had power over nothing.

0
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:13,420
And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

0
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:19,510
I knew...

0
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,890
somehow...

0
02:10:21,970 --> 02:10:24,310
that I had to stay alive.

0
02:10:25,890 --> 02:10:27,850
Somehow.

0
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,190
I had to keep breathing

0
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:35,820
even though there was
no reason to hope.

0
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:41,660
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

0
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:49,380
So that's what I did.

0
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:52,000
I stayed alive.

0
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:54,010
I kept breathing.

0
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:58,510
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong

0
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:00,510
because the tide...

0
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:05,140
came in
gave me a sail.

0
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:11,730
And now here I am.

0
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:18,070
I'm back...

0
02:11:18,110 --> 02:11:20,660
in Memphis talking to you.

0
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:25,290
I have ice in my glass.

0
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:34,380
And I've lost her
all over again.

0
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:44,600
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

0
02:11:49,730 --> 02:11:53,150
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

0
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,450
And I know
what I have to do now.

0
02:12:05,370 --> 02:12:07,410
I gotta keep breathing.

0
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,580
Because tomorrow
the sun will rise.

0
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:16,300
Who knows what the tide
could bring ?

0
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:33,860
I gave a letter to the postman

0
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:35,860
He put it in his sack

0
02:12:37,650 --> 02:12:40,820
Bright and early
next morning

0
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:43,570
He brought my letter back

0
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:45,580
She wrote upon it

0
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:47,580
Return to sender

0
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:50,960
Address unknown

0
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:55,040
No such number

0
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:23,860
Hello !

0
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:30,200
Hello !

0
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:40,130
FedEx !

0
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:50,780
- You look lost.
- I do ?

0
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:53,120
Where are you headed ?

0
02:14:56,830 --> 02:14:58,790
Well I was just about
to figure that out.

0
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,750
Well that's 83 South.

0
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:06,880
And this road here will
hook you up with l-40 East.

0
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:09,220
If you turn right

0
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:12,970
that'll take you to
Amarillo Flagstaff

0
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:14,970
California.

0
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:18,100
And if you head back
that direction

0
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:21,190
you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.

0
02:15:23,230 --> 02:15:25,150
I got it.

0
02:15:25,230 --> 02:15:27,450
All right then.

0
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:31,910
Good luck cowboy.

0
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:33,790
- Thank you.

0
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:43,920
