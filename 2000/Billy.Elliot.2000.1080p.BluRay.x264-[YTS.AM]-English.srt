5
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,264
No!

6
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,788
Grandma.

7
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,667
Your eggs.

8
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,839
It's Billy.

9
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,344
Come on.

10
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,029
Fuck!

11
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,576
You been playing my
records, you little twat!

12
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,536
I never played naught.

13
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,915
Nob head!

14
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,920
If Dad knew you smoked that stuff,
he'd go mental.

15
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,755
What? Fuck off, will you?

16
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,924
Twat.

17
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,647
Here we go, Dad! Come on, man.

18
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,233
Dad!

19
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,861
Hurry up, Dad, man. We'll be late.

20
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,156
I'm telling you, the whole frigging world's
gonna be on that picket line this morning.

21
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,326
Oi! You tidy our room. Dad!

22
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,537
There's not much of this coal left.

23
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,456
It's fine.
We'll be digging it up again next month.

24
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,291
Don't kid yourself.

25
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,545
I'm not waiting for youse.

26
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,755
Tony. Tony!

27
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,967
See you down the picket line, Dad.

28
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,138
Leave it, Billy.

29
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,310
Mom would've let us.

30
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,837
Your 50 pence is on the fridge.

31
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,903
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!

32
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,698
Scab! Scab! Scab!

33
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,171
Are you sure you're not going to come?

34
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,799
Am I fuck. It's a right
load of old bollocks.

35
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,883
No, it's not.

36
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,677
It's a load of shite, kicking people in.

37
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,679
Anyway, I don't know why you bother.

38
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,264
- I'm good at it.
- You're shite.

39
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,016
Look at them gloves, man.
They went out with the ark.

40
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,184
They're me dad's, these.

41
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,436
Exactly.

42
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,109
Right, lads. Listen up here.

43
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,403
Hold it! Oi, oi! Here!

44
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:32,284
Now, because they're using downstairs
as a soup kitchen for the striking miners,

45
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,371
I'm going to let Mrs Wilkinson

46
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,291
use the bottom end of the boxing hall
for her ballet lessons.

47
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,002
So no hanky-panky. Understood?

48
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,462
Yes.

49
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,589
Elliot, you're late.

50
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,508
Get changed and get in here.

51
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,054
All right then, lads.

52
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,974
Now, give it all you got! Round one.

53
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,481
Well, don't just stand there, Elliot!

54
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,195
No! Not again!

55
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,490
This is man-to-man combat,
not a bloody tea dance.

56
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,161
What're you doing, man? Hit him!

57
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,747
Greavesy, he's just pissing about.
Now, get stuck in and give him a belt.

58
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,666
He's like a fanny in a fit.

59
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,668
Billy, hit him!

60
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,465
Jesus Christ, Billy Elliot!

61
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,051
You're a disgrace to them gloves,
your father,

62
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,679
and the traditions of this boxing hall.

63
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,556
You owe us 50 pence.

64
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,144
Liberace, will you give it a rest?

65
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,148
Billy, punch bag.

66
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,243
You're not going until you do it properly.

67
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,665
Give these to Mrs Wilkinson
and her dance class when you've finished.

68
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,084
I'll see you next week.

69
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,753
Okay, girls.

70
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,671
Left hand on the bar.

71
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,715
Thank you, Mr Braithwaite. And...

72
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,468
Pretty arms.

73
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,473
Bottoms in.

74
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,060
Where are you looking, Susan?

75
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,897
Lift. Feel the music. Feel it.

76
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,150
In time, Debbie, please.

77
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,197
And one, and two, and three,

78
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,574
and four, and five,

79
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,077
six, seven, eight.

80
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,080
And one, and two, and three,

81
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,540
and four, five.

82
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,836
And hold.

83
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,547
Hold it.

84
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,843
Support yourselves! Don't look at me.
Look ahead!

85
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,264
Where's your confidence? Come on.

86
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,435
And down.

87
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,233
Connie.

88
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,944
Oh, God.

89
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,322
And, Debbie, eyes front.

90
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:21,287
And five, and six, and seven, and stop.
For God's sake.

91
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,830
Thank you, Mr Braithwaite.

92
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,499
Right into the centre, girls, please.

93
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,173
Miss? Miss, the keys.

94
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,508
Not now.

95
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,470
Right, Mr Braithwaite.
The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.

96
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,308
Fat chance. Ready, and...

97
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,645
Port de bras forward,

98
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,939
and up.

99
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:53,068
Port de bras forward, and up.

100
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,113
- Why don't you join in?
- Port de bras forward.

101
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,157
- Nah.
- And up.

102
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,076
Port de bras forward.

103
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,247
And up, and hold.

104
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,210
And three, and four.
And, Debbie, straight leg.

105
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,962
Seven and eight.

106
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:17,509
And one, and two, and three,
and four, and five.

107
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,346
Boots off. Seven and eight.

108
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,681
- What size are you?
- Miss, what about the keys?

109
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,391
Into the centre.

110
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,688
Go on. I dare you.

111
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,566
Prepare.

112
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,071
And one, and two, and three,

113
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:41,116
and four, and five, and six, and...

114
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,661
And eight, and hold.

115
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
Hold it.

116
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,001
Hold it.

117
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,963
Hold it.

118
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,050
What have we got here, then?

119
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,513
Heel out. Drop your hip.

120
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,476
Nice, straight leg.

121
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,729
Good arch.

122
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,481
Turn that leg out.

123
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,986
Right. Class dismissed.

124
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,615
Home time. Debbie, get the 50p's.

125
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,333
- You owe me 50 pence.
- No, I don't!

126
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,002
You do.
Why don't you bring it along next week?

127
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,671
Can't. I'm going to boxing.

128
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,340
- But you're crap at boxing.
- No, I'm not!

129
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,675
Shut up.

130
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,178
Thought you enjoyed it.

131
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,018
Please yourself, darling.

132
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,980
He was your mom's favorite,
was Fred Astaire.

133
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,858
We used to watch him
at the Palace Picture House,

134
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,195
and then dance round
the front room like lunatics.

135
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,197
Marvelous!

136
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,409
Mind, they used to say
I could've been a professional.

137
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,662
Come on, Grandma. Not now.

138
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,872
Oh!

139
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,198
Grandma!

140
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,327
It's this one here!

141
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,957
Grandma! It's over here!

142
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,587
Tony, do you ever think about death?

143
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,339
Fuck off!

144
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,595
Night-night, then.

145
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,479
Plenty of boys do ballet, you know?

146
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,023
Do they now? What boys do ballet?

147
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,943
Nobody around here, but plenty of men do.

148
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,821
- Poofs.
- Not necessarily poofs.

149
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,573
Who, like?

150
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,242
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He's not a poof.

151
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,910
He's as fit as an athlete.

152
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,704
Bet he couldn't beat Daley Thompson.

153
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,331
Maybe not in a race, but in stamina.

154
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,624
Why don't you come tomorrow?

155
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,334
- You can just watch.
- I can't.

156
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,421
Gotta go to boxing, haven't I?

157
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,339
Please yourself, then.

158
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,717
See you around.

159
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,511
Aye, see you. Ta-ra.

160
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,235
Right, lads. Look sharp.
Everybody, out!

161
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,706
Turn, turn, and stop.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

162
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,000
Arms are in fifth.

163
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,004
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Turn, turn, and stop.

164
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,300
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Where are those arms?

165
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,093
- I don't know what to do.
- Follow the others.

166
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,805
Shut up, Debbie! One, two, three.
One, two, three.

167
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,516
Nice pretty arms. And stop.

168
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,897
See? I told you it takes loads of practice.

169
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,065
Debbie.

170
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,399
What, Mom?

171
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,151
What do you call me?

172
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,277
Miss.

173
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,695
Shove off.

174
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,533
So, do we get the pleasure
of your company next week?

175
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,496
It's just... I feel like a right sissy.

176
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,457
Well, don't act like one. Fifty p, please.

177
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,256
If you're not coming again,
give us your shoes.

178
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,470
Nah. You're all right.

179
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,721
Right.

180
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,580
What are you doing,
going around here like creeping Jesus?

181
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,748
Naught.

182
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,127
We found your nana in the Spar stores.
Where have you been?

183
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,003
Boxing. Where do you think?

184
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,463
What're you doing?

185
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,382
I forgot me gloves.

186
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,134
They were my dad's gloves.

187
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,178
You better take better care of them, okay?

188
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,415
Copy down that diagram.
You only have five minutes left.

189
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,231
Hurry. This way.

190
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,697
You go to ballet every week?

191
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,073
Yeah, but don't tell.

192
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,283
Why do you need to take lessons?

193
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,161
Why do you think? To get better, you divvy.

194
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,955
- Do you got to wear a tutu?
- Fuck off.

195
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,374
They're only meant for lasses.

196
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,126
I wear me shorts.

197
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,795
You won't ask for a tutu?

198
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,213
What for?

199
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,632
To dance in.

200
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,966
I'd look a right dickhead.

201
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,384
I think you'd look wicked.

202
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,265
Come on.

203
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,892
I don't know why you're looking at that.

204
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,604
You can't take that out on a junior ticket.

205
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,991
Come on!

206
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,339
See you, then.

207
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,154
Okay, Billy Elliot, into the centre.

208
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,324
Right, now I want you to
watch carefully, girls.

209
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,034
First, arabesque.

210
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,870
Drop your shoulders.

211
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,998
Look forward, beyond your fingertips.

212
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,172
There!

213
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,676
Right. Spin it, Mr Braithwaite. Spin it.

214
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,263
Come on. Spin it! Now, focus!

215
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,433
Look at yourselves! Look in the mirror!

216
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,859
Christ almighty! What was that?

217
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,736
What's going on?

218
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,946
Nothing.

219
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,866
Prepare, one and two.

220
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,619
Strong position. Weight on both legs.

221
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,622
And, pirouette.

222
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,957
And down.

223
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,835
Up you get.

224
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,968
Find a place on that bloody wall,

225
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,887
and focus on that spot.

226
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:51,309
Then whip your head round,
and come back to that spot. Prepare.

227
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,354
One, and two, and...

228
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,480
Fuck it.

229
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,315
Have you got the spot?

230
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,112
Prepare!

231
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,074
- Prepare.
- Prepare.

232
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,827
Go!

233
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,871
Go! Go!

234
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,500
Go! Go, Billy!

235
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,593
What have I told you about that arm?

236
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,972
Right. Back to the bar.

237
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,279
You look like a right wanker to me, son.

238
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:22,692
Listen, Jackie.

239
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,818
Listen, Jackie.

240
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,321
If it was just the 50 pence a session,
you know,

241
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,948
I can do without it.
I don't do it for the money.

242
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,367
- What are you talking about?
- The boxing, man.

243
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,995
I haven't seen hide nor hair
of your Billy for months.

244
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,123
I was gonna say something,
but I thought it might be embarrassing.

245
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,626
First I knew about it.
He's never got the gloves off.

246
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,463
Send him round to my house.
I'll sharp knock some sense into him.

247
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,471
Scab! Scab!

248
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,520
Step open and balancé, balancé, balancé.

249
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,314
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!

250
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,237
Right. Let's do it again.

251
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,578
Open, and lift your chest.
Right. Let's do it again.

252
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:19,499
Thank you, Mr Braithwaite.
Step open. Open your arms. Do it.

253
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,420
Pay attention. Arms. Like this. All right?

254
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,925
Thank you, Mr Braithwaite.
Step really open!

255
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,177
Powerful! Proud!

256
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,934
You're not concentrating.

257
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,185
Yes, I am concentrating.

258
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,187
You're not even trying.

259
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,857
Can we have a go of it, Miss?

260
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,818
Let's do it again.

261
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,409
Listen, have you noticed
anything weird about our Billy lately?

262
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,244
What are you after, like, a list?

263
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,331
Aye, aye.

264
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,840
Got enough food there, scab?

265
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,885
What're you doing?

266
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,511
Scabs eat well.

267
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,471
You're me best mate.

268
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:19,058
First rule of a union, Gary.
You never cross a picket line.

269
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,566
We're all fucked if you forget that!

270
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,401
We're fucked anyway.

271
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,780
In a speech to Tory MPs yesterday,

272
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,699
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

273
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,536
referred to members of the striking
National Union of Mineworkers

274
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,496
as "the enemy within".

275
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,542
The speech comes following
several months of violent clashes

276
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,253
between police officers
and striking miners...

277
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,798
- See you, then.
- Wait. Your breakfast...

278
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,761
What the hell's he up to?

279
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,607
One, two, three, pas de bourrée.

280
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,527
And a one, two, three, and a turn.

281
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:15,365
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

282
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:19,160
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

283
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,997
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

284
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,793
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

285
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,463
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

286
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:35,093
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

287
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,680
You, out! Now!

288
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,848
I beg your pardon?

289
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,688
Please, Miss.

290
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,399
Don't.

291
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,911
All right, which way are we facing?
Come on.

292
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,416
And a one, two, three, pas de bourrée.

293
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,459
Ballet.

294
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,128
What's wrong with ballet?

295
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,422
What's "wrong" with ballet?

296
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,424
It's perfectly normal.

297
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,509
"Perfectly normal"?

298
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,762
I used to go to ballet.

299
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,389
See?

300
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,683
Aye, for your nana.

301
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,311
For girls. Not for lads, Billy.

302
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,105
Lads do football or

303
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,275
boxing or

304
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,069
wrestling!

305
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,740
Not frigging ballet.

306
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,078
What lads do wrestling?

307
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,248
Don't start, Billy.

308
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,792
I don't see what's wrong with it.

309
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,919
You know perfectly well
what's wrong with it.

310
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,088
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

311
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,050
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you bloody well do.

312
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,303
Who do you think I am?

313
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,598
You know quite nicely!

314
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,726
What?

315
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,646
What are you trying to say, Dad?

316
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,360
You're asking for a hiding, Son.

317
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,195
No, I'm not. Honest.

318
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,030
You are, Billy. Billy!

319
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,782
It's not just poofs, Dad.

320
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,451
Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes.

321
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,704
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He was a ballet dancer.

322
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,291
Wayne Sleep?

323
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,501
Aye.

324
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,045
Listen, Son,

325
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,507
from now on you can forget
about the fucking ballet.

326
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,259
You can forget about the fucking boxing,
as well.

327
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,721
I'm busting my ass for those 50 pences,
and you're... No!

328
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,642
From now on, you stay here
and look after your nana. Got it?

329
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,729
Good.

330
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,403
They used to say
I could have been a professional dancer

331
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,613
- if I'd had the training.
- Will you shut up?

332
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,577
I hate you!

333
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,538
You're a bastard!

334
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,256
Get off!

335
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,676
Billy! Billy!

336
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,011
Billy!

337
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:33,915
Hello.

338
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,543
My dad will kill me if he knows I'm here.

339
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,962
He stopped you coming to classes.

340
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,633
It's not his fault, Miss.

341
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,593
That's all right with you, is it?

342
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,262
I suppose so.

343
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,640
You should stand up to him.

344
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,558
You don't know what he's like.

345
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,436
Well, that blows it.

346
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,647
Blows what, Miss?

347
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,940
Debbie?

348
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,861
I've heard a lot about you.

349
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,239
Durham's little Gene Kelly.

350
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,991
Your dad work down the pit, then?

351
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,535
Yeah.

352
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,787
Must be hard for the family,
being out on strike.

353
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,414
He is out on strike, isn't he?

354
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,582
Of course.

355
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,960
I shouldn't worry. It won't last long.

356
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,294
Tom, don't.

357
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,088
If they had a ballot,
they'd be back tomorrow.

358
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,216
It's just a few bloody commies,
stirring things up.

359
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,885
Let's face it.
They haven't got a leg to stand on.

360
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,345
Who doesn't?

361
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,432
The miners. It stands
to reason, doesn't it?

362
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,810
Some pits are just uneconomical.

363
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,938
If it costs more money to pay everybody
to dig the coal out

364
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,857
than you get for the coal when you sell it,
what does that tell you?

365
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,401
Don't know.

366
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,404
Well, you wanna think about that,
don't you, son?

367
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,530
Tom.

368
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,533
If it was up to me,
I'd shut the lot of them down tomorrow.

369
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,951
For God's sake.

370
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,788
What do you do, Mr Wilkinson?

371
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,374
He's been made redundant.

372
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,756
I thought he was gonna hit me or something.

373
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,468
Don't be silly.
He's just under a lot of pressure.

374
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:13,264
That's what Mom says.
I think it's because he drinks too much.

375
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,266
Does he drink too much, like?

376
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,060
He's always pissed. Once he pissed himself.

377
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,395
Your dad?

378
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,024
'Cause he's unhappy and that.
'Cause they sleep in separate beds.

379
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,525
Why do they sleep in separate beds?

380
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,652
So they can't have sex.

381
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,321
Do they not have sex, like?

382
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,408
Dad did it with this woman from work,
but they don't think I know.

383
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,872
Do you miss your mom, then?

384
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:43,461
Don't really miss her as such.
It's more like just feeling sad.

385
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:47,256
Especially when I remember her
all of a sudden.

386
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,134
When I forgot that she was dead and that.

387
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,387
What about your mom?
Does she not have sex?

388
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,766
No, she's unfulfilled.
That's why she does dancing.

389
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,352
She does dancing instead of sex?

390
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,895
Your family's weird.

391
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,647
No, they're not.

392
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,235
They are, though. They're mental.

393
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,161
Get off!

394
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,517
See? You're a nutter, you.

395
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,937
Debbie! It's time for Billy to go home!

396
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,899
Come on, Billy. I'll drop
you off at the corner.

397
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,067
I'll see you, Debbie.

398
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,670
Okay, then.

399
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,642
Miss, what have I blown?

400
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,818
This'll sound strange, Billy,
but for some time now

401
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,362
I've been thinking of the
Royal Ballet School.

402
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,658
Aren't you a bit old, Miss?

403
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,077
No, not me. You!

404
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,121
I'm the bloody teacher.

405
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,208
They hold auditions in Newcastle.

406
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,128
I'd never be good enough.
I hardly know aught.

407
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,797
No. Look, they're not interested in
how much ballet you know.

408
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,300
They teach you that.
That's why they're a ballet school.

409
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:58,429
It's how you move and
how you express yourself that's important.

410
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,722
Express what?

411
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,892
I think you're good enough to go for it.

412
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,608
It would mean an awful lot of hard work.

413
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,234
But I'm banned.

414
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,320
Then maybe I should have a word with him.

415
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,613
No, Miss!

416
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,448
I could teach you on your own, if you want.

417
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,617
We couldn't afford it.

418
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,452
I'm not doing it for the money, Billy.

419
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,912
But what about Dad?

420
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:23,954
He doesn't need to know.

421
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,248
- What about me boxing and that?
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Billy!

422
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,793
If you want to piss about with your
little mates, that's fine with me.

423
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,795
All right, don't lose your blob.

424
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,380
"Blob"?

425
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,387
So we could do it private-like?

426
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,932
Just you and me.

427
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,857
Miss, you don't fancy me, do you?

428
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,905
No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don't.
Now, piss off.

429
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,118
Piss off yourself.

430
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,999
See you Monday, then.

431
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,106
You coming in or what?

432
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,190
What are you doing?

433
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,317
Nothing. Just dressing up.

434
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,865
Whose dress is that?

435
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,199
Come on.

436
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,127
- Whose dress is that?
- It's me sister's.

437
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,297
- Did she give you it?
- She doesn't know.

438
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,924
Do you wanna try?
You can have one of me mom's.

439
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,343
Nah. You're all right.

440
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,143
What're you doing that for?

441
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm just trying it on.

442
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,149
Christ.

443
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,192
Come here.

444
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,196
Stay still.

445
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,075
There.

446
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,452
Won't we get in trouble?

447
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,330
Don't be stupid. Me dad
does it all the time.

448
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,582
He dresses up in your mom's clothes?

449
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,168
Only when he thinks everybody's out.

450
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,795
Have you got a tutu yet?

451
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,383
Do you think being a ballet dancer
would be better than being a miner?

452
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,968
I don't know.

453
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:46,847
It's just, I've got this audition
in Newcastle in a couple of weeks.

454
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,767
- What for?
- To go to ballet school.

455
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,770
Ballet school? Is that in Newcastle?

456
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,021
London.

457
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,816
You'd have to move
with your Tony and everybody?

458
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,985
No. By meself.

459
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,195
That's a bit steep.

460
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,780
Can't you be a ballet dancer here, like?

461
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,323
Don't be stupid!

462
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:06,951
So, when you going there, then?

463
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,787
I don't know. I haven't even got in yet.

464
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,914
What does your dad say?

465
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,250
He doesn't know.

466
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,628
Fucking hell. Are you
not going to tell him?

467
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,754
Not yet, anyway.

468
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,549
He might be quite pleased about it.
He could rent your room out.

469
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,468
He couldn't. What about our Tony?

470
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,805
What do you reckon?

471
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,477
I think you shouldn't bother.

472
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,312
Why not?

473
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,855
I'd miss you.

474
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,149
Fucking hell.

475
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,139
Brought your things?

476
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,977
I don't know if they're right, Miss.

477
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,355
If they're special to you, they're right.

478
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,649
What are they for?

479
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,027
To give us some ideas for a dance.

480
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,279
Come on, then. Let's see them.

481
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,021
What's that?

482
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,106
It's a letter.

483
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,357
I can see it's a letter.

484
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,528
It's me mom's.

485
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,657
She wrote it for when I was 18,
but I opened it.

486
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,000
Here.

487
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,730
"To my son Billy."

488
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,568
"Dear Billy."

489
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,322
"I know I must seem
like a distant memory to you,"

490
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,408
"which is probably a good thing."

491
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,453
"It will have been a long time,"

492
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,540
"and I will have missed seeing you grow."

493
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,751
"Missed you crying, laughing,"

494
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,503
"and shouting."

495
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,883
"I will have missed telling you off."

496
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:13,178
"But please know that I was always there."

497
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,518
"With you through everything."

498
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,895
"With you through everything."

499
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,898
"I always will be."

500
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,735
"And I am proud to have known you,"

501
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,114
"and I am proud that you were mine."

502
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,409
"Always be yourself."

503
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,620
"I love you forever."

504
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,084
"Mom."

505
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,140
She must've been a very special woman,
your mother.

506
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,185
No, she was just me mom.

507
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,189
I brought tape and all.

508
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,233
What is it?

509
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,110
I Love to Boogie.

510
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,279
It's one of our Tony's.

511
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,473
Spin it! Go on!

512
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,659
And tap. Go!

513
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,178
Grandma, tea time.

514
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,902
Where are you going?

515
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,071
Go back to sleep.

516
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,489
It's 4:00.

517
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,521
You weren't thinking of taking it with you?

518
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,691
If you just wanna stand round
getting the shit kicked out of you,

519
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,193
that's your funeral.

520
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,028
But some of us are
ready to fight back for once.

521
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,614
They're already after you,
for fuck's sake.

522
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,783
You're no good to us in jail.

523
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,493
I don't plan on getting caught.

524
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:05,786
What's going on?

525
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,329
You, get back to bed!

526
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,539
Both of you!

527
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,333
Fuck you.

528
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,212
Put it down.

529
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,338
You gonna stop me?

530
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,547
I'm warning you.

531
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,883
You haven't got it in you.
You're finished!

532
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,927
Since Mom died
you're nothing but a useless twat.

533
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,762
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

534
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,347
Stop it!

535
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,175
What the fuck are you looking at?

536
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,471
You haven't been practicing.

537
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:12,477
Prepare. One, two. And one, and two...

538
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,147
Get up.

539
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,608
Miss, I can't do it.

540
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,529
That's because you're not concentrating.

541
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,865
I am concentrating.

542
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,700
You're not even trying!

543
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,076
I am, Miss!

544
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,202
Do it again.

545
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,287
Can't.

546
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,875
You do it again.

547
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,259
No!

548
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,019
Shit!

549
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:17,375
I'm sorry.

550
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,921
It's all right for you.
It's not you who has to do it!

551
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,005
I know.

552
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,509
You don't know anything!
What do you know in your posh house

553
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,427
with your husband that pisses himself?

554
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,348
You're the same as everybody else.
All you want is to tell me what to do.

555
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,682
Now wait a minute!

556
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,353
Look, I don't wanna do
your stupid fucking audition!

557
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,980
You only want me to do it
for your own benefit!

558
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,065
Look, Billy...

559
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,525
Because you're a failure!

560
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,860
Don't you dare talk to me like that!

561
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:46,154
You don't even have
a proper dancing school!

562
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,323
You're stuck in some crummy boxing hall.

563
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,742
Don't pick on me 'cause
you fucked up your own life!

564
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,789
Can I put a tape on, Miss?

565
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,000
All right, if you must.

566
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,710
It's cush, isn't it?

567
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,548
So, is there a story, then, Miss?

568
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,176
Of course.

569
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:36,765
It's about a woman
who's captured by an evil magician.

570
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,850
Sounds crap.

571
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,812
And this woman, this beautiful woman,

572
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,231
is forced to be a swan.

573
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,944
Except for a few hours every night

574
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,905
when she becomes alive.

575
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,408
When she becomes real again.

576
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,206
And then one night,

577
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,084
she meets this young prince,

578
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,129
and he falls in love with her.

579
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,967
And she realizes,

580
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:18,515
this is the one thing that will allow her
to become a real woman once more.

581
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,602
So then what happens?

582
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,647
He promises to marry her and then
goes off with someone else, of course.

583
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,733
So she has to be a swan for good?

584
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,443
She dies.

585
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,696
Because the prince didn't love her?

586
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,073
Come on. It's time to go.

587
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,784
It's only a ghost story.

588
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,663
Come on!

589
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,277
No! No. No.

590
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,946
It's me.

591
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,325
It's Billy.

592
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,330
Little one.

593
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,190
Oi! Little one.

594
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,526
What have I told you
about drinking out of the bottle?

595
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,153
Sorry, Mom.

596
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:06,372
Well, put it back.

597
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,606
One, lift and reach.

598
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,568
Down, and one.

599
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:39,364
Breathe and stretch.

600
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,575
Stretch, and one.

601
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,204
Lift and stretch.

602
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,249
Back, and one.

603
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:54,087
Lift, and lengthen that foot.

604
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,588
And it's one.

605
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,759
Extend.

606
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,304
Reach out.

607
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,767
Lift and breathe.

608
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,604
And one.

609
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,608
Lift out,

610
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,861
and close.

611
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,612
And one.

612
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,781
Lift.

613
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,028
When's the audition, then?

614
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,738
Tomorrow morning.

615
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,533
I'll miss you if you go away.

616
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:09,162
Who do you think's better?
Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers?

617
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,082
Billy, do you not fancy us, like?

618
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,464
Don't know. Never really thought about it.

619
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,889
If you want, I'll show you me fanny.

620
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,273
No. You're all right.

621
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:01,714
Get inside!

622
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,343
The union leader! Get him!

623
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,763
Get down!

624
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,703
Thanks, pet.

625
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,712
Wanker!

626
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,429
Keep away from there, son.

627
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,432
Shit.

628
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,306
Tony!

629
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,478
Tony, come back!

630
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:57,330
Go on. Get in there! Off you go, mate!

631
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:16,307
Miss, I've got a problem with the audition.

632
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,309
Hello?

633
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,521
Hello!

634
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,988
Right, this is for Court Four.

635
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:35,535
Tony Elliot, George Brunton,

636
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,662
- Gary Cummings.
- What's the time?

637
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:40,748
- Colin Woodward.
- 10:10.

638
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,376
Robert Taylor.

639
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,546
Oh, Billy!

640
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,375
Hello.

641
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,216
Can I help you?

642
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,136
- I was looking for...
- They're out.

643
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:36,762
Sorry.

644
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:47,064
- Billy.
- Please, Miss.

645
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,774
Don't.

646
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,735
What's going on, Billy?

647
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,196
Who the fuck are you?

648
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,575
I think we better go inside.

649
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,667
I know this might be difficult for you,

650
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:10,129
but today Billy missed
a very important audition.

651
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,798
Audition?

652
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:14,967
For the Royal Ballet School.

653
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,766
The Royal Ballet?

654
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,852
School. It's where they teach the ballet.

655
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,855
You've got to be joking, love.

656
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,150
No, I'm perfectly serious.

657
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,700
Have you any idea of
what we're going through?

658
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,246
I've been in a fucking cell all night,

659
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,414
and you come around here talking shite!

660
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,709
And, you! Fucking ballet!

661
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:52,088
What are you trying to do, make him
a fucking scab for the rest of his life?

662
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,508
Look at him! He's only 11, for fuck's sake!

663
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,385
You've gotta start training
from when you're young.

664
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,719
Shut it!

665
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:03,099
I'm not having any brother of mine running
around like a right twat for your gratification.

666
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:06,978
Excuse me. This is not
for my gratification.

667
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,605
And what good's it gonna do him?
You're not taking him away.

668
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,191
He's only a bairn!
What about giving him a childhood?

669
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,610
I don't want a childhood.
I want to be a ballet dancer.

670
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,946
And anyway, what do you know about it?

671
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,572
What qualifications have you got?

672
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,534
I haven't come here to defend meself.

673
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,287
Well, for all we know,
you could be some fucking nutter.

674
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,122
I should get the fucking Social on to you.

675
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,916
I think you should calm yourself down, son.

676
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:32,545
You say he can dance. Well, go on, then.

677
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,674
- Let's see this fucking dancing.
- No.

678
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,967
This is ridiculous.

679
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,721
If you're a fucking ballet dancer,
then let's be having you.

680
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,847
Don't you dare!

681
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,557
What sort of a teacher are you?

682
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,436
He's got the chance to dance.
Now, you're fucking telling him not to.

683
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,354
Dance, you little twat!

684
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,028
No? So piss off.

685
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,113
He's not doing any more fucking ballet,

686
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,991
and if you go anywhere near him again,
I'll smack you one, you middle-class cow!

687
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,077
You know nothing about me,
you sanctimonious little shit!

688
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,083
He won't grow up to race whippets, or grow
leeks, or piss his wages up the wall!

689
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,169
He's been with me...

690
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,393
Billy! Billy!

691
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,722
Billy! Billy, come on!

692
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,314
Hurry up.

693
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:29,406
Merry Christmas, everybody!

694
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,147
Do you think she'll mind?

695
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,527
Shut it, Billy. She's dead.

696
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,310
Well, Merry Christmas, everybody.

697
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,313
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

698
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,939
Merry Christmas.

699
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,855
Fucking great Christmas this has been.

700
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,649
Go on. Have some.

701
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,858
Where'd you get it?

702
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,152
- Me dad's got loads in the kitchen.
- Won't he notice?

703
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,571
He never knows how much is there.

704
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,240
Tastes like piss.

705
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,076
You get used to it.

706
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,661
Here.

707
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,749
Maybe you could run away or something.

708
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,959
You know, join a dancing troupe.

709
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,753
Don't be so stupid.

710
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,047
Well, maybe it's all for the best.

711
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,298
What do you mean?

712
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,717
You won't have to go away or nothing.

713
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,719
My hands are freezing.

714
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,180
Give us them here.

715
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,272
What are you doing?

716
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,150
Nothing. Just warming your hands up.

717
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,282
You're not a poof or aught?

718
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,369
What gave you that impression?

719
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,163
Aren't me hands cold?

720
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,374
I quite like it.

721
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,553
Just 'cause I like ballet

722
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,222
doesn't mean I'm a poof, you know?

723
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,144
You won't tell anyone, will you?

724
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,358
Come on.

725
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,082
It's fucking freezing in here.

726
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,543
Here.

727
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,588
- What's this?
- Just put it on.

728
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,006
A tutu.

729
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,848
George. George.
There's somebody in the club.

730
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,434
This kangaroo,
he's walking away over it, right?

731
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,312
And he's called Norman.

732
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,940
And then round the corner
came this wallaby.

733
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,995
Plié, first.

734
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:46,997
What's a plié?

735
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,624
It's French.

736
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,917
Why's it French?

737
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:53,545
I don't know. Second. Like a princess.

738
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,721
Second, and down.

739
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:07,351
And first. Carry on. Fifth.

740
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,105
Shoulders down, long neck.

741
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,482
How do I look?

742
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:14,650
Shut up, you poof.

743
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,776
Fuck off!

744
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,530
Second, and down.

745
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,991
And first.

746
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,787
Fifth. Second.

747
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:28,831
Down.

748
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,084
First. Fifth.

749
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,879
Jackie.

750
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:38,590
Jackie, man. Here.

751
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,387
Give us your hand.

752
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,270
Dance!

753
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,843
Dad!

754
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,055
Go home, Son.

755
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,080
Is this a friend of yours, then?

756
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,045
How much is it gonna cost?

757
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,464
And a happy Christmas to you, too.

758
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:29,594
Not as much as you might think.
Maybe two grand.

759
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,931
- But there's a good chance the council's...
- Two grand?

760
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,850
I was talking about the auditions.

761
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,519
Look, it's just a matter
of the trip to London.

762
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,646
I'll give you the money for the fare.

763
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:41,773
I didn't come here to be patronized.

764
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:46,236
Oh, no one's trying to patronize you.
You're being ridiculous.

765
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,155
- Am I?
- Yes!

766
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,704
Thanks for everything
you've done for Billy.

767
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,831
But he is my son, isn't he?

768
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,959
I'll handle this myself.

769
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,969
Hey, fellow. Name. You.

770
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,054
Paul.

771
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,138
Surname.

772
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:56,890
- Felton.
- Felton.

773
01:13:58,309 --> 01:13:59,643
Shorty. You.

774
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,563
- What? Thorpe.
- Thorpe.

775
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,734
- Smith.
- Smith.

776
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,152
- Glenton.
- Glenton.

777
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:10,862
- Kerner.
- Kerner.

778
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,824
Is that the lot, then?

779
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:17,702
Fucking hell.
I never thought I'd see you down here.

780
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,454
Things change.

781
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,833
Right, you, name.

782
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,169
Jackie Elliot.

783
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,214
Well, glad to see you've
come to your senses.

784
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,509
Who's a big man now?

785
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:50,110
Right. Okay, you lot. Over here.
All aboard the skylark. Look lively.

786
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,492
Can't smoke on here, mate.
These are private buses.

787
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,963
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab!

788
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,698
Keep back!

789
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:49,252
Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab! Scab...

790
01:15:58,095 --> 01:15:59,763
Fuck off!

791
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,727
Dad! Dad!

792
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,383
Give us a hand.

793
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,654
Dad!

794
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,365
What the fuck are you doing?

795
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,293
Dad, you can't go back! Not now!

796
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,254
Look at the state of us, man.
What we got to offer the poor sod?

797
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,880
You can't do this! Not now!

798
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,258
Not after all this time!
Not after everything we've been through!

799
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:22,262
It's for wee Billy!
He may be a fucking genius for all we know!

800
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,639
For fuck's sake, Dad!
You can't do this, man!

801
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,599
Dad! Dad!

802
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,059
Tony!

803
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:31,396
He's only 11, for fuck's sake. He's a kid.

804
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,690
He's just a fucking little kid.

805
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:35,942
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

806
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:38,945
Please. Please.

807
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,072
I'm sorry, Son.

808
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:45,327
We're finished, Son.

809
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,414
What choice have we got?

810
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,875
Let's give the boy a fucking chance!

811
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:56,004
Please. Please, don't do this to me.
Dad, we'll find him some money.

812
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,089
We'll find it for him.

813
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,259
What the fuck is he doing, Tony?

814
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,387
It's okay. He's gonna be okay.

815
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,639
Just get him out of here, Tony.

816
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:09,809
Away. Leave it. Go on. Leave it.

817
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,770
Let's go home, Dad.

818
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,692
Dad's right, you know.

819
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,323
Mom would've let you.

820
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,377
All them 50 pences.

821
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:39,089
Here. It was a toss-up between
a new punch bag or you.

822
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,132
It's not even enough
for the bed and breakfast, man.

823
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,259
Forget about it. You're dreaming.
Look at youse.

824
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:46,054
Fucking scrabbling round for 50 pences.

825
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,014
You've got to do better than that.

826
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:50,683
How! I'm gonna have a
raffle at the welfare.

827
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,269
And I'm gonna organize a concert.

828
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:54,896
Thanks, George.

829
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:03,822
Sheila's not got that kind of money.
She can't even keep the soup kitchen open.

830
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,490
George said we can
have another whip-round.

831
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:08,993
Billy, there's no money left.
Get that through your head, man!

832
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,997
The lads will always
dip into their buckets if we ask them.

833
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:18,586
George, you know there's nothing left.
Stop putting ideas in his head, man!

834
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,760
Come on, lads. Dig deep for the miners.

835
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:02,547
Is that absolutely necessary?
Walk normal, will you?

836
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,972
So what's it like, like?

837
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,768
What's what like?

838
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:18,480
London.

839
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,944
I don't know, son.
I never made it past Durham.

840
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,449
Have you never been, like?

841
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,159
Why would I want to go to London?

842
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,119
It's the capital city.

843
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,501
Well, there's no mines in London.

844
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:43,421
Christ. Is that all you think about?

845
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,369
Can I help you?

846
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,539
Billy Elliot.
We've come for an audition.

847
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:20,375
You mean William Elliot?

848
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:21,626
Yeah, William.

849
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,920
Yes. Can you go upstairs, please?

850
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,005
- This way?
- Yes.

851
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,298
Thanks.

852
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,789
- This your first time?
- Yeah.

853
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,542
I've been doing this for two years now.

854
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,295
Hello.

855
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,672
Nerve-racking, isn't it?

856
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:10,883
Where are you from?

857
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:13,678
Everington, County Durham.

858
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,557
Durham? Isn't there an amazing cathedral?

859
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,394
Don't know. Never been.

860
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,692
Up on the box, please.

861
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:31,696
All right, bend over. Right down.

862
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:35,617
And come up. And up.

863
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,035
Head down.

864
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:40,246
Tiny curvature here. Head down!

865
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,497
How tiny?

866
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:44,542
Might not be a problem. Come on.
Keep going.

867
01:22:45,753 --> 01:22:48,296
Right. All right. Jump up, William.

868
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,757
It's Billy. Billy Elliot.

869
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:58,222
Two, three, and four.

870
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,100
Dad.

871
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,395
Dad! Dad, for fuck's sake!

872
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,108
I changed me mind.

873
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:12,070
Get back in there! Don't be so stupid!

874
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,670
And you are?

875
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,631
Billy Elliot from Everington.

876
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,091
I beg your pardon?

877
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,801
Billy Elliot.

878
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:39,722
Yes, of course. Come to
the bar, please, Billy.

879
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:51,609
Left arm on the bar. Feet first.

880
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,445
Arms second.

881
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:59,909
Demi-plié, and hold.

882
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,399
Now, Billy,
we'd like to see you move to some music.

883
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,651
Do you have a piece prepared?

884
01:25:58,821 --> 01:25:59,987
Thank you.

885
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:15,169
You all right? What's the matter?

886
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,588
It was a waste of fucking time!

887
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,677
Don't be upset. It's
only a stupid audition.

888
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:25,513
- It's all right.
- Fuck off!

889
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,017
There's always next year.

890
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,270
Look, fuck off, will you!

891
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,815
You bent bastard!

892
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:43,030
What on earth is going on here?

893
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,581
How did it go?

894
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,253
Shit!

895
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:03,551
Mr Elliot, I'm afraid
that mutual respect and self-discipline

896
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:07,471
are absolute prerequisites
for any pupil in this school.

897
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:12,226
Such displays of violence cannot be
tolerated under any circumstances.

898
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:13,978
Do you understand?

899
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,398
I realize we shall have to
consider this very seriously,

900
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:21,319
and it will be bound to
affect our final decision.

901
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:28,159
Yes, well, just a few
questions, then. Billy,

902
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:33,831
can you tell us why you first became
interested in the ballet?

903
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,296
Don't know.

904
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:45,718
Just was.

905
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:50,056
Well, was there any particular
aspect of the ballet

906
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,309
which caught your imagination?

907
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,231
The dancing.

908
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,527
He dances all the time.
Every night after school.

909
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:08,783
Yes. Well, we have a very enthusiastic
letter from Mrs Wilkinson,

910
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:14,664
and she has told us of
your personal circumstances.

911
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:18,960
Mr Elliot, are you a fan of the ballet?

912
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,382
I wouldn't exactly say I was an expert.

913
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:31,555
You do realize that all pupils
must attain the highest standards,

914
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,726
not just in ballet,
but in their ordinary academic work.

915
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:40,481
No child can succeed
without the 100% support of the family.

916
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:45,528
You are completely behind Billy.

917
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:48,864
Are you not?

918
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:53,911
Yes. Yes, of course.

919
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,499
Do you want to ask us any questions?

920
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:11,554
No, not really. No.

921
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,266
Well, in that case,

922
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,519
we shall let you know in due course.

923
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,444
Just one last question.

924
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,279
Can I ask you, Billy,

925
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:32,658
what does it feel like when you're dancing?

926
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,709
Don't know.

927
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:47,798
Sort of feels good.

928
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:54,138
It's sort of stiff and that,
but once I get going,

929
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,557
then I forget everything.

930
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,226
And,

931
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:04,815
sort of disappear.

932
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,071
Sort of disappear.

933
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,908
Like I feel a change in me whole body.

934
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,912
Like there's fire in me body.

935
01:30:19,456 --> 01:30:22,374
I'm just there, flying.

936
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,378
Like a bird.

937
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,174
Like electricity.

938
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:37,848
Yeah.

939
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,852
Like electricity.

940
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:46,524
Have a safe journey home.

941
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,656
Mr Elliot,

942
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:56,617
good luck with the strike.

943
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,047
Toast!

944
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,718
I think you should get
yourself a trade, son.

945
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,140
Something useful.

946
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,564
I could have been a professional dancer.

947
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,820
What happened to the dinosaurs, Miss?

948
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,738
They were crushed as well,

949
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:40,578
and the pressure of all of this caused
the plants and trees to change into coal.

950
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:42,705
That's what must have happened to her.

951
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:45,583
Michael Caffrey,
if you have got something to say,

952
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,376
you can say it to the class.

953
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,544
Sorry, Miss.

954
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:53,716
So, gradually,
over hundreds of thousands of years...

955
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:03,601
Post!

956
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:09,023
This is it.

957
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,320
- Have you heard anything yet?
- Not yet.

958
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:17,781
You'll have no problem, man.
Fingers crossed.

959
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,709
I got in.

960
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:37,648
He did it! He fucking did it!

961
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,651
Jackie, have you not heard, man?

962
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:44,530
We're going back.

963
01:35:44,614 --> 01:35:47,699
Strike's over, Jackie.
The union caved in yesterday.

964
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,419
I think I'm scared, Dad.

965
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,547
That's okay, Son. We're all scared.

966
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,554
Well, if I don't like it,
can I still come back?

967
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,892
You kidding?

968
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:16,854
We've let out your room.

969
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,163
Whoo!

970
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:52,973
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

971
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:57,561
And one, two, three, four,

972
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:00,564
five, six, seven.

973
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:03,358
Keep going, girls!

974
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:06,945
Three, four, five...

975
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:17,748
Miss, I just came to tell you.

976
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:22,503
It's all right, Billy. I
heard it from Debbie.

977
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:26,673
Look, it was just...

978
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:29,927
Well, you know, after everything.

979
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,352
- I'll miss you, Miss.
- No, you won't.

980
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:40,646
I will. Honest.

981
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,025
This is when you go out and find life,

982
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,902
and all those other things.

983
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,324
The best of luck, Billy.

984
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:03,877
Right. Back to the bar, girls. And again.
Thank you.

985
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:08,340
One, two, three, four...

986
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,385
Debbie, eyes front. Seven and eight.

987
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:17,057
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

988
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:21,853
- Was she there?
- Yeah.

989
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:23,730
- You'll miss the bus.
- We're off.

990
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:25,566
I'll take it.

991
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:07,107
Give us the bag.

992
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:09,234
Okay, right, we don't have time for this.

993
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,029
I'll take it.

994
01:39:18,745 --> 01:39:20,495
Good-bye, Billy.

995
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,122
See you.

996
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:37,387
Oi! Dancing boy!

997
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:40,599
We'll miss the bus, Billy.

998
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:43,477
Will you stop being an old fucking woman?

999
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,702
See you, then.

1000
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,476
I'll miss you.

1001
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,937
What? Can't hear you.

1002
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:32,062
Dad. Come on, man. We're gonna be late.

1003
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:39,861
Dad!

1004
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:50,330
Come on!

1005
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:56,002
Show's just started.

1006
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:00,549
Excuse me.

1007
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:06,346
Can you tell Billy Elliot
that his family's here?

1008
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:12,102
- Sorry, mate.
- It's all right, Tony.

1009
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:17,899
It's me, Michael. Remember?

1010
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:27,158
It's Michael.

1011
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,289
What the bloody hell are you doing here?

1012
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:35,125
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1013
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:46,428
Stand by, please.

1014
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:15,832
Billy, your family are here.

1015
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:17,417
Thanks.
