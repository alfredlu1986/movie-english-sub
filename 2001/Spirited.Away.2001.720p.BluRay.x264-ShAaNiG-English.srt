1
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:18,179
<i>"I'll miss you, Chihiro.</i>
<i>Your best friend, Rumi."</i>

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,242
<i>Chihiro.</i>
<i>Chihiro, we're almost there.</i>

3
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:25,984
<i>This really is in</i>
<i>the middle of nowhere.</i>

4
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:28,788
<i>I'm gonna have to</i>
<i>go to the next town to shop.</i>

5
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,091
<i>We'll just have to learn to like it.</i>

6
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:37,132
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?

7
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:40,330
<i>It doesn't look so bad.</i>

8
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:51,713
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,154
Mom! My flowers are dying.

10
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:59,884
I told you not to
smother them like that.

11
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:04,019
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

12
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,793
I finally get a bouquet, and it's
a good-bye present. That's depressing.

13
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,233
Daddy bought you a rose for
your birthday. Don't you remember?

14
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:14,295
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

15
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,137
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.

16
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,838
<i>And quit whining.</i>
<i>It's fun to move to a new place.</i>

17
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,904
<i>It's an adventure.</i>

18
00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:00,113
Wait. Did I take the wrong turn?

19
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,510
This can't be right.

20
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:06,022
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

21
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,524
<i>It's that blue one on the end.</i>

22
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:12,359
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turnoff.

23
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,864
<i>This road should get us there.</i>

24
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,264
<i>Don't take a shortcut.</i>
<i>You always get us lost.</i>

25
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,304
<i>- Trust me. It's gonna work.</i>
<i>- What are those stones?</i>

26
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,306
- They look like little houses.
- They're shrines.

27
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:26,343
Some people think
little spirits live there.

28
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:35,275
- Dad, I think we're lost.
- We're fine. I've got four-wheel drive.

29
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,446
- Sit down, please, sweetie.

30
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:56,503
<i>- Honey! Honey!</i>

31
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:59,941
- Slow down! You're gonna kill us.

32
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:04,070
What's that?

33
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:21,660
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

34
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,362
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.

35
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,495
Chihiro.

36
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,506
Oh, for heaven's sake.

37
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,270
This building's not old. It's fake.

38
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,607
These stones are
just made of plaster.

39
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:45,989
- The wind's pulling us in.

40
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:49,993
- What is it? - Let's go in.
I want to see what's on the other side.

41
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,723
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.

42
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:55,493
Don't be such
a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.

43
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:59,502
- Let's just take a look.
- The movers will get to our house before we do.

44
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,301
It's all right. They've got the keys.
They can start without us.

45
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:06,935
- All right. Just a quick look.
- Forget it. I'm not going.

46
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,611
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

47
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,615
Come on, honey. It'll be fun.

48
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:15,117
I'm not going!

49
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:25,394
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

50
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:28,523
But, Mom!

51
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,296
- Wait for me!

52
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:39,808
Everybody, watch your step.

53
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,937
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

54
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,269
What is this place?

55
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:20,181
- Oh, do you hear that?

56
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,283
- It sounds like a train.
- We must be near a train station.

57
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,659
Come on. Let's go check it out.

58
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:12,425
- What are those weird buildings?
<i>- I knew it.</i>

59
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:16,234
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

60
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:19,902
<i>They built them</i>
<i>everywhere in the early '90s.</i>

61
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:23,879
<i>Then the economy went bad,</i>
<i>and they all went bankrupt.</i>

62
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,848
This must be one of them.

63
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,909
Where are you going?
You said just a quick look.

64
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:31,614
Now let's go back.

65
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,953
Hey!

66
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,437
Did you hear that building?
It was moaning.

67
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:49,439
It's just the wind.

68
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,407
Oh, what a beautiful place.

69
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,410
We should have brought our lunch.
We could have had a picnic.

70
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,443
Look. They were planning
to put a river here.

71
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:03,385
Hmm?

72
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:07,322
- Hey, you smell that?

73
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:10,258
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

74
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:13,195
Maybe this theme park's
still in business. Let's go.

75
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,198
Chihiro, hurry it up.

76
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,257
Wait a minute.

77
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:35,744
Hmm.

78
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,914
Over there.

79
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,225
This way.

80
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:59,472
How strange.
They're all restaurants.

81
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,807
Where is everybody?

82
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,949
Ah, there it is.

83
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,990
Hey, I found it!

84
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,060
Hey, you gotta see this. In here.

85
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,463
Ahh, look at this.

86
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,839
Hello in there!
Does anybody work here?

87
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,674
- Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.
- Mm-mmm.

88
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,737
Anybody?

89
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,788
Don't worry, honey. We can pay the bill
when they get back.

90
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:47,255
Good plan. Hey, that looks great.

91
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:51,260
I wonder what this is called.

92
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:54,491
Oh, it's delicious. Chihiro,
you have to taste this.

93
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:59,127
I don't want any. We're gonna get
in trouble. Let's just get out of here.

94
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:02,172
Don't worry.
You've got Daddy here.

95
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:04,901
He's got credit cards and cash.

96
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,966
Mmm.

97
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:13,180
- Chihiro, you have to try this.
It's so tender. - Mm-mmm.

98
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,241
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

99
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:20,080
<i>- Mmm.</i>

100
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,530
Come on, you guys. You can't.

101
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,501
That's weird.

102
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:52,113
<i>It's a bathhouse.</i>

103
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,995
There's the train.

104
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,544
- You shouldn't be here.
Get out of here now!

105
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,548
- What?
- It's almost night.

106
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:27,550
Leave, before it gets dark.

107
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,414
They're lighting the lamps.
Get out of here.

108
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:36,050
You've gotta get across the river. Go!
I'll distract them.

109
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,573
What's up with him?

110
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,083
Mom! Dad!

111
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,645
Come on! Quit eating.
Let's get out of here!

112
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,483
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

113
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,027
Mommy!

114
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,382
Water?

115
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,858
What?

116
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:27,130
I'm dreaming!
I'm dreaming!

117
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,407
Come on. Wake up! Wake up!

118
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:35,239
Wake up.

119
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,343
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream. Go away.

120
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,412
Away. Disappear.

121
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:58,257
I'm see-through!

122
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:01,304
It's just a bad dream.

123
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:36,405
- Oh!

124
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:44,303
<i>You're thriving. Ah, yes.</i>

125
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:47,578
- Looking forward to a relaxing time.
- Quite a long journey.

126
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:51,610
<i>- I hope they have...</i>

127
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,925
Don't be afraid.
I just want to help you.

128
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,053
No! No! No!

129
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:01,222
Open your mouth and eat this.

130
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,961
You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.

131
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,730
No!

132
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,469
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.

133
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:15,979
- Chew it and swallow.

134
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:27,287
There you go. You're all better.

135
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:29,348
See for yourself.

136
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,530
- I'm okay.
- You see?

137
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,299
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

138
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,670
They... didn't really
turn into pigs, did they?

139
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:47,403
You can't see them now,
but you will.

140
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,646
- Don't move.

141
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,098
That bird's looking for you.
You've gotta get out of here.

142
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:16,799
My legs! I can't stand up.

143
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:18,808
Help! What do I do?

144
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:21,811
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

145
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:28,784
In the name of the wind
and water within thee, unbind her.

146
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:31,548
- Get up.

147
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,781
<i>- Welcome. Welcome.</i>

148
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:08,586
<i>Always nice to see you.</i>
<i>Welcome back.</i>

149
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,560
<i>- Welcome. Welcome.</i>

150
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:15,689
<i>You have to hold your breath</i>
<i>while we cross the bridge.</i>

151
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:21,102
Even the tiniest breath will break the
spell, and then everyone will see you.

152
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,867
<i>- Wonderful to see you.</i>

153
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:26,000
<i>- Nice to see you.</i>
<i>- Welcome back.</i>

154
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:28,101
I'm scared.

155
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:30,112
Now just stay calm.

156
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,081
Welcome. Welcome.
Always nice to see you.

157
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,618
Welcome back.
Welcome. Welcome.

158
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:38,086
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ahh, welcome.

159
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,089
Welcome back, Master Haku.

160
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:43,024
- Take a deep breath.

161
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,152
Hold it.

162
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:03,174
Welcome. Welcome.

163
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,045
Welcome back.
Good to see you.

164
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,107
- Hang on. Almost there.

165
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,619
Master Haku!

166
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,019
Where have you been?

167
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,218
Wha... A human?

168
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,352
Let's go!

169
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:31,335
Huh? Huh? Huh?

170
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:39,541
Master Haku!
Master Haku!

171
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,414
<i>Hurry. Boy, boy, boy,</i>
<i>it stinks up the place.</i>

172
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:45,284
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry. I took a breath.

173
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,380
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

174
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:49,891
Listen carefully to
what I tell you to do.

175
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,894
You can't stay here.
They'll find you...

176
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,953
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

177
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,022
I'll create a diversion
while you escape.

178
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,329
No! Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be alone.

179
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,860
You don't have any choice if you want
to help your parents.

180
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,929
This is what you have to do.

181
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:08,205
They did turn into pigs.
I wasn't dreaming.

182
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:10,269
Don't worry.

183
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:14,215
<i>Now, when things quiet down,</i>
<i>go out through the back gate.</i>

184
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:17,583
<i>Go all the way down the stairs</i>
<i>until you reach the boiler room...</i>

185
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,918
<i>where they stoke the fires.</i>

186
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,050
<i>There you'll find Kamajii,</i>
<i>the boiler man.</i>

187
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,390
Kamajii?

188
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:28,124
Tell him you want to work here.

189
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:30,689
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

190
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,669
If you don't get a job,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

191
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,672
Yubaba. Huh?

192
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,140
You'll see. She's the witch who
rules the bathhouse.

193
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:42,406
Kamajii will try to turn you away
or trick you into leaving...

194
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:44,413
but just keep asking for work.

195
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:47,848
It'll be hard work,
but you'll be able to stay here.

196
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,409
- Then, even Yubaba can't harm you.
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:53,422
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

198
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,187
I have to go. Don't forget, Chihiro,
I'm your friend.

199
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,160
How did you know
my name's Chihiro?

200
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,663
I've known you
since you were very small.

201
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:04,667
Good luck, and whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

202
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,669
<i>- Master Haku.</i>

203
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,728
Calm down. I'm coming.

204
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,901
<i>Master Haku,</i>
<i>Yubaba wants to see you.</i>

205
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:17,003
I know. It's about
my mission, right?

206
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:30,588
There's a human someplace.
We must find him.

207
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,322
Let's go this way.

208
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:36,332
Wait for me.
Wait for me. Wait.

209
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,425
Come on. Everything's fine.

210
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:28,058
Uh, hello. Excuse me.

211
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:37,767
Uh, hello?

212
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,577
Uh, hello. Are you Kamajii?

213
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:48,140
Eh?

214
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:50,982
Huh?

215
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:55,889
Haku told me to come here
and ask you for work.

216
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,450
- Could you give me a job?

217
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:05,326
Four bath tokens at once.

218
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:07,768
- Come on. Get to work, you little runts.

219
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:10,533
<i>Yeah, I'm Kamajii...</i>

220
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:14,202
slave to the boiler
that heats the baths.

221
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:17,041
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

222
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:19,707
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

223
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:21,717
I don't need any help.

224
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:25,414
The place is full of soot.
I just cast a spell on them...

225
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:28,184
<i>and I've got all</i>
<i>the workers I need.</i>

226
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:44,001
- Oh. Sorry.

227
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:49,310
Wait. Just a second.

228
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,350
- Out of the way.

229
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:58,279
What should I do with this?

230
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:06,387
Should I leave it here?

231
00:27:06,456 --> 00:27:08,924
Finish what you started, human.

232
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,805
- Hmm?

233
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:12,749
Hey, you runts. You wanna turn
back into soot?

234
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:16,349
And you, back off. You can't just take
someone else's job.

235
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:19,827
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
They turn back into soot.

236
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:24,230
There's no work for you here, got it?
Try somewhere else.

237
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:36,311
You soot balls got a problem?
Get back to work!

238
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,110
Chow time. What's going on?

239
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:42,447
Are you guys fighting again?

240
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:45,248
- Where's your other bowl?

241
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:47,255
- Oh. Ahh.
- From yesterday?

242
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:50,053
I keep telling you
to leave it out, Kamajii.

243
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:52,151
Meal time! Take a break.

244
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:13,310
A human! You're in trouble.
You're the one everyone's looking for.

245
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:16,011
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

246
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,521
She said she wants to work here...

247
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:21,716
but I've got all the help I need.

248
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:25,056
Will you take her to see Yubaba?
She's a tough little girl.

249
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:27,062
I think she can handle it.

250
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,758
No way.
I'm not gonna risk my life.

251
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:33,996
What if I give you
this roasted newt? Hmm?

252
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,334
It's a good one.

253
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:40,433
If you want a job, you'll have to
make a deal with Yubaba.

254
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,910
She's the head honcho here.

255
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:46,915
Give me that! Come on, little girl.
You better follow me.

256
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,949
- Can't you even manage a "Yes, ma'am" 
or a "Thank you"? - Yes, ma'am.

257
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:58,960
What a dope. Hurry up.

258
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:01,292
- Yes, ma'am.

259
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,162
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>your shoes or your socks.</i>

260
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,167
<i>- Just leave 'em.</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

261
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:16,604
Thank the boiler man, you idiot.
You know, he's really sticking his neck out for you.

262
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,410
Thank you, Mr. Boiler Man.

263
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:23,247
Good luck.

264
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:36,726
We have to go all the way to the
top floor. That's where Yubaba lives.

265
00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:51,876
<i>Get over here.</i>

266
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:59,154
- You wanna lose your nose?

267
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:12,324
<i>More appetizers.</i>

268
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:14,336
<i>Not spicy enough.</i>

269
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:25,573
- We're halfway there. Just stay close.
- Okay.

270
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:31,584
<i>Here we go.</i>

271
00:31:33,856 --> 00:31:36,324
The radish spirit.

272
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:43,989
Sorry, sir. This elevator
doesn't go any higher.

273
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,468
You'll have to take
another one. Thank you.

274
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:12,194
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

275
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:29,776
- Step out to the right,
please, gentlemen.

276
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,781
I don't think they're big enough.

277
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:36,785
Your rooms are right this way.

278
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:41,017
- Hmm. Rin?
- What?

279
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:45,387
What's that smell?

280
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:48,988
- It's human. You smell just like a human.
- Oh, really?

281
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:53,229
<i>Where's it coming from, Rin?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

282
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:56,703
You're hiding something, aren't you?

283
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:59,741
- Show it to me.
- Is this what you smell?

284
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,505
Roasted... newt!

285
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:05,945
No way, frog.
I'm saving every last bite for myself.

286
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:09,007
Please, just a little bit.
Just give me a leg.

287
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:13,181
- If you wanna go up,
pull the lever on your right.

288
00:33:13,256 --> 00:33:18,091
<i>Gimme, gimme, gimme.</i>
<i>How could you be so cruel?</i>

289
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:21,688
<i>- Can't you share?</i>

290
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:24,699
<i>Let me suck on the tail. Please!</i>

291
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:28,328
- Let me...
- Mmm.

292
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,519
- Aren't you even going to knock?

293
00:35:00,596 --> 00:35:04,362
You're the most pathetic little girl
I've ever seen.

294
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,569
Well, come in.

295
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:23,050
- I said, come in.

296
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,841
Quiet down.
You're making a racket.

297
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could give me a job?

298
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,806
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

299
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:29,544
You're just a stinking,
useless weakling.

300
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:34,885
And this is certainly
no place for humans.

301
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:38,154
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

302
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,924
It's where they come
to replenish themselves.

303
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:45,398
<i>And you humans</i>
<i>always make a mess of things.</i>

304
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:50,405
<i>Like your parents, who gobbled up</i>
<i>the food of the spirits like pigs.</i>

305
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:54,773
They got what they deserved,
and you should be punished too.

306
00:36:54,844 --> 00:37:00,749
Hmm.

307
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,807
You could be a piglet.

308
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:07,185
Or, maybe you'd prefer
a lump of coal?

309
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:19,701
I can see you shaking. Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

310
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,728
But I'm sure
you didn't do it on your own.

311
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:26,604
Let's thank whoever helped you.

312
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:30,839
Just who was it, dear?
Why don't you tell me.

313
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:35,373
- Please! Can't you give me a job?

314
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:38,579
- Don't start that again.
- Please, I just want to work.

315
00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:42,852
Don't say that!

316
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,525
Why in world do you think
I should give you a job?

317
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,967
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled crybaby...

318
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,597
and you have no manners.

319
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:00,904
This is a high-class place
I'm running here.

320
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:06,915
So there's no job for you. Now get out.
I've got all the lazy bums I need.

321
00:38:06,982 --> 00:38:12,750
- Or maybe I'll give you the most
difficult job I've got...

322
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,256
and work you until you breathe...

323
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:19,852
your very last breath.

324
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:35,072
Oh, dear,
you woke up the baby.

325
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:38,875
Mommy's here.
Be a good boy now.

326
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,610
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.

327
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:43,652
I want you to give me a job, please!

328
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,313
Quiet down! You're scaring the baby.

329
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:50,085
- Ooh! Hi, sweetie. Don't be angry.

330
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,619
- That's a good boy.

331
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:57,029
I'm not leaving
till you give me a job.

332
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,533
- Okay. Okay. Just be quiet.

333
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:04,471
Here comes Mommy.
I'm coming to get you.

334
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,962
<i>That's your contract.</i>

335
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:32,626
Sign your name away,
and I'll put you to work.

336
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:34,726
If I hear one little
complaint out of you...

337
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:38,000
you'll be joining
your parents in the pigpen.

338
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:40,473
So I...
Do I sign my name here?

339
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:43,944
<i>Just sign it.</i>
<i>Do you want the job or not?</i>

340
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:51,279
- I can't believe I took that oath.

341
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:54,345
Give a job to anyone who asks.

342
00:39:55,958 --> 00:40:00,486
Ridiculous. I hate being
so nice all the time. Ha!

343
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,123
<i>Are you done yet?</i>

344
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:10,697
- So, your name's Chihiro.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

345
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:13,571
What a pretty name.

346
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,881
And it belongs to me now.

347
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:28,981
<i>From now on, your name is Sen.</i>
<i>You got that?</i>

348
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:31,856
<i>- Answer me, Sen!</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

349
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:36,694
<i>You called for me?</i>

350
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:40,166
<i>This girl signed a contract.</i>
<i>Set her up with a job.</i>

351
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:43,068
Right. What's your name?

352
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:46,801
What? Chih... Oh. It's Sen.

353
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,275
Okay, Sen. Follow me.

354
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:59,113
Haku, uh...

355
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:03,386
Don't talk to me,
and address me as Master Haku.

356
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:24,302
- I don't care if Yubaba gets angry with us.
- We're not taking humans.

357
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,780
- She's already under contract.
- What?

358
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:31,047
- I promise to work very hard.
- We are not gonna take her in our department.

359
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,145
- She'll stink up the whole place.
- We don't want her.

360
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:36,419
Three days of eating our food,
and her smell will go away.

361
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:41,828
If she doesn't work hard, roast her,
boil her, do whatever you want.

362
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:44,422
Now get back to work.
Where is Rin?

363
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,934
What? Don't you dump her on me.

364
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:49,835
- You said you wanted an assistant.
- That's perfect.

365
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:52,100
- Give the girl to Rin.
<i>- Oh, great.</i>

366
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:55,007
- Sen, get going.
- Right.

367
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:58,513
Why are you picking on me?
You owe me one, Haku. You hear me?

368
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,346
- Have a nice day.
- Hmph.

369
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,682
Come on.

370
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,686
I can't believe you pulled it off.

371
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:17,459
- Huh?
<i>- You're such a dope. I was really worried.</i>

372
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:22,266
Now, keep on your toes,
and if you need anything, ask me. Okay?

373
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:24,965
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

374
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,975
I don't feel so good.

375
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:35,173
So, this is our room.

376
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,844
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

377
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,148
Here's your apron. You have to
wash it yourself. Your pants.

378
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:48,026
You're so puny.

379
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:50,190
Way too big.

380
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:53,860
- Rin, you know Haku?
<i>- What about him?</i>

381
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:56,200
There aren't two of him
here, are there?

382
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:01,072
Two Hakus?
I can barely stand one. Too big.

383
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:04,374
He's Yubaba's henchman.
Don't trust anything he says.

384
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:10,412
<i>- Let's see.</i>

385
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:15,890
Ah, here we go.
Wh-What's wrong with you?

386
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,086
Are you feeling okay?

387
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,186
Quiet down. What's your problem?

388
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:24,494
It's the new girl.
She doesn't feel so good.

389
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:59,686
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your parents.

390
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:49,433
- My shoes are gone.

391
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:54,238
- Huh?

392
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:01,846
Thank you.

393
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,885
- Follow me.

394
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,265
We don't have much time. If you're found here,
you'll be turned into a pig yourself.

395
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:31,804
- You must never come here
without me. Understand?

396
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,280
I understand.

397
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:58,998
Mom, Dad, are you all right?
It's me, Sen. Hey, wake up!

398
00:47:59,074 --> 00:48:01,474
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

399
00:48:05,213 --> 00:48:07,477
What's wrong with them?
Are they sick?

400
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:10,040
No. They ate too much.
They're sleeping it off.

401
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:12,518
<i>They don't remember</i>
<i>being human.</i>

402
00:48:12,587 --> 00:48:15,021
<i>So look hard. It's up to you</i>
<i>to remember which ones they are.</i>

403
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:21,385
Don't you worry, I promise
I'll get you out of here.

404
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:25,263
So just don't get any fatter
or they'll eat you!

405
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:35,439
Here are your clothes. Hide them.

406
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:42,375
- I thought they'd been thrown away.
- You'll need them to get home.

407
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:50,390
My good-bye card's still here.

408
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:57,421
Chihiro. Chihiro.
That's my name, isn't it?

409
00:48:57,499 --> 00:48:59,899
That's how Yubaba controls you...
by stealing your name.

410
00:48:59,968 --> 00:49:02,198
So hold on to that card.
Keep it hidden.

411
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,171
While you're here,
you must call yourself Sen.

412
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,232
I can't believe I forgot my name.
She almost took it from me.

413
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:13,111
If you completely forget it,
you'll never find your way home.

414
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:15,706
I've tried everything
to remember mine.

415
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,718
You can't remember your name?

416
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:21,187
No. But for some reason,
I remember yours.

417
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,692
Here you go. Eat this.
You must be hungry.

418
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:30,754
- No.
- I put a spell on it so it'll give you back your strength.

419
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:33,392
Just eat it.

420
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,270
Have some more. You'll be all right.

421
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,576
I've got to go now.
I'll be back to help you soon.

422
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:30,250
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Thank you, Haku. You're a good friend.

423
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:46,463
<i>Haku.</i>

424
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:52,570
<i>He's a dragon?</i>

425
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,204
Huh?

426
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:09,080
- Where were you, Sen? I was really worried.
- I'm sorry.

427
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:20,231
- Out of my way.

428
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,746
<i>- Gee, Sen...</i>

429
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:35,806
haven't you ever worked
a day in your life?

430
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:38,375
- Rin and Sen, you get the big tub today.
- What?

431
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:42,651
- Hey, that's frog work.
- Orders from the top. So quit your complaining.

432
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,905
Hello. Aren't you
getting wet out there?

433
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:13,010
<i>- Sen, hurry up.</i>
- Coming.

434
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:15,682
I'll leave the door open for you.

435
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:44,810
- Heard you got the big tub, Rin.
<i>- Leave me alone.</i>

436
00:53:48,523 --> 00:53:51,356
Those jerks. They haven't cleaned
this tub in months.

437
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:07,202
<i>We only use this tub</i>
<i>for our really filthy guests.</i>

438
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:11,211
Disgusting. This sludge is so caked on,
it'll take days to scrub off.

439
00:54:11,279 --> 00:54:13,975
Rin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

440
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:17,449
Wait! Give us a minute.
This is clearly harassment.

441
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,547
We'll have to soak it off. Get an herbal
soak token from the foreman.

442
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:25,320
A what?

443
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:29,420
- An herbal soak token.
- All right.

444
00:54:29,497 --> 00:54:31,522
Hey, Rin, what's a foreman?

445
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:38,061
Hmm. Something's coming.
I wonder what?

446
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:52,080
What useless scum
is sleeking around in the rain?

447
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:20,147
I can't waste a token on you.
Relax. Good morning.

448
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:22,479
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

449
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,179
- For the radish spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

450
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:29,223
Why are you still standing here?
Scrub it yourself.

451
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:33,090
I'm not giving you a token.
Relax. Good morning.

452
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:37,689
- I said scrub it yourself.
- But I was told it has to have an herbal soak.

453
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:43,704
Well, that's too bad. Mugwort bath?
Relax and enjoy it.

454
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:52,575
- Hmm?

455
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:56,105
Foreman speaking. Oh, yes. What?

456
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,984
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Get back here!</i>

457
00:56:00,054 --> 00:56:02,249
- Hey! Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

458
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:05,383
- Nothing. Everything's fine.
- We have an intruder.

459
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,090
- Is it a human?
- I'm not quite sure. Figure it out and report back.

460
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:12,724
Wow, Sen. You got a really good one.

461
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,531
Clip this on, then let go.

462
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:19,767
It goes straight to Kamajii,
then he sends us our water.

463
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:27,538
You pull on this to start
the water flowing. Give it a try.

464
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:40,450
- Uh, you're such a klutz.
- Yuck! What's in this water?

465
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:43,361
Dried worm salt.
It's supposed to be good for you.

466
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:47,891
And with water this murky,
you can't see all the sludge in the tub.

467
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:51,735
Yank it again when the bath
is full, it'll stop.

468
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:55,401
You can let go of the rope now.
I'll get us some breakfast.

469
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:57,467
Okay.

470
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:20,593
Ow!

471
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:28,236
Uh, sir.
The bath's not ready yet.

472
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:36,514
- There's so many.

473
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:42,783
- What? They're all for me?
- Uh... Uh...

474
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:45,382
Thanks, but I don't need any more.

475
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:49,928
- Uh...
- No. I only need one.

476
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:06,971
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

477
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:11,417
- And apparently, it's an extra smelly one.
- He's headed for the bridge.

478
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:17,914
We're closed.
Go away. We're not open.

479
00:58:17,992 --> 00:58:20,586
- Go! Please, go. Leave us.
<i>- There's no one here.</i>

480
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:27,696
Hmm. Something's fishy.
That doesn't seem like a stink spirit to me.

481
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:30,169
But we have no choice.
Go greet him.

482
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:34,675
<i>Just give him a bath and get him</i>
<i>out of here as fast as you can.</i>

483
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:38,678
Everybody go back to your rooms.
Back to your rooms.

484
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:42,739
<i>- Don't worry about a thing. Everybody just be calm.</i>
- Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.

485
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:46,014
- Yes, sir.
- Sen, don't mess this up.

486
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:49,420
Take this guest to the big tub
and take care of him.

487
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,425
- But-But, I...
- No buts, or I'll turn you into coal.

488
00:58:52,493 --> 00:58:55,553
- You hear me?
- It's here.

489
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:08,036
Hands down. You'll insult our guest.

490
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:20,277
Look about you, customer.
Welcome to our baths.

491
00:59:22,323 --> 00:59:25,121
Oh, it's money.

492
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:29,186
- Sen, take the nice customer's money.
- Yes, ma'am.

493
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:42,201
<i>Don't make him wait.</i>
<i>Get him to the bath.</i>

494
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:44,744
This way.

495
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:03,556
- Get out of my way!
- Sen!

496
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:12,639
Our food!

497
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:14,834
Open your windows, all of them!

498
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:16,809
<i>Quickly!</i>

499
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:00,419
What? Just a minute, sir.

500
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:07,622
Disgusting?

501
01:01:07,695 --> 01:01:10,823
- I don't think it's very funny.
- Let's see what she'll do next.

502
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,771
Look. She wants to refill the tub.

503
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,831
Oh, dear! She's gonna waste
all our good water!

504
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:25,737
Ow!

505
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:35,614
Hmm. Who gave her
all the bath tokens?

506
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,624
Don't look at me. I didn't do it.

507
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:22,592
Oh, no! That's our best
herbal formula!

508
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:50,588
Sen! Sen, where are you?

509
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:53,065
Over here!

510
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:56,103
Don't worry. St-Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to help you.

511
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,695
You're gonna be fine.
I won't let him hurt you.

512
01:02:58,773 --> 01:03:02,539
I think he needs help. It feels like
there's a thorn in his side.

513
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,238
<i>- A thorn?</i>
- It won't come out!

514
01:03:05,313 --> 01:03:09,215
What's that?
He has a thorn? Hmm.

515
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:12,150
- Get the staff down there. Step on it!
- Huh?

516
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:15,245
Right, right, right!
Get downstairs! Help her! You!

517
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:17,291
<i>- All of you!</i>
- Listen to me.

518
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,758
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands...

519
01:03:22,196 --> 01:03:24,391
- Grab onto this rope.
- Wait!

520
01:03:33,174 --> 01:03:36,109
- Mmm. Hold on tight.
- Got it.

521
01:03:36,177 --> 01:03:38,077
- Hurry up, now.
- Get in there!

522
01:03:38,145 --> 01:03:40,079
Everyone get in there
and help them.

523
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:42,047
We've got it tied on!

524
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,952
Everyone, ready on my command.

525
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:49,581
And... heave!

526
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:52,091
And... heave!

527
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,593
- Heave!
- And...

528
01:03:54,662 --> 01:03:57,096
<i>- heave!</i>
- Heave!

529
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:59,598
And heave!

530
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:03,603
<i>And heave!</i>

531
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:05,696
A bicycle?

532
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:07,707
Thought so.

533
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:09,709
Get ready, now!

534
01:04:09,777 --> 01:04:12,803
<i>- Heave!</i>
- Heave!

535
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,905
<i>Heave!</i>

536
01:04:43,944 --> 01:04:46,572
Sen! Sen, where are you?

537
01:04:56,924 --> 01:04:59,449
Well done.

538
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:06,756
Huh?

539
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:20,812
Ahh!

540
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:31,583
- Gold!
- Gold!

541
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:33,889
Hey, wait!
That's company property!

542
01:05:33,961 --> 01:05:35,895
<i>- Stop!</i>
- Back off!

543
01:05:35,963 --> 01:05:38,659
- Our guest is still here, you idiots!

544
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:46,267
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Step aside.

545
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,968
- Yes, ma'am.
- Open the main gates! Make way!

546
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:20,701
Sen, you did great!
We made so much money!

547
01:06:20,774 --> 01:06:24,972
That spirit is rich and powerful.
Everyone, learn from Sen.

548
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:28,014
<i>- Sake's on the house tonight.</i>

549
01:06:28,082 --> 01:06:31,483
<i>- But first, hand over</i>
<i>all the gold you picked up.</i>

550
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:34,953
- That's not fair!
- How stingy! That's no fair!

551
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:45,460
Here.

552
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:49,025
- I swiped a dumpling for you.
- Thank you.

553
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,594
What a day. Mmm.

554
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:56,438
- Rin, have you seen Haku?
- Not Haku again.

555
01:06:57,778 --> 01:06:59,746
He just disappears sometimes.

556
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:03,715
Rumor has it he runs around
doing Yubaba's dirty work.

557
01:07:03,784 --> 01:07:06,651
- Does he really?
<i>- Lights out, Rin.</i>

558
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,620
Fine.

559
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,474
There's so much water.
It looks like a sea.

560
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:38,575
<i>What'd you expect</i>
<i>after all that rain?</i>

561
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:44,988
I've gotta get out of this place.
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

562
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:58,094
Mmm.

563
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:09,782
- What's wrong?

564
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,003
Ah!

565
01:08:34,108 --> 01:08:36,133
Hmm.
Uh-uh.

566
01:08:37,878 --> 01:08:40,210
Huh?
Ahh!

567
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:42,579
It's gold! Huh?

568
01:08:44,318 --> 01:08:46,616
What do you think you're doing?
You're not allowed in there.

569
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:49,053
The bath's closed.
Get out, you! Get out of there!

570
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:56,861
Ooh! Oh! More gold!

571
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:58,830
Are you... Are you...
Are you giving them to me?

572
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:06,531
Wait. You can make gold?

573
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:11,067
Ahh.

574
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:13,079
Uh, gimme!

575
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:17,148
Ahh.

576
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:22,955
What's going on in there?

577
01:09:24,124 --> 01:09:26,251
It's way past bedtime. Come on!

578
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:29,262
-Wh...

579
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:33,198
Hey, boss, up here.
I'm hungry. Starving!

580
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:35,497
<i>- And I want you to serve me.</i>
- I know that voice.

581
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:37,469
<i>Here, I'll pay you up front.</i>

582
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:40,405
And... I wanna take a bath too.

583
01:09:40,474 --> 01:09:42,601
Why don't you wake everyone up?

584
01:09:48,248 --> 01:09:50,944
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the river spirit!

585
01:09:51,018 --> 01:09:53,714
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

586
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:01,119
Which ones are you?

587
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,288
Mom, Dad!

588
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:14,432
Bad dream.

589
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,442
Rin?

590
01:10:21,348 --> 01:10:23,282
Where is everybody?

591
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,820
Wow. It really is a sea.

592
01:10:33,026 --> 01:10:35,517
<i>There's Mom and Dad's pigpen.</i>

593
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:40,091
I sure hope they're doing
all right over there.

594
01:10:43,937 --> 01:10:46,497
Kamajii lit the boiler already?

595
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:49,371
How long was I asleep?

596
01:10:49,443 --> 01:10:51,843
- Hurry up!

597
01:10:51,912 --> 01:10:54,847
Come on, he's starving!
Can't you cook any faster?

598
01:10:54,915 --> 01:10:58,942
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers
if you have to. Hurry up! He's starving!

599
01:11:00,954 --> 01:11:03,388
<i>- Hey, Sen.</i>
- Oh, Rin.

600
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:06,051
I was just coming
to wake you up. Look.

601
01:11:06,126 --> 01:11:09,527
It's real gold.
There's a new guest here who's loaded.

602
01:11:09,596 --> 01:11:12,030
He's giving gold away
by the handfuls!

603
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:26,104
Just keep the food coming.
I wanna eat everything!

604
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:31,417
Hmm. Who is the guest?

605
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:35,421
Oh, who cares? Come on,
before Yubaba wakes up.

606
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:37,423
I'm going to go look for Haku.

607
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:40,517
Oh! Would you quit
worrying about Haku?

608
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:42,858
- Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.
- Come on, Rin!

609
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,091
- Let's go get some more!
- You bet!

610
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:47,065
<i>Hey, wait for me!</i>

611
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:07,876
<i>Where is Haku?</i>

612
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,649
He better get here before I forget
what my parents look like.

613
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:16,423
I sure hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

614
01:12:29,309 --> 01:12:31,675
Hmm?

615
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:36,915
Haku?

616
01:12:44,591 --> 01:12:47,355
It's Haku! He's back!

617
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:53,432
Are birds chasing him?

618
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:07,005
Haku! Fight 'em! Come on!

619
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,776
He's hurt!

620
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,842
<i>Haku, this way!</i>

621
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,547
Aah!

622
01:13:27,801 --> 01:13:30,201
Huh? It's just paper.

623
01:13:58,665 --> 01:14:00,997
Haku, you're bleeding.

624
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:11,610
Hold still. Those paper things are gone now.
You're going to be all right.

625
01:14:24,558 --> 01:14:29,518
He went in that top window.
I've got to get there before he bleeds to death!

635
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:14,399
- Going upstairs.
- No, you're not.

636

Huh? Aah! Blood!

Thank you for helping me earlier.

- Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...
- Hey!

640
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:52,071
I don't want any, but thanks.

641
01:15:54,781 --> 01:15:57,716
I'm sorry,
but I'm in a really big hurry.

642
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:11,927
- Hey, there! Hey! Get back! Get back now!
- Ow!

643
01:16:11,998 --> 01:16:14,796
Everybody, out!

644
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:16,802
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.

645
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:20,135
You'll have to excuse the little girl.
She's just a human.

646
01:16:23,243 --> 01:16:25,404
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- What?

647
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:27,538
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

648
01:17:21,234 --> 01:17:23,134
Aah!

649
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:55,934
Huh?

650
01:18:01,074 --> 01:18:02,974
It's Yubaba!

651
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:17,476
<i>We're in a big mess.</i>

652
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:20,018
<i>I found out who</i>
<i>our rich customer is.</i>

653
01:19:20,086 --> 01:19:22,953
<i>He's a No-Face!</i>
<i>It's all your fault. You're so greedy.</i>

654
01:19:23,023 --> 01:19:27,153
<i>You attract terrible guests.</i>
<i>All right, I'm on my way.</i>

655
01:19:27,227 --> 01:19:30,685
<i>Don't let him eat anyone else</i>
<i>till I get down there.</i>

656
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:34,222
Haku is bleeding
all over the carpet.

657
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:37,236
<i>Get him out of here.</i>
<i>He'll be dead soon anyway.</i>

658
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:57,386
- Ahh.

659
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:02,760
Hi, sweetie.
Hiding under the cushions again?

660
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:10,800
Oh, I woke you,
and you were sound asleep.

661
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,839
I'm sorry.
Let me give you a kiss.

662
01:20:16,776 --> 01:20:18,676
Go back to sleep, now.

663
01:20:48,174 --> 01:20:50,165
Ow! Let go of me!

664
01:20:50,243 --> 01:20:53,804
Wow, you're a big baby.
Would you mind letting go of me?

665
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,611
- I'm in a really big hurry.
- You came in here to make me sick.

666
01:20:57,684 --> 01:21:00,847
- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from outside, aren't you?

667
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,616
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.

668
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,624
Now, would you please let go of me?

669
01:21:05,692 --> 01:21:08,354
You'll get sick if you go outside.

670
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:10,362
So stay here and play with me.

671
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,955
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

672
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:14,967
That's why I've never left this room.

673
01:21:15,035 --> 01:21:17,833
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

674
01:21:17,904 --> 01:21:21,806
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

675
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,776
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

676
01:21:24,844 --> 01:21:27,836
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me...

677
01:21:27,914 --> 01:21:30,280
and Mama will come in here and kill you.

678
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:33,786
- Play with me, or I'll break your arm.
- That hurts!

679
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:35,912
Please! I'll play with you later, okay?

680
01:21:35,989 --> 01:21:40,153
- No, I wanna play now!

681
01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:43,992
- Germs! I've got germs, see?

682
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:57,166
Haku!

683
01:21:57,243 --> 01:22:00,542
What are you doing? Get away!
Get back! Haku, are you okay?

684
01:22:00,613 --> 01:22:02,604
- Can you hear me?

685
01:22:02,682 --> 01:22:05,048
- Shut your mouth! Haku!

686
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:11,548
- Get back!

687
01:22:13,726 --> 01:22:16,524
Stop it!

688
01:22:30,443 --> 01:22:34,379
I'm not afraid of germs.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

689
01:22:34,447 --> 01:22:36,381
Please don't cry. Just wait.

690
01:22:36,449 --> 01:22:39,475
Right now, or I'll start crying.

691
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:43,655
Don't cry! Don't cry!

692
01:22:43,723 --> 01:22:46,624
What a spoiled brat!

693
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:49,355
Shut your big mouth!

694
01:22:49,429 --> 01:22:51,590
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

695
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:01,298
- Hmm. Still see-through.
- Mama?

696
01:23:01,374 --> 01:23:06,471
You pea-brain. Can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

697
01:23:13,586 --> 01:23:17,113
There, now. Your body
matches your brain.

698
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:20,455
Let's see.
What else can we mess with?

699
01:23:38,511 --> 01:23:40,445
This is our little secret.

700
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:43,311
You tell anyone else,
and I'll rip your mouth out.

701
01:23:45,051 --> 01:23:48,919
- Who are you?
- Zaneba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

702
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:52,617
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

703
01:23:52,692 --> 01:23:54,626
Now, hand him over to me.

704
01:23:54,694 --> 01:23:57,185
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

705
01:23:57,263 --> 01:24:01,097
Too bad. He stole my solid gold seal.

706
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:03,829
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

707
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:06,804
Haku wouldn't steal.
He's a good person.

708
01:24:06,873 --> 01:24:11,003
Huh! Do you know why he became
my sister's apprentice?

709
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:15,514
To steal her magic secrets,
and now he's stolen my magic too.

710
01:24:15,582 --> 01:24:19,746
<i>He's a greedy little thief.</i>
<i>There's nothing good about him.</i>

711
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:24,779
Step aside, little girl.
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

712
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:29,988
There's a spell on the seal,
and anyone who steals it will die.

713
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:32,998
- No, you can't!

714
01:24:39,672 --> 01:24:43,164
You idiots! What's your problem?

715
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:47,043
<i>Keep quiet. I don't want my sister</i>
<i>coming up here.</i>

716
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:55,013
Ow. A paper cut.

717
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:57,482
Haku, we're falling!

718
01:25:17,076 --> 01:25:18,976
Haku!

719
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,134
- What's going on here? Sen, be careful! Stay back!
- Haku!

720
01:25:51,444 --> 01:25:54,413
Are you okay? Haku!

721
01:25:57,483 --> 01:26:00,714
- What's wrong with you?

722
01:26:03,089 --> 01:26:05,523
This looks serious.

723
01:26:07,226 --> 01:26:10,423
Haku, don't give up!
What do we do? Is he dying?

724
01:26:10,496 --> 01:26:13,829
It looks like he's bleeding
from the inside.

725
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,303
- From the inside?
- I think so. Maybe he swallowed something.

726
01:26:18,371 --> 01:26:22,068
Haku, I got this gift
from the river spirit.

727
01:26:22,141 --> 01:26:24,166
Eat it. Maybe it'll help.

728
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:28,679
Come on! Open your mouth!

729
01:26:28,748 --> 01:26:31,512
Please, Haku! Eat it!

730
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:35,086
See? It's okay.

731
01:26:35,154 --> 01:26:37,418
Medicine from the river spirit.

732
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:40,755
Open your mouth. That's it.

733
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:46,329
Got it.

734
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:48,560
- Now swallow.

735
01:27:06,152 --> 01:27:09,178
- Sen, look there!

736
01:27:19,832 --> 01:27:23,563
- The gold seal!
- Get that black slug! Over there! Get it!

737
01:27:23,636 --> 01:27:26,469
<i>Get it!</i>
<i>Get it!</i>

738
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:43,277
<i>You killed it?</i>
<i>Those things are bad luck.</i>

739
01:27:43,356 --> 01:27:45,916
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

740
01:27:45,992 --> 01:27:49,484
<i>Put your thumbs</i>
<i>and forefingers together.</i>

741
01:27:49,562 --> 01:27:53,965
- Evil, be gone!
- Haku stole this seal from Yubaba's sister.

742
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:56,968
Zaneba's solid gold
monogrammed seal.

743
01:27:57,036 --> 01:27:59,732
<i>That's as powerful as it gets.</i>

744
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:03,875
Look! He's changed back.

745
01:28:03,943 --> 01:28:05,877
Help me. What do we do?

746
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:10,574
- Haku! Haku, wake up!

747
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:14,711
Zaneba put a curse on the seal.

748
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:18,587
That's strong magic.
It's made him gravely ill.

749
01:28:27,934 --> 01:28:30,732
That should make him
more comfortable.

750
01:28:33,473 --> 01:28:37,068
Poor Haku. He's had it
hard ever since he got here.

751
01:28:37,143 --> 01:28:41,204
He just showed up
out of nowhere, just like you did.

752
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,512
<i>But he got mixed up with Yubaba.</i>
<i>He took a job as her apprentice.</i>

753
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:48,179
<i>I warned him it was too dangerous.</i>
<i>"Just quit.</i>

754
01:28:48,254 --> 01:28:50,586
<i>Go back home, "I told him.</i>

755
01:28:50,656 --> 01:28:54,752
<i>But he said for some reason</i>
<i>he had no home to return to.</i>

756
01:28:54,827 --> 01:28:57,091
<i>Once Yubaba</i>
<i>got control over him...</i>

757
01:28:57,163 --> 01:29:00,997
<i>his face turned pale</i>
<i>and his eyes turned steely.</i>

758
01:29:01,067 --> 01:29:04,298
<i>- He's never been the same.</i>

759
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:08,363
Kamajii, what if I take
the gold seal back to Zaneba?

760
01:29:08,441 --> 01:29:12,104
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

761
01:29:12,178 --> 01:29:14,237
Can you tell me
where Zaneba lives?

762
01:29:14,313 --> 01:29:16,645
You'd go to Zaneba's?

763
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:20,208
- It might help, but she's one dangerous witch.
- Please?

764
01:29:20,286 --> 01:29:24,450
Haku helped me before.
Now I wanna help him.

765
01:29:24,524 --> 01:29:26,617
Hmm.

766
01:29:26,692 --> 01:29:31,891
I know how you can get there,
but you'll have to get back on your own.

767
01:29:31,964 --> 01:29:34,455
Wait here.

768
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:39,164
Let's see, now. I know it's
around here somewhere.

769
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:42,901
Everyone, I need my shoes
and clothes, please.

770
01:29:44,777 --> 01:29:47,268
I guess my parents will have to wait.

771
01:29:51,484 --> 01:29:54,146
Sen! I've looked everywhere for you.

772
01:29:56,889 --> 01:29:59,016
- Rin!
- There's blood everywhere.

773
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:02,424
What's going on here?
Who are those guys?

774
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:05,794
I picked up some new friends. See?

775
01:30:05,865 --> 01:30:09,266
- Everyone's looking for you. Yubaba is furious.
- Huh?

776
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:13,032
The guy with all the gold turned out
to be a monster called "No-Face."

777
01:30:13,105 --> 01:30:16,233
And he says that <i>you</i>
let him into the bathhouse.

778
01:30:18,678 --> 01:30:20,612
I did let him in.

779
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,648
Are you serious?

780
01:30:22,715 --> 01:30:24,774
Yeah. I thought he was a customer.

781
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,819
What? He's a monster.
He's already swallowed three people.

782
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:31,516
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

783
01:30:31,591 --> 01:30:36,051
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

784
01:30:36,128 --> 01:30:39,325
You've got train tickets?
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

785
01:30:39,398 --> 01:30:41,958
I've been saving them
for 40 years.

786
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:45,697
Now, listen carefully. The train stop
you want is called Swamp Bottom.

787
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:48,171
- Swamp Bottom?
<i>- That's where Zaneba lives.</i>

788
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,174
<i>- The sixth stop.</i>
- Sixth stop.

789
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:53,837
Make sure you get it right.
The train used to run in both directions...

790
01:30:53,913 --> 01:30:55,938
but these days it's a one-way ride.

791
01:30:56,015 --> 01:30:57,949
Still want to go?

792
01:30:58,017 --> 01:31:02,613
Yep. I'll walk back along the tracks.

793
01:31:02,688 --> 01:31:06,749
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

794
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:10,762
Haku, I'll be back soon.
Just hold on.

795
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:13,264
What's going on?

796
01:31:13,332 --> 01:31:16,130
Something you wouldn't recognize.
It's called "love."

797
01:31:23,843 --> 01:31:26,641
- He just keeps getting bigger!
- I'm scared.

798
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:29,146
- I don't wanna be eaten by it.
- It's her.

799
01:31:37,156 --> 01:31:40,125
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

800
01:31:42,495 --> 01:31:44,486
<i>There's no need to get upset.</i>

801
01:31:44,563 --> 01:31:48,158
<i>- I'm sure they'll find Sen somewhere.</i>

802
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:50,429
<i>Where is Sen? I want Sen!</i>

803
01:31:50,503 --> 01:31:52,403
Hurry! This way!

804
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:01,309
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

805
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:06,249
Sen has arrived, sir. She'll be
with you in just a few minutes.

806
01:32:06,318 --> 01:32:10,220
- He's destroying everything.
It's costing us a fortune.

807
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:14,248
So suck up to him and get every last
speck of gold he's...

808
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:19,764
Ew! What's that dirty mouse doing here?

809
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:23,290
Huh? He's your...
He doesn't look familiar?

810
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:27,863
Familiar? Don't be stupid.
Now, get in there.

811
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,866
Here's Sen.

812
01:32:31,944 --> 01:32:35,175
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

813
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:38,182
- You wanna take her place? Hmph!
- Huh?

814
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,864
Try this. It's delicious.

815
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:06,972
Want some gold? I'm not giving it
to anybody else.

816
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:14,110
Come closer, Sen.
What would you like?

817
01:33:14,186 --> 01:33:16,518
Just name it.

818
01:33:16,589 --> 01:33:18,682
I would like to leave, sir.

819
01:33:18,758 --> 01:33:21,249
I have someplace
I need to go to right away, please.

820
01:33:23,362 --> 01:33:26,092
You should go back
to where you came from.

821
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:30,795
Yubaba doesn't want you
in the bathhouse any longer.

822
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:34,101
Where is your home?
Don't you have any friends or family?

823
01:33:35,508 --> 01:33:38,238
No. No!

824
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:41,040
I'm lonely.
I'm lonely.

825
01:33:43,215 --> 01:33:45,274
What is it that you want?

826
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:48,684
I want Sen.
I want Sen!

827
01:33:49,955 --> 01:33:51,946
Take the gold. Take it!

828
01:33:52,024 --> 01:33:54,618
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

829
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:56,888
- Ooh! Huh?

830
01:33:58,831 --> 01:34:01,095
- Huh.
- Ow.

831
01:34:03,636 --> 01:34:06,571
If you want to eat me,
eat this first.

832
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,403
I was saving this for my parents...

833
01:34:09,475 --> 01:34:12,239
but I think you'd better have it.

834
01:34:32,498 --> 01:34:35,558
- Sen!

835
01:34:35,634 --> 01:34:38,034
Sen, what did you do to me?

836
01:34:40,306 --> 01:34:42,240
Aah!

837
01:34:53,853 --> 01:34:56,253
Enough! I don't care if he's rich!

838
01:34:57,489 --> 01:34:59,980
This nonsense has gotta stop!

839
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:14,438
<i>No-Face!</i>

840
01:35:14,506 --> 01:35:16,940
Over here!

841
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:26,283
Run for your life!

842
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:57,648
Now, that's an esophagus!

843
01:36:00,085 --> 01:36:02,986
I'll get you for this, Sen!

844
01:36:05,224 --> 01:36:07,215
Duck!

845
01:36:17,202 --> 01:36:19,102
Excuse me.

846
01:36:20,306 --> 01:36:22,240
Sen, this way!

847
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:40,590
Hey, over here!

848
01:36:40,659 --> 01:36:42,593
Sen, don't call him over!

849
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:49,133
I think being in the bathhouse
makes him crazy.

850
01:36:49,201 --> 01:36:51,135
He needs to get out of there.

851
01:36:51,203 --> 01:36:53,797
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

852
01:36:53,872 --> 01:36:58,104
You don't know? Great.
Now he's following us.

853
01:36:58,177 --> 01:37:00,111
<i>He won't hurt us.</i>

854
01:37:12,024 --> 01:37:14,788
Hmm?

855
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,658
- You'll have to walk from here.
- Okay.

856
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,857
The station's just down the tracks.

857
01:37:19,932 --> 01:37:21,866
Thanks, Rin.

858
01:37:21,934 --> 01:37:25,870
- You better come back, you hear me?
- I will.

859
01:37:28,874 --> 01:37:34,005
Sen, I'm sorry I called you
a dope before! I take it back!

860
01:37:42,187 --> 01:37:46,283
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

861
01:37:49,628 --> 01:37:52,188
There's the station.

862
01:38:02,307 --> 01:38:04,298
Here comes the train. Come on.

863
01:38:26,965 --> 01:38:30,662
Oh. We'd like to go
to Swamp Bottom, please.

864
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:37,272
Huh?

865
01:38:37,342 --> 01:38:39,867
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

866
01:38:39,945 --> 01:38:42,379
He'd like to come too, please.

867
01:39:19,218 --> 01:39:21,448
Uh... Uh...

868
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:26,416
Sit here. Behave yourself, okay?

869
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,741
- Kamajii, wake up.
- Hmm?

870
01:41:32,517 --> 01:41:36,783
- Haku, you're all right.
- I'm fine. Where is Sen?

871
01:41:36,855 --> 01:41:39,756
Did she go somewhere?
Can you tell me what's going on?

872
01:41:39,825 --> 01:41:42,885
You blacked out, remember?

873
01:41:42,961 --> 01:41:45,759
Yeah, I remember being in darkness.

874
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:48,891
Then I could hear Sen's voice
calling out my name.

875
01:41:48,967 --> 01:41:51,162
So I followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew...

876
01:41:51,236 --> 01:41:53,170
I was lying here
feeling better than ever.

877
01:41:53,238 --> 01:41:57,231
Pure love. It broke Zaneba's spell.

878
01:41:57,309 --> 01:42:00,301
Sen left to return the golden seal.

879
01:42:00,379 --> 01:42:02,574
She did it to save you.

880
01:42:02,648 --> 01:42:06,015
<i>This gold doesn't even come close...</i>

881
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:09,520
<i>to covering the damage</i>
<i>that stupid No-Face caused.</i>

882
01:42:09,588 --> 01:42:12,421
Sen didn't get nearly enough.
She'll have to be punished.

883
01:42:12,491 --> 01:42:16,689
- Madam, you see, Sen was the one
that saved us from No-Face. - Yes, yes.

884
01:42:16,762 --> 01:42:20,528
So what?
This whole mess is her fault.

885
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:23,159
And now she's run away from here.

886
01:42:23,235 --> 01:42:25,601
She's even abandoned
her own parents!

887
01:42:25,671 --> 01:42:28,868
<i>- Those pigs must be ready</i>
<i>to eat by now.</i>

888
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:32,706
<i>- Turn them into bacon.</i>
- Wait a minute.

889
01:42:32,778 --> 01:42:34,712
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

890
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:38,978
You're still alive?
What is it you want?

891
01:42:39,051 --> 01:42:42,487
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

892
01:42:42,554 --> 01:42:45,921
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

893
01:42:45,991 --> 01:42:48,391
Since when do you talk
that way to your master?

894
01:42:57,436 --> 01:42:59,927
Huh.

895
01:43:40,178 --> 01:43:42,408
My baby!

896
01:43:44,316 --> 01:43:46,876
No!

897
01:43:48,787 --> 01:43:50,721
- My baby!
- It's just dirt.

898
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:53,815
Where's my baby?

899
01:43:53,892 --> 01:43:56,827
Where are you, sweetie?

900
01:43:58,063 --> 01:44:00,964
Come out! Please, come out!

901
01:44:01,032 --> 01:44:02,932
Where are you?

902
01:44:05,871 --> 01:44:09,398
Sweetie!
Sweetie pie!

903
01:44:12,978 --> 01:44:15,208
You!

904
01:44:17,783 --> 01:44:22,277
Where is he?

905
01:44:23,822 --> 01:44:28,384
What did you do with my baby?

906
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:30,394
He's with your sister.

907
01:44:30,462 --> 01:44:32,487
Zaneba?

908
01:44:36,134 --> 01:44:38,068
Uh...

909
01:44:53,785 --> 01:44:56,982
Very clever, Haku. I get it.

910
01:44:57,055 --> 01:44:59,922
You'll get my baby back for me,
but at a price.

911
01:44:59,991 --> 01:45:03,688
So, what do you want?

912
01:45:03,762 --> 01:45:06,196
Tear up Sen's contract.

913
01:45:06,264 --> 01:45:10,724
And then I want you to return Sen and her
mother and father back to the human world.

914
01:45:10,802 --> 01:45:13,270
Fine, but on one condition.

915
01:45:13,338 --> 01:45:17,274
<i>I get to give Sen one final test.</i>

916
01:45:17,342 --> 01:45:19,242
<i>If she fails, she's mine.</i>

917
01:46:03,188 --> 01:46:06,089
I hope this is the right stop.

918
01:46:07,225 --> 01:46:09,216
Let's go.

919
01:46:35,253 --> 01:46:38,051
You can ride on my shoulder
if you're tired.

920
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:47,598
Hmm?

921
01:47:55,367 --> 01:47:57,301
<i>Come in.</i>

922
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:03,765
Hello?

923
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:08,705
<i>Hurry up. I don't have all day.</i>

924
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:10,680
Come on.

925
01:48:13,618 --> 01:48:16,416
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

926
01:48:16,488 --> 01:48:19,889
Sit down. I'll make some tea.

927
01:48:26,398 --> 01:48:30,129
Excuse me, ma'am. Haku stole this
from you. I came to give it back.

928
01:48:30,201 --> 01:48:32,863
I see.

929
01:48:32,937 --> 01:48:35,872
Do you have any idea what this is?

930
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:39,171
Yes. It's the golden seal
you were looking for.

931
01:48:39,244 --> 01:48:43,203
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm very sorry.

932
01:48:43,281 --> 01:48:47,149
He sliced me in two, you know,
and I'm still angry.

933
01:48:47,218 --> 01:48:50,745
- What?
- What? The protective spell is gone.

934
01:48:50,822 --> 01:48:54,986
I'm sorry. You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

935
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:56,994
I think I squashed it with my foot.

936
01:48:57,062 --> 01:48:59,292
Squashed it?

937
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,793
That wasn't my slug.

938
01:49:03,868 --> 01:49:08,066
My sister put that slug into Haku
so she could control him.

939
01:49:08,139 --> 01:49:10,972
You squashed it.

940
01:49:13,044 --> 01:49:15,342
What happened to my spell?

941
01:49:15,413 --> 01:49:18,143
Only love can break it.
Come, now.

942
01:49:18,216 --> 01:49:22,949
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

943
01:49:23,021 --> 01:49:26,115
The spell on those two
wore off long ago.

944
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:29,126
Change back if you want.

945
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:37,691
I don't get along with my sister.

946
01:49:37,769 --> 01:49:39,930
She's so obnoxious.

947
01:49:40,004 --> 01:49:42,336
You saw how tacky her home is.

948
01:49:42,407 --> 01:49:45,467
- We're identical twins,
yet exact opposites.

949
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:52,575
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

950
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:56,017
But there's nothing I can do.
It's just the way things are.

951
01:49:56,087 --> 01:49:59,147
You'll have to help your parents
and Haku on your own.

952
01:49:59,224 --> 01:50:01,215
Use what you remember
about them.

953
01:50:01,292 --> 01:50:04,261
What? Can't you please
give me more of a hint than that?

954
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:08,265
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

955
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:10,267
That's a good start.

956
01:50:10,335 --> 01:50:14,203
Once you've met someone,
you never really forget them.

957
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:17,867
It just takes a while
for your memories to return.

958
01:50:17,942 --> 01:50:21,969
<i>While you're thinking, the boys</i>
<i>and I are going to make you something.</i>

959
01:50:22,046 --> 01:50:25,243
<i>And I want you</i>
<i>to call me Granny from now on.</i>

960
01:50:28,753 --> 01:50:30,846
<i>- Ah, come on. Keep at it.</i>

961
01:50:33,792 --> 01:50:38,729
No-Face, where did you learn to spin thread?
You're really good at this.

962
01:50:38,797 --> 01:50:42,494
<i>Now let's weave</i>
<i>the threads together.</i>

963
01:50:43,835 --> 01:50:46,565
Knit one, pearl two.
Knit one, pearl two.

964
01:50:46,638 --> 01:50:48,572
Knit one... That's right.

965
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,768
Granny, I can't remember
anything at all.

966
01:50:51,843 --> 01:50:55,802
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

967
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:59,816
My mom and dad could've
been eaten for dinner.

968
01:51:01,286 --> 01:51:03,720
Wait just a little bit longer.

969
01:51:03,788 --> 01:51:05,688
Ahh. There we go.

970
01:51:05,757 --> 01:51:08,590
Use it to tie back your hair.

971
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:14,664
It's beautiful.

972
01:51:14,732 --> 01:51:16,859
It'll protect you.

973
01:51:16,935 --> 01:51:19,768
It's made from the threads
your friends wove together.

974
01:51:19,838 --> 01:51:21,772
Thank you.

975
01:51:30,648 --> 01:51:33,776
What good timing.
We've got another guest.

976
01:51:33,852 --> 01:51:36,912
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

977
01:51:48,633 --> 01:51:53,161
Haku! Haku.

978
01:51:53,238 --> 01:51:55,536
Thank goodness.

979
01:51:55,607 --> 01:51:59,202
You're alive! I can't believe it.
How did it happen?

980
01:51:59,277 --> 01:52:01,211
Ahh.

981
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:03,713
That's love for you.

982
01:52:03,781 --> 01:52:07,080
Look, Granny. Haku's alive.

983
01:52:07,151 --> 01:52:11,110
- Haku, I will forgive you
for stealing my precious seal.

984
01:52:11,189 --> 01:52:14,625
But in return,
you must take care of this girl.

985
01:52:14,692 --> 01:52:18,253
Okay, you two,
it's time to go home.

986
01:52:18,329 --> 01:52:20,661
Come back soon.

987
01:52:20,732 --> 01:52:23,530
No-Face,
why don't you stay with me?

988
01:52:23,601 --> 01:52:26,627
- I could use a good helper.

989
01:52:26,704 --> 01:52:28,638
Granny!

990
01:52:28,706 --> 01:52:31,436
Thank you so much. I'll miss you.

991
01:52:31,509 --> 01:52:34,876
Don't worry. You'll be all right, Sen.

992
01:52:34,946 --> 01:52:38,279
I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

993
01:52:38,349 --> 01:52:40,840
Chihiro. What a pretty name.

994
01:52:40,919 --> 01:52:43,683
- You take good care of it.
- I will.

995
01:52:43,755 --> 01:52:46,656
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

996
01:52:46,724 --> 01:52:51,184
Granny, take care!
Thanks for everything!

997
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:40,735
Haku, listen.

998
01:53:40,812 --> 01:53:44,646
I just remembered something from a long time ago.
I think it may help you.

999
01:53:44,716 --> 01:53:48,652
<i>Once, when I was little,</i>
<i>I dropped my shoe into a river.</i>

1000
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:52,212
And when I tried
to get it back, I fell in.

1001
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:55,885
I thought I'd drown, but the water
carried me to shore.

1002
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,554
It finally came back to me.

1003
01:53:58,629 --> 01:54:01,723
The river's name was
the Kalaku River.

1004
01:54:01,799 --> 01:54:05,633
<i>I think that was you,</i>
<i>and your real name is Kalaku River!</i>

1005
01:54:26,758 --> 01:54:29,318
You did it, Chihiro! I remember.

1006
01:54:29,394 --> 01:54:31,692
I was the spirit of the Kalaku River.

1007
01:54:31,763 --> 01:54:35,392
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kalaku River.

1008
01:54:35,466 --> 01:54:38,162
They filled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

1009
01:54:38,236 --> 01:54:41,034
That must be why I can't
find my way home, Chihiro.

1010
01:54:41,105 --> 01:54:44,734
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

1011
01:54:44,809 --> 01:54:47,972
So you're the one who carried me back
into shallow water.

1012
01:54:48,046 --> 01:54:51,379
You saved me.
I knew you were good.

1013
01:55:24,215 --> 01:55:26,615
- Hey, there they are!

1014
01:55:38,396 --> 01:55:41,957
I see you failed
to bring my baby back.

1015
01:55:44,402 --> 01:55:46,802
- Mama!
- My baby!

1016
01:55:46,871 --> 01:55:51,001
Are you traumatized?
Did they do terrible things to you?

1017
01:55:51,075 --> 01:55:54,272
You're standing all by yourself.
When did that happen?

1018
01:55:54,345 --> 01:55:56,779
Don't forget your promise.

1019
01:55:56,848 --> 01:56:00,045
You must return Chihiro
and her parents to the human world.

1020
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:03,417
Hmph! Not so fast, Haku.

1021
01:56:03,488 --> 01:56:05,649
I get to give Sen one final test.

1022
01:56:05,723 --> 01:56:08,123
- Shut up!

1023
01:56:08,192 --> 01:56:10,490
Stop it, Mama. Leave her alone.

1024
01:56:10,561 --> 01:56:14,156
- Sen and I had a really good time.

1025
01:56:14,232 --> 01:56:17,133
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

1026
01:56:17,201 --> 01:56:19,396
I have to give Sen one final test.

1027
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,803
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1028
01:56:22,874 --> 01:56:27,277
- But... Granny?
<i>- Hey, Granny!</i>

1029
01:56:27,345 --> 01:56:29,745
You're right. A deal's a deal.

1030
01:56:41,125 --> 01:56:43,355
Okay, I'm ready. I'll take your test.

1031
01:56:43,427 --> 01:56:45,361
Hmm. You've got guts.

1032
01:56:45,429 --> 01:56:48,830
I've got your contract right here.
Come this way.

1033
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,835
This'll only take a minute.

1034
01:56:51,903 --> 01:56:54,394
Don't worry.

1035
01:56:57,675 --> 01:57:01,509
See if you can tell which of these pigs
is your mother and father.

1036
01:57:10,755 --> 01:57:12,689
You get one try.

1037
01:57:12,757 --> 01:57:15,157
If you get it right,
you can all go home.

1038
01:57:25,736 --> 01:57:28,500
Huh? There must be a mistake.

1039
01:57:28,573 --> 01:57:30,666
None of these pigs
are my mom or dad.

1040
01:57:30,741 --> 01:57:34,404
None of them?
Is that really your answer?

1041
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:38,574
- Mm-hmm.

1042
01:57:39,984 --> 01:57:43,112
Oh, you got it!

1043
01:57:48,926 --> 01:57:51,087
Thank you, everyone.

1044
01:57:51,162 --> 01:57:54,598
All right, you win.
Get out of my sight.

1045
01:57:54,665 --> 01:57:58,658
Thanks for everything, Granny. Good-bye!

1046
01:57:58,736 --> 01:58:01,671
- Good-bye!
- Thank you!

1047
01:58:01,739 --> 01:58:03,730
- Haku!
- Let's go!

1048
01:58:03,808 --> 01:58:07,005
- Where are my mom and dad?
- When you passed the test...

1049
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:09,103
they woke up
on the human side of the river.

1050
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:11,614
They're there now,
and they're looking for you.

1051
01:58:11,682 --> 01:58:14,310
There's no water here.

1052
01:58:14,385 --> 01:58:17,616
- I can walk across now.
- But I can't go any farther.

1053
01:58:17,688 --> 01:58:20,054
Just go back the way you came.
You'll be fine.

1054
01:58:20,124 --> 01:58:23,582
But you have to promise not to look back,
not until you've passed through the tunnel.

1055
01:58:23,661 --> 01:58:25,822
What about you? What'll you do?

1056
01:58:25,896 --> 01:58:29,195
Don't worry. I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

1057
01:58:29,267 --> 01:58:31,758
I'll tell her I'm going
to quit being her apprentice.

1058
01:58:31,836 --> 01:58:34,236
I'm fine. I got my name back.

1059
01:58:34,305 --> 01:58:36,796
- Will we meet again sometime?
- Sure we will.

1060
01:58:36,874 --> 01:58:38,808
- Promise?
- Promise.

1061
01:58:38,876 --> 01:58:40,776
Now go, and don't look back.

1062
01:59:03,267 --> 01:59:05,201
<i>- Chihiro!</i>

1063
01:59:05,269 --> 01:59:08,204
Where have you been?
Hurry up!

1064
01:59:11,342 --> 01:59:13,572
<i>Mom, Dad!</i>

1065
01:59:13,644 --> 01:59:17,341
- You shouldn't run off like that, honey.
- You could get in big trouble.

1066
01:59:17,415 --> 01:59:19,781
Are you guys sure you're all right?

1067
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:22,785
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>I don't wanna miss the movers.</i>

1068
01:59:32,863 --> 01:59:35,024
Chihiro, hurry up.

1069
01:59:43,841 --> 01:59:46,537
Everybody, watch your step.

1070
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:49,374
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

1071
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:04,386
We made it.
Hey, what happened?

1072
02:00:04,462 --> 02:00:06,396
What is it?

1073
02:00:06,464 --> 02:00:08,398
Look at that.

1074
