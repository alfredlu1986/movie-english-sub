1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,560
<i>One con under escort.
Open gate one.</i>

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>Man walking.</i>

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>Open gate two.</i>

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,280
<i>Let's go. Face the wall.
Got one under escort.</i>

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,600
- Good morning.
- Morning.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
- State your name for the record.
- Daniel Ocean.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,240
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,440
...whether you are
likely to break the law again.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,920
This was your first conviction,
but you've been implicated...

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,920
...in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,200
What can you tell us about this?

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,720
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,160
We're trying to find out...

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,160
...if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200
...or just a reason
you got caught this time.

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,120
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,640
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,200
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:49,360
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,320
- Chips, please.
- Sure.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,520
- Change 150. Quarters or nickels?
- Quarters are fine.

22
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,760
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,080
20. Dealer has 19.
Good start.

24
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,160
- I'm going on break now.
- Here. Thank you very much.

25
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,720
- Good luck.
- You have a good one.

26
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,240
- How are you, sir?
- Hello, Frank.

27
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,000
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,360
My name is Ramón.
As you can see right here.

29
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,960
- My mistake.
- No problem, sir.

30
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
The table's cold anyway.

31
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,160
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00.

32
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,760
- 1:00?
- Yes, sir.

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,880
Thanks, Ramón.

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,840
Thank you.

35
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,160
- Checking up on current events?
- Ramón?

36
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,120
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,920
- You just got out?
- This afternoon.

38
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
You seen him?

39
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,720
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

40
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,640
You have a plan already?

41
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

42
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
<i>Officer Brooks...</i>

43
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,760
...this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,880
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,080
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,920
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

47
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,960
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

48
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

49
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,480
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager...

50
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,040
- Bernie?
- Not Bernie. My business manager.

51
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
Actually, they're both named Bernie.

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
He said what we do could
be considered research...

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,160
...for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

54
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,080
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

55
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,680
...but I'd have to pay you by check.

56
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,440
Or we could just stick to cash.

57
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,520
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

58
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,320
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

59
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,760
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

60
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,200
Josh. To the left.

61
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,600
Deal to your left.

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,320
- Shane?
- Hit me.

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,640
- It's not blackjack.
- Dude!

64
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,240
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

65
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
- Left. Left.
- Left, I'll get it.

66
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

67
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,240
- Blue.
- Blue, that's a 50.

68
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,240
- I'll call?
- Okay.

69
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,360
Shane's calling. 50.

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,920
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

71
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,080
That's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

72
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, thanks, man.

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
- Right.
- How many?

74
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,920
- Four.
- You don't want four. You wanna fold.

75
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
- I wanna fold?
- Fold.

76
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
Is that good?

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,640
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

78
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,120
You're done.
You have three pairs.

79
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,880
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

80
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,000
- Maybe one was mine.
- Wasn't me.

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,480
Fellas!

82
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,560
All reds.

83
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
What up, dog?

84
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,840
- How's the game going?
- Longest hour of my life.

86
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
- What?
- I'm running away with your wife.

87
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,960
Great.

88
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,080
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

89
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Not for me, dude.

90
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

91
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,560
...if that's cool with you.

92
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,000
What do you do for a living?
If you don't mind me asking.

93
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,440
Why would I mind you asking?

94
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
Two cards.

95
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,080
I just got out of prison.

96
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,480
- Really?
- Why were you in prison?

97
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,600
I stole things.

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,360
You stole things?
Like jewels?

99
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,280
Incan matrimonial head masks.

100
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,360
- Any money in Incan matrimonial...?
- Head masks. Some.

101
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Don't let him fool you.
There's loads if you can move them.

102
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,960
I'll take one. But you can't.

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,160
- My fence was confident.
- You don't need a fence.

104
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,760
- Some people lack vision.
- Everybody in cellblock E.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
That's $500.

106
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,120
- What's the first lesson in poker?
- Never bet on the...

107
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,800
- Leave emotion at the door.
- Right, Topher.

108
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,720
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

109
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,000
That much money, this early...

110
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,560
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,640
Barry?

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,480
All right.

113
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,920
I fold.

114
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,880
- Josh?
- Don't worry, I'm game.

115
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,960
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
...$500 of my own.
- That's a very handsome bet.

117
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,160
But don't push him too high, too fast.
Keep him on the leash.

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,920
- Holly?
- Call.

119
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,960
Call.

120
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
And I'll call.

121
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,360
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

122
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,840
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

124
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,440
- Josh?
- Two.

125
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
Thattagirl. Call.

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
- Call.
- Call.

127
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,920
Let's see them.

128
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

129
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,440
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

130
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,920
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

131
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,720
- God, I'm bored.
- You look bored.

132
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,720
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

133
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,440
Why do you think
I came to see you first?

134
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,960
<i>- So tell me.
- It's tricky.</i>

135
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,240
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

136
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,920
- Guns?
- Not quite. High security. The take...

137
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,880
- The target?
- Eight figures.

138
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,120
What's the target?

139
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,360
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

140
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,760
You want to knock over a casino?

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,400
The vault at the Bellagio.

142
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,800
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

143
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,000
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

144
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
You said three casinos?

145
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,720
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

146
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,480
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

147
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,680
- These are Terry Benedict's places.
- Yes, they are.

148
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,640
- Think he'll mind?
- More than somewhat.

149
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,760
You'd need at least 12 guys
doing a combination of cons.

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,560
Like what, you think?

151
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

152
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,360
...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

153
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,280
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

154
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,240
Where will you get
the money to back this?

155
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

156
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,000
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

157
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,400
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,560
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

159
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,160
Hey.

160
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,960
Oscar, lower it a bit,
would you?

161
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,080
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

162
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,240
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

163
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,840
- Whatever you need.
- Appreciate it.

164
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,240
What?

165
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I need a reason.

166
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,800
And don't say money. Why do this?

167
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
Why not do it?

168
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,640
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

169
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,320
...and you're cold-decking
"Teen Beat" cover boys.

170
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,760
Because the house always wins.

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

172
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,200
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

173
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,280
- You practiced that speech?
- Did I rush it?

174
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,360
It was good.
The "Teen Beat" thing was harsh.

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,520
I wonder what Reuben will say.

176
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,680
You're out of your damn minds!

177
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,560
You're both of you nuts!

178
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,960
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

179
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,960
And it cannot be beaten.

180
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

181
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,280
They got timers, vaults.

182
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,600
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

183
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,960
Okay, bad example.

184
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,560
It's never been tried.

185
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,200
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

186
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,960
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

187
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,080
Number three, the bronze medal.

188
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,280
Pencil neck grabs
a lockbox at the Horseshoe.

189
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,200
Grab the guy in the suit!

190
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,040
He got two steps closer
to the door than anyone before.

191
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
Leave the money!

192
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,480
Second most successful robbery:

193
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,960
The Flamingo in '71. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

194
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,440
...before they grabbed him.

195
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,920
Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.

196
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
Goddamn hippie.

197
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,400
And the closest any man has come
to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

198
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,280
...was outside of Caesars in '87.

199
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,360
He came...

200
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,480
...he grabbed...

201
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,960
...they conquered.

202
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,960
But what am I saying?
You guys are pros. The best.

203
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

204
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,360
Of course, lest we forget...

205
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,840
...once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

206
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
You're right.
He's right.

207
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,360
Our eyes were bigger
than our stomachs.

208
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,640
- That's what it is. Ego.
- Yeah, blah, blah.

209
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,680
- Thanks for lunch.
- The niçoise was delicious.

210
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
- Sorry to bother you.
- Look, we go way back...

211
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,480
...and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,040
- Our pleasure.
- I'd never been to Belize.

213
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,920
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

214
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,800
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

215
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,720
The Bellagio, the Mirage
and the MGM Grand.

216
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,280
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

217
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,320
- Is that right?
- That's right.

218
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,200
You guys...

219
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,080
...what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

220
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,760
What do you have against him?
That's the question.

221
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,520
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

222
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,960
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

223
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,520
- I see what you're doing.
- What are we doing?

224
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,280
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

225
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,440
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,160
But Benedict...

227
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,080
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

228
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,640
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

229
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,280
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

230
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Well-funded.

231
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,920
You gotta be nuts, too.

232
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,640
And you're gonna need
a crew as nuts as you are.

233
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,560
Who do you got in mind?

234
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,400
<i>- All right, who's in?
- Frank C. is in.</i>

235
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:50,320
<i>Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.</i>

236
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,280
<i>Drivers?</i>

237
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,960
<i>- I talked to the Malloys.
- Mormon twins?</i>

238
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,960
<i>They're in Utah, off the job.</i>

239
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,600
<i>They're having
trouble filling the hours.</i>

240
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,040
- Waiting, sweetheart.
- Good. Go.

241
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,560
- Waiting for you.
- Why?

242
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,560
- You're a little girl!
- Relax.

243
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

244
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
Relax.

245
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,240
<i>- Electronics?
- Livingston Dell.</i>

246
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,320
<i>He's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.</i>

247
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,080
<i>- How are his nerves?
- Not so bad.</i>

248
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
Move in a little bit.

249
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,440
- Don't touch that.
- Why not?

250
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Do you see me grabbing your gun
and waving it around?

251
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

252
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,480
Munitions.

253
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,800
- Phil Turrentine.
- Dead.

254
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,120
- No shit. On the job?
- Skin cancer.

255
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,160
- You send flowers?
- Dated his wife for a while.

256
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,720
Basher's in town.

257
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,840
There may be an issue
with availability.

258
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
All right, chaps...

259
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
...hang on to your knickers.

260
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,160
Oh, leave it out!

261
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,760
You tossers!
You had one job to do!

262
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,680
<i>That's all you used in the event?</i>

263
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,960
- You accusing me of booby-trapping?
- Well?

264
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

265
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
Basher?

266
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Peck. ATF.

267
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,320
Let me venture a guess.

268
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,120
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

269
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,320
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

270
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,560
...for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

271
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Stand back.

272
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,080
Here we go.

273
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,720
- Find Griggs. I need him.
- Who?

274
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,880
Just find him, will you?

275
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,520
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

276
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,360
Done.

277
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,200
- Is Danny about?
- He's around the corner.

278
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Terrific. It'll be nice working
with proper villains again.

279
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,240
Everybody down! Get down!

280
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,040
They weren't expecting that shit!

281
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

282
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,400
- Which one's the Amazing Yen?
- The little Chinese guy.

283
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
- Who else is on the list?
- He is the list.

284
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,960
It doesn't seem that diff...

285
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,840
- We got a grease man.
- We got a grease man.

286
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
We need Saul.

287
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,320
- He got out of the game a year ago.
- He get religion?

288
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,760
Ulcers.

289
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,800
- You could ask him.
- Hey, I could ask him.

290
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
I saw you at the paddock...

291
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,000
...before the second race, outside
the men's room when I placed my bet.

292
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,440
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

293
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,680
- How you been, Saul?
- Never better.

294
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,680
What's with the orange?

295
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,440
- My doctor says I need vitamins.
- Why don't you take vitamins?

296
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,000
You come here to give me a physical?

297
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,840
Box seats. Come on.

298
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,760
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

299
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,400
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

300
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,200
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

301
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,080
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

302
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm seeing a lady who works
the counter at Macy's.

303
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,480
I've changed.

304
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,040
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

305
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,000
Quit conning me.

306
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,480
That your hound way in the rear?

307
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,880
He breaks late.
Everyone knows this.

308
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,000
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

309
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,920
Tell me what the scam is?

310
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,880
<i>Exhibit C: His belt as king
of the heavyweight crown.</i>

311
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,800
<i>Lennox Lewis has proven
he's the champion.</i>

312
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,840
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

313
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,800
You think we need one more?

314
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,480
You think we need one more.

315
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
All right, we'll get one more.

316
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,000
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

317
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
- Who are you?
- A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

318
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,240
You're either in or out.
Right now.

319
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,480
- What is it?
- It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

320
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,280
- You're pretty trusting.
- Bobby has faith in you.

321
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,840
Fathers are like that.

322
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,680
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

323
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,640
Do this job,
he'll be trading on yours.

324
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
Don't, and you can go back
to feeling up stockbrokers.

325
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,240
Can you get the check, please?

326
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,120
That's the best lift you've made yet.

327
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,920
Las Vegas?

328
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,280
America's playground.

329
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,400
Did you guys get a group rate,
or something?

330
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,840
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

331
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,200
Not as often as I'd like.

332
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,160
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

333
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,880
I'll look into it.

334
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,680
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

335
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,000
Everybody sober?

336
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,560
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

337
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,160
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

338
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,000
If that's not your brand of vodka...

339
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,760
...eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

340
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,160
Otherwise, come with me.

341
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,960
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

342
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,800
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

343
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,360
- You like it there?
- Yeah.

344
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,960
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

345
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,720
The 3000 block
of Las Vegas Boulevard...

346
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,200
...also known as the Bellagio,
Mirage and MGM Grand.

347
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,920
They're three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

348
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,440
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

349
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,240
...beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

350
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,320
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

351
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,520
- We're gonna rob it.
- Smash-and-grab job?

352
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
Slightly more complicated than that.

353
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,760
Well, yeah.

354
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,960
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

355
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,520
Bad news first.

356
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,840
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

357
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,920
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

358
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,560
Next, through these doors...

359
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,000
...each one requiring a different
code changed every 12 hours.

360
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,760
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

361
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,480
- It won't move without fingerprint I.D.
- Which we can't fake.

362
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,480
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

363
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,120
Which we won't get.

364
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,240
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

365
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,120
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

366
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,600
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

367
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,080
Just two more guards with Uzis...

368
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,240
...and the most elaborate
vault door ever conceived.

369
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,560
Any questions?

370
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,560
Tunneling's out. There are...

371
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,760
...sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

372
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,760
- Anyone else?
- You mentioned good news?

373
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,200
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

374
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,800
...a casino to keep enough cash
to cover every chip on the floor.

375
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,680
That means on a weekday, by law,
it must carry...

376
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,640
...between $60 and $70 million
in cash and coin.

377
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,840
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

378
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,000
...in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

379
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,040
...$150 million,
without breaking a sweat.

380
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,800
There are 11 of us,
each with an equal share.

381
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,600
You do the math.

382
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,880
Exactly.

383
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,720
I have a question.

384
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,840
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

385
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,320
...down the elevator
we can't move...

386
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,840
...past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open...

387
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,240
- Without being seen by cameras.
- Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

388
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,960
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

389
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,640
...we're just supposed to walk out
of there with $150 million...

390
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,800
...without getting stopped?

391
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,840
Yeah.

392
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,040
Oh. Okay.

393
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,240
<i>First task: Reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...</i>

394
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,200
<i>... in all casinos,
from the dealers' rotation...</i>

395
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,320
<i>... to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.</i>

396
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,440
<i>Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.</i>

397
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,640
She dances at Crazy Horse Too,
to pay for school.

398
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,480
- I think she really likes me.
- Cool.

399
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,720
<i>Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.</i>

400
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,640
<i>Know the quick routes out.</i>

401
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,280
- He went through at 10:44.
- 10:46. Get a watch that works.

402
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,400
- You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
- 10:46.

403
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,560
<i>Second task: Power.</i>

404
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,080
<i>Fight night, we throw the switch
on Sin City. It's Basher's show.</i>

405
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,000
<i>You want broke, blind or bedlam?</i>

406
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,600
<i>- How about all three?
- Right, it's done.</i>

407
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,560
<i>Third task: Surveillance.</i>

408
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,640
<i>Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.</i>

409
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,240
<i>We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?</i>

410
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,920
Not the least accessible system
I've seen, but close.

411
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,360
- There's no closed-circuit I can tap?
- No.

412
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

413
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,960
Two. And one of them is lonely.

414
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

415
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,200
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

416
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,080
Watch it, bud!

417
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,080
- You call me bud, pal?
- You call me pal, friend?

418
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,080
- You call me friend, jackass?
- Don't call me jackass.

419
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,920
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

420
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,840
Copy that. I see them.

421
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,880
- Is that a word? You made that up?
- "Obsequious" is a word.

422
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,680
- Please move your balloons.
- You got in my way!

423
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,080
- I was trying to deliver my balloons!
- Gentlemen!

424
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,720
- He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
- You're spitting in my face.

425
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
And we're up and running.

426
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:17,600
- Why are hallways always that color?
- They say taupe is very soothing.

427
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,680
- Hi.
- Fine, thanks.

428
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
- Move the balloons.
- Move them?

429
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,520
I have a client waiting for these.

430
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,560
I don't have time to fool around
with you circus animals.

431
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,040
Hey! Hold up a minute!

432
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
Excuse me!

433
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,920
Hey! Excuse me!

434
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,320
- Hey, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

435
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,040
- How's the reception on those things?
- Excellent.

436
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,720
- Take care.
- Thanks.

437
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,320
- Well...
- Yeah.

438
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,440
<i>Fourth task: Construction.</i>

439
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,960
<i>We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.</i>

440
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,840
<i>- To practice?
- Something like that.</i>

441
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,680
<i>Fifth task: Intelligence.</i>

442
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,720
We need those codes, Linus,
from the guy who has all three.

443
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,120
- Who, Benedict?
- Learn to love his shadow.

444
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,080
- All I get to do is watch the guy?
- Gotta walk before you crawl.

445
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,040
- Reverse that.
- Sixth task: Transport.

446
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,200
Well, I am sorry, but $18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

447
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,480
Well, I understand.

448
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,080
- They are some great-looking vans.
- Yes, sir, top of the line.

449
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,120
- Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
- Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

450
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,440
- Denham like a jean.
- That's it. Just like the jean.

451
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,440
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

452
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,040
- I'm sorry?
- I've tried lots of lotion.

453
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

454
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,600
...she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

455
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,040
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

456
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,200
...but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

457
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,640
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

458
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,280
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash...

459
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,680
...I could drop that
down to seven...

460
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,360
Sixteen each.

461
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,840
- No?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,800
- You'd do that?
- Yes, sir.

463
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,600
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

464
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,840
- Well, I'm glad they did.
- They told me.

465
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,280
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

466
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,520
- You do that.
- Thank you.

467
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,200
- Very nice material.
- It's imported silk, Saul.

468
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,200
It's very nice.

469
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,560
Gentlemen, would you
excuse us for a second?

470
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,080
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

471
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,320
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

472
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,760
...you won't wake up
the following morning.

473
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,040
He's ready.

474
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,200
My name is Lyman.
Zerga.

475
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,480
<i>My name is Lyman Zerga.</i>

476
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,480
<i>My name is Lyman Zerga.</i>

477
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,080
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

478
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,680
That guy's a machine.

479
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,080
Good afternoon.

480
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,920
<i>He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.</i>

481
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,520
How are you, Tommy?

482
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,240
<i>He remembers every valet's name.</i>

483
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,120
<i>Not bad for a guy
worth 3/4 of a billion.</i>

484
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,880
<i>He works hard, hits
the lobby floor at 7 on the nose.</i>

485
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,080
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

486
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,360
<i>- Talks with his casino manager.
- About what?</i>

487
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,680
<i>All business.</i>

488
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,280
<i>Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.</i>

489
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,600
<i>There's rarely an incident he doesn't
know about or handle personally.</i>

490
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,840
<i>Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.</i>

491
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,240
<i>He speaks Spanish, German and Italian
and is getting good at Japanese.</i>

492
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>He's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.</i>

493
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,640
<i>Contents: Profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.</i>

494
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,080
Like I said, a machine.

495
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,640
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

496
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,440
And two minutes after they're changed,
he's got them.

497
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,440
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

498
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,800
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

499
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,760
...he seized his house
and bankrupted his...

500
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,480
In-law's dealership.

501
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,000
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

502
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,680
You scared?

503
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,000
You suicidal?

504
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,960
Only in the morning.

505
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,160
- Now what?
- Now comes the girl.

506
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,360
She comes down after him
if they're in a snit.

507
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,440
- Where does she come from?
- The museum, there. She's the curator.

508
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,360
Here she is.

509
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,800
This is the best part of my day.

510
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,560
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

511
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,520
Tess.

512
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,520
Huh?

513
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,840
Her name is Tess.

514
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,200
- We have to talk. Now.
- Okay.

515
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,640
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

516
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,360
Who?

517
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,240
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

518
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,360
...the guy who's screwing your wife.
- Ex-wife.

519
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,400
- Tell me.
- It's not about that.

520
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,080
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

521
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,440
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

522
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,000
Well, I lost something.

523
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,560
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

524
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,800
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

525
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,120
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

526
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,160
Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways.

527
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,320
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

528
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,680
- How did she look?
- She looked good.

529
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,640
Thanks.

530
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,200
You like it?

531
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,640
I like that you like it.

532
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,600
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

533
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,640
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

534
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,840
I'll see you tonight.

535
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,960
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

536
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,040
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

537
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,680
I don't believe in questions either.

538
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,040
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

539
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,800
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

540
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,720
He doesn't fool around.

541
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,840
- How are you, Eddie?
- Fine, sir.

542
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,320
Anything for me?

543
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,320
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

544
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,000
Who is he?

545
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,000
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

546
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,560
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

547
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,600
- One of the biggest.
- Zerga.

548
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,600
Yes, sir.

549
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,200
- Never heard of him.
- That's why I don't doubt it.

550
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,200
- He's staying here?
- He's in the Mirador suite.

551
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,160
- How's he doing?
- Up, almost 200.

552
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,760
Good for him.

553
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,960
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search...

554
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,960
Hello, Tess.

555
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,760
What are you doing here?

556
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,560
I'm out.

557
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,000
- Out?
- Of prison.

558
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,440
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

559
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,640
I don't smoke.
Don't sit.

560
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,240
- They say I paid my debt to society.
- Funny, I never got a check.

561
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,080
You're not wearing your ring.

562
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,160
I don't have a husband,
or didn't you get the papers?

563
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,400
- My last day inside.
- I told you I'd write.

564
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,600
- Danny, go now before...
- What? Benedict?

565
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,840
How you doing?
Whiskey and whiskey.

566
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,440
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

567
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,520
- Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
- Remind you of anyone?

568
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,640
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

569
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,280
- Monet.
- And Manet had syphilis.

570
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,360
They also painted occasionally.

571
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,840
All right, I'll make this quick.

572
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,360
I came here for you.

573
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,280
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

574
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,640
You're a thief and a liar.

575
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,920
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

576
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,400
- Steal?
- Lie.

577
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,000
Terry doesn't have to make
the distinction.

578
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,480
He's clear on both.

579
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,720
- You have a problem.
- Only one?

580
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:56,520
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

581
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,680
Does he make you laugh?

582
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,040
He doesn't make me cry.

583
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,080
- The fight is Saturday night?
- Yes, would you like tickets?

584
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,920
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

585
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,800
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

586
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,800
A black briefcase, standard size...

587
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,760
...the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

588
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'll put it in the house safe.

589
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,920
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

590
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,600
- I need something more secure.
- Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our...

591
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,440
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

592
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,360
...will not go overlooked.

593
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,680
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

594
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,440
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

595
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,200
I had to leave New York to escape.
How do I get my five years back?

596
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,440
- What you can do is not throw...
- You don't know anything.

597
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,280
You don't love me,
you want someone else.

598
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,240
- I must live with that. But not him.
- Spoken like a true ex-husband.

599
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,120
- I'm not joking.
- I'm not laughing.

600
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,120
There's a conflict of interest
when you give me love advice.

601
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,800
Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

602
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,000
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

603
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,280
- That I better know what I'm doing.
- Do you? Now?

604
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,280
You should go if you don't.

605
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,960
- I know what I'm doing.
- What are you doing?

606
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,800
Just catching up.

607
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,240
- Meet my ex-husband.
- Danny Ocean.

608
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,360
- Mr. Ocean.
- I'm in your seat.

609
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,880
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

610
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,200
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

611
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
- Is that so?
- Imagine the odds.

612
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,320
Of all the gin joints
in all the world.

613
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,040
You recently were
released from prison?

614
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,200
That's right.

615
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,320
- How does it feel to be out?
- About the same.

616
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,000
- Danny was just about to...
- I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

617
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,440
Stay, have a drink.

618
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,720
- I can't.
- He can't.

619
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,840
Well, then...

620
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,080
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

621
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,720
You never know.

622
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,880
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

623
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,640
So I should put
those towels back.

624
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,720
No, the towels you can keep.

625
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,880
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Take care, Danny.

626
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,640
- Terry.
- Danny.

627
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,600
Stinking...

628
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,680
<i>Tomorrow the day is yours.</i>

629
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,680
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

630
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,720
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

631
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,840
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

632
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:45,480
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

633
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,800
<i>Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...</i>

634
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,080
<i>... and its elevator shut down
for two minutes. That's when we go.</i>

635
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,360
You're in the middle of the room,
10 feet from everything.

636
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,520
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

637
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,280
What do you do?

638
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,880
- Ten says he shorts it.
- Twenty.

639
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,760
Window or aisle, boys?

640
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,120
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

641
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,960
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

642
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,600
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

643
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,520
- You understand him?
- I'll explain later.

644
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,680
They're so pony they blew
the backup grids one by one.

645
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,800
Basher, what happened?

646
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,120
<i>They did what I would have done
but by accident.</i>

647
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,200
<i>Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.</i>

648
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:05,240
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

649
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,200
Barney Rubble.
Trouble!

650
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,840
- We could always...
- By tomorrow?

651
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,040
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

652
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,280
What's a pinch?

653
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,800
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

654
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,440
Better yet, a pinch is
a bomb without the bomb.

655
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,560
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

656
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,840
...shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

657
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,920
It usually doesn't matter because
a nuclear weapon destroys everything.

658
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,480
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

659
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,840
...without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

660
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,360
...the 17th century.
- How long?

661
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,840
30 seconds.

662
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,560
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

663
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,200
- Like, for instance...
- Las Vegas?

664
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,680
Yeah, I think it might.

665
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,960
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

666
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,800
Where?

667
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,480
Let's go.
Yen, Basher, come on.

668
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,040
Where you going?

669
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,800
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

670
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,720
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

671
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,200
Start.

672
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,640
- I got one.
- You thinking of one?

673
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,000
- No, I've thought of one.
- You're thinking of one.

674
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,200
No, I'm done. I have it.

675
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,840
- You a man?
- Yes. 19.

676
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,440
- You alive?
- Yes. 18.

677
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,000
- Evel Knievel.
- Shit!

678
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,800
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

679
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,520
- Your hand's in my face.
- It's not.

680
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,520
- Am I touching you?
- Your hand's in my face.

681
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,440
- Move.
- I didn't touch you.

682
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,600
- You just touched me.
- You made me touch you.

683
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,360
This is your side.
This is your side.

684
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,040
Get off. Get off.

685
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,080
I'm gonna need a score
of car batteries...

686
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,960
Where's Linus?
Where's Linus?!

687
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,520
- There he is.
- Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

688
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,000
Should someone help him?

689
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,680
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

690
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,960
Back it up.

691
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,800
Let him in.

692
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,280
You stupid bastard!

693
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,160
- I say stay, you stay.
- Got it.

694
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,480
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

695
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,520
I got it.

696
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,320
Where are they?

697
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,880
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

698
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:19,280
- They will be here.
- "They will be here." Schmuck!

699
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,520
<i>You boys have a nice trip?</i>

700
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,920
We have a problem.

701
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,960
You've been red-flagged.

702
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,840
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

703
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,480
Like hawks.
Hawks with video cameras.

704
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,440
That's a problem.

705
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,280
- Saul, turn that off.
- When I'm ready...

706
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:01,280
- Saul!
- It's off! It's off!

707
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,760
Any idea how this happened?

708
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,040
- No.
- Oh, come on.

709
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,840
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

710
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,040
- I tailed you.
- Who told you to?

711
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,240
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

712
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,680
- Tess?
- My wife.

713
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,360
- Ex-wife.
- Tess is here?

714
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,760
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

715
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,920
- You're out, Danny.
- He's out?

716
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,600
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

717
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,760
- It's not your call.
- You put her before us and made it mine.

718
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,960
This is my job.

719
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,120
Not anymore.

720
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,680
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

721
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,120
Kid, you up for it?

722
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,600
I can do it.

723
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,280
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

724
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,080
Curtain goes up at 7.

725
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:05,240
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

726
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,920
Yes. No.

727
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,320
Very much no.

728
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,440
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

729
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,880
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

730
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,400
Hi.

731
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,560
What were you thinking about?

732
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,040
You.

733
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,680
<i>Where you gonna put your hands?</i>

734
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,600
No good.

735
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,160
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

736
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,720
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

737
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,720
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

738
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,600
Don't use seven words if four will do.

739
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,960
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

740
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,800
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

741
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,000
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't...

742
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,360
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

743
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,440
Sure.

744
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,720
Saul?

745
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,120
It's time.

746
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,840
Okay.

747
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,000
Let's do it.

748
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,320
<i>On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...</i>

749
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,400
<i>... with the expected crowd
of celebrities and sports fans...</i>

750
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,360
<i>... piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...</i>

751
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:22,800
<i>... prepare to meet after an eight-month
dance toward each other.</i>

752
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,280
Mr. Zerga?

753
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,120
Mr. Benedict.

754
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,680
- I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
- I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

755
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:38,040
<i>My courier should be here momentarily.</i>

756
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,360
Eighteen.
Blackjack!

757
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:18,440
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

758
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,840
I can't have private security
personnel in the casino cages.

759
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,560
Of course not.

760
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,680
Saul!
Saul Bloom, is that you?

761
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,000
Saul! Saul, it's me!
Bucky Buchanan!

762
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,960
Remember?
From Saratoga!

763
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,800
Mikael. Vladimir.

764
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,960
Hey! Hey, Saul!

765
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,880
Mr. Benedict, please.

766
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:52,760
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

767
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,440
Lift them up, please.

768
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,640
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

769
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,560
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

770
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,880
...for a period of 24 hours.

771
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,320
- I cannot allow you into the vault.
- Why not?

772
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:28,920
Insurance, for one. Security.
Most of all, I just don't trust you.

773
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,720
Excuse me.

774
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,720
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

775
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,600
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

776
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:47,000
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

777
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,080
Those are my terms.
Yes or no?

778
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:55,040
You leave me no choice.

779
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,080
Dude, don't do that
in front of the pinch.

780
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,520
<i>Deep breaths.
You'll do fine.</i>

781
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,160
<i>- Thank you.
- No sweat. You're a natural.</i>

782
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,000
<i>But don't screw up.</i>

783
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,680
- Who gets the penne?
- Right here.

784
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,600
You ready?

785
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,640
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

786
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,440
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

787
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,120
Don't let me keep you.

788
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,560
- Mr. Zerga.
- Mr. Benedict.

789
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,520
Linus, you're up.

790
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,000
Got him.

791
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,160
Mr. Benedict.

792
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,160
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

793
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,800
I need two minutes of your time.

794
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,920
- Anything for the NGC.
- Thanks.

795
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,360
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

796
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,760
<i>- You make the deposit when?
- At your signal.</i>

797
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,960
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

798
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,280
How does that feel?
You all right?

799
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,160
Want something to read?
A magazine?

800
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
All right.
Counting down.

801
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,240
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

802
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,960
This just came to our attention today.

803
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,880
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my...

804
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,120
It's long.

805
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:38,040
If he is who you say he is.

806
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,040
You been at the commission long?

807
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:49,640
- About 18 months.
- You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

808
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,880
Not since he died last year.

809
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,520
Ramón Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

810
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,240
What's going on here?

811
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,240
- It's come to our attention...
- We should speak off the floor.

812
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,920
Charlie.

813
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,240
Thank you.

814
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,560
- No. I want you out of here.
- Give me one moment.

815
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,160
- I've had it. I want you gone.
- Tess, come here.

816
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,000
You're up to something.

817
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:46,160
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

818
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,640
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

819
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,880
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

820
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,520
Goodbye.

821
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,760
You be good.

822
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,280
- Mr. Ocean.
- Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

823
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,680
I thought he might.

824
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,920
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.

825
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,400
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

826
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,200
You're Frank Catton,
of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn...

827
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:48,000
...and the New York state
penitentiary system. Are you not?

828
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,400
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

829
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,440
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know...

830
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,240
Goddamn cracker.

831
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,200
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

832
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,160
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

833
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,680
- You wanna throw me on the street.
- I'm doing my job.

834
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,440
Want me to get on the table and dance?
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

835
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:22,240
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it whitejack!

836
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,880
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

837
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:32,920
- Yeah, right.
- What a horrible thing to say!

838
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:38,840
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored...

839
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:43,280
- No! I didn't mean it!
- Okay. Come on, sit down.

840
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,080
- Sit down.
- You better talk to him.

841
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,560
<i>- He's got it.
- Sit down.</i>

842
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,920
Virgil. Turk.
Deliver the package.

843
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,000
- Where's your card?
- I lost it.

844
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,920
- You serious?
- I'm so stupid.

845
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,760
- You are so stupid! You know that?
- Hey!

846
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,640
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

847
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,360
- Hey! Keep it down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

848
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,080
- Where did this come from?
- High roller's room.

849
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,720
- It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
- Joe, take this inside.

850
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,520
- Count room?
- No, to the vault.

851
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,040
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

852
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,640
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

853
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,360
- Stupid.
- Jeez!

854
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,800
<i>Yo! Hold that, please.</i>

855
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,320
- There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
- Wonderful.

856
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,840
That's my cue.

857
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,680
Give Basher the go.

858
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,440
Bash, what's your status?

859
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,040
<i>- Bash!
- Easy. No need to shout, guv'nor.</i>

860
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,960
<i>- What's your status?
- I'm nearly there.</i>

861
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,880
Come on, come on.

862
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,080
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

863
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,040
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

864
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,440
Sir?

865
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,160
- Cracker!
- Oh, dear God!

866
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:57,480
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

867
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,960
- Know the way back?
- I do.

868
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,640
Good.

869
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,560
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

870
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,800
Sorry!

871
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,600
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

872
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,360
No cameras in this room, huh?

873
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,160
Yeah.

874
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,000
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

875
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,680
He's not coming, is he?

876
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,560
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you to talk things over.

877
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,760
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

878
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,720
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

879
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,600
That went well, but then
I went to this party...

880
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,280
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 11 a.m. ...

881
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,160
...so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

882
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,040
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice."

883
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,360
Oh, shit.

884
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,080
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

885
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:33,280
I am very satisfied.

886
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:40,600
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

887
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,840
All right.

888
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,360
Jesus!

889
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,960
Bruiser!

890
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,400
- Not until later!
- Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

891
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,640
It's all right.

892
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,600
- How's your wife?
- Pregnant again.

893
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,400
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

894
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,280
- You're almost there, Linus.
- Who's that guy?

895
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,880
- I got a bogey in west corridor.
- Mr. Zerga!

896
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,880
- Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
- Put this under his head.

897
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,920
Going to video now.

898
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,320
- To the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

899
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,560
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

900
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,280
Oh, Jesus!

901
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,760
- Did you really think I'd sit this out?
- You didn't trust me?

902
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,880
I do now.

903
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,000
Come on.

904
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,600
Someone call for a doctor?

905
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,520
- How'd you get here?
- Had to give a friend two million.

906
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:06,800
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

907
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,120
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

908
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,920
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

909
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,000
Come on, man! Breathe!

910
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:22,040
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

911
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:31,480
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

912
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,960
- Dude, I told you to hurry.
- Don't do that. Just don't.

913
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,640
I didn't tell you to hurry?

914
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,080
Come on, get up! Get up!

915
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,000
Had enough yet?

916
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:17,560
- These things will hold us, right?
- They should.

917
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,600
Livingston, we're set.

918
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,280
- Livingston, we're set.
- Basher, we're set.

919
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,600
Hang on a minute, chief.

920
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,400
<i>We don't have one.
Yen's gonna suffocate.</i>

921
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:48,600
Well, then you better leave off
bothering me, don't you think?

922
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,520
All right, crack them.

923
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,560
Go.

924
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,520
Shit!

925
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,520
Cut it.

926
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,680
Hey!

927
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,920
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

928
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:39,000
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

929
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,680
Get your coat.
Get your coat.

930
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,560
Look, this is crazy!
What...?

931
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,800
Not yet.
Not yet.

932
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,440
Go ahead.

933
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,920
- You think Yen made it out okay?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

934
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,280
How we doing?

935
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,680
Okay, I guess.

936
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,840
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $160 million behind this door.

937
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,720
- Let's get him out.
- Yeah.

938
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,600
- 10 cents he shorts it.
- No bet.

939
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,960
Try him again.

940
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,720
Okay.

941
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,320
Hey.
Where we at, boys?

942
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:18,920
- Pins and floor sensors, now.
- Blinding.

943
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,920
Here we go.

944
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,560
Counting down from 20.
Now.

945
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,600
Twenty.

946
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,800
- Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
- Ten...

947
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,840
...nine, eight...

948
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:52,640
- Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
- Do not blow the door!

949
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,320
...two, one.

950
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,840
What's wrong?

951
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,000
Something...

952
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,520
Did you check the batteries?

953
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,280
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second...

954
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,080
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

955
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,280
Yen?

956
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:03,000
Where the fuck you been?

957
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,240
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

958
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:21,080
That is the sexiest thing
I have ever seen.

959
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,560
Rusty, you're up.

960
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:40,120
- You gonna answer that?
- I don't have a cell phone.

961
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,640
This isn't mine.

962
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,880
See who it is.

963
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,160
<i>- Hello?
- May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?</i>

964
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,360
It's for you.

965
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:03,240
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- The man who's robbing you.</i>

966
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:11,560
- What's going on in the vault?
- Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

967
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,720
Show me.

968
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:18,080
<i>- You're mistaken.
- Watching your monitors?</i>

969
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,040
<i>Okay, keep watching.</i>

970
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,840
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

971
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:37,840
- Find out how much money's down there.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,320
Tess?

973
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,720
Tess?

974
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,720
Perhaps you should...

975
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,400
Perhaps I should what?

976
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:06,840
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

977
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,560
All right, you proved your point.

978
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,680
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

979
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:25,600
<i>- Maybe.
- Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?</i>

980
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,440
<i>You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?</i>

981
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,640
<i>- No. You'll carry it out for us.
- Why would I do that?</i>

982
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,920
Look at your monitor.

983
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,520
<i>As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $160 million...</i>

984
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,680
<i>... in your vault tonight.
We're only packing up half that.</i>

985
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,000
<i>The other half we're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.</i>

986
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:54,240
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

987
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:59,440
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

988
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:07,280
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $160 million publicly.

989
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,280
Your decision.
Hi.

990
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,680
Make the call.

991
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,080
<i>911 emergency response.</i>

992
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,200
- Where's Danny?
- He's fine. He's in good form.

993
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,320
- He asks that you go up and watch TV.
- He does?

994
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:42,640
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

995
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,960
- Okay.
- It's okay.

996
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,760
<i>- You have a deal.
- I promise.</i>

997
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,720
Fantastic.
Here's what you do:

998
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,600
<i>The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.</i>

999
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,640
<i>It will rise to your cages.</i>

1000
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:02,000
<i>Three of your guards will carry
the bags into the casino.</i>

1001
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:07,520
If they take more than 20 seconds
to reach the floor, or there's a switch...

1002
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,680
...we'll blow all the money.

1003
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,120
<i>- He's in the casino by the slots.
- Of course I am.</i>

1004
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:22,040
<i>I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: Mini bar.</i>

1005
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,680
<i>Once the guards
hit the casino floor...</i>

1006
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:30,080
<i>... a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.</i>

1007
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:36,520
<i>If anyone so much as approaches
the driver's door, we'll blow everything.</i>

1008
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,280
<i>When I hear the van is away and
the money is secure, my men will leave.</i>

1009
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,280
<i>Once their safety is confirmed,
you get your vault.</i>

1010
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,840
The S.W.A.T. team is here.

1011
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,400
All right.

1012
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,600
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1013
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,280
<i>I would.</i>

1014
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,840
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1015
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,680
Run and hide, asshole.
Run and hide.

1016
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:09,720
If you're picked up buying a $100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

1017
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:15,000
...I'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

1018
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,840
...rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1019
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:24,080
So, my advice to you again
is this: Run and hide.

1020
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:28,080
That is all that I ask.

1021
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:52,440
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1022
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:57,600
I want my vault back
before that van hits the tarmac.

1023
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:10,040
<i>Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.</i>

1024
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,640
Ready.

1025
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,120
Cutting power now.

1026
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,520
Do it.

1027
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,320
<i>Breaching elevator doors now.</i>

1028
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:29,160
<i>We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.</i>

1029
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,560
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1030
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,560
<i>Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!</i>

1031
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,680
<i>- Take him down, now!
- I got him!</i>

1032
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,320
<i>- Lights! We need power now!
- Give it to him.</i>

1033
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,760
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1034
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,960
<i>It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.</i>

1035
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,720
<i>Continuing search for survivors.</i>

1036
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,680
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1037
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,840
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1038
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,040
Yes, sir.

1039
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:30,800
Get out of the van, now.
Now!

1040
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,800
Tires. Tires.

1041
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,520
Our search yielded no suspects.

1042
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:59,320
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1043
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,880
- Take your men out.
- May I suggest...?

1044
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,680
Now.

1045
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,360
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1046
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,760
Walsh, where are
we with the van?

1047
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,600
I just want to try
something for a second.

1048
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,560
There's nobody inside.

1049
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:48,400
- I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
- Enough monkey business.

1050
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,680
Do it already.

1051
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,920
<i>Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.</i>

1052
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,120
<i>And?</i>

1053
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,560
<i>They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.</i>

1054
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,240
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1055
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:20,520
<i>They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.</i>

1056
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,280
Walsh?

1057
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,760
Cue the tape to the robbery.

1058
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,680
Yes, sir.
I'm looking at the tape now.

1059
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,280
<i>Does it say "Bellagio"
on the vault floor?</i>

1060
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,520
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1061
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,120
We had it installed Tuesday.

1062
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,920
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1063
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,840
<i>What?</i>

1064
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,960
It was staged. Somebody made
a duplicate of my vault.

1065
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:59,960
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1066
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:05,400
<i>I don't understand.
What happened to all that money?</i>

1067
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,760
Make the call.

1068
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,040
911 emergency response.

1069
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,160
- Night goggles on.
- Clear.

1070
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,320
Prepare to cut power.

1071
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,320
Breaching elevator doors now.

1072
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,600
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1073
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,920
Wait a minute.

1074
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,920
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1075
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:50,280
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1076
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,040
Open the door.

1077
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:47,920
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1078
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,440
Pick him up.

1079
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,640
Did you have a hand in this?

1080
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,600
Did I have my hand in what?

1081
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:13,520
I'll ask you one more time.

1082
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,400
Did you have a hand in this?

1083
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:24,000
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1084
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,120
Okay.

1085
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,640
You're free to go.

1086
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:36,320
Show him out.

1087
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,720
<i>- Hello.
- Turn to channel 88.</i>

1088
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,120
Who is this?

1089
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,840
<i>What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?</i>

1090
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:00,000
<i>Stop.</i>

1091
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,240
<i>I'll give you one last chance.</i>

1092
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,640
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1093
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,520
<i>What if I said you could
get your money back...</i>

1094
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,000
<i>... if you give up Tess?</i>

1095
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,600
<i>What would you say?</i>

1096
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,640
<i>I would say yes.</i>

1097
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,720
<i>All right.</i>

1098
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:37,040
<i>I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.</i>

1099
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,720
<i>Anybody pulls a job in the Western
U.S., he knows about it.</i>

1100
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:47,280
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1101
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:53,400
You know a guy.

1102
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:59,200
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1103
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,360
Yes, sir.

1104
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:28,600
Tess.

1105
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,800
Tess.

1106
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,440
You of all people
should know, Terry.

1107
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:38,840
In your hotel, there's
always someone watching.

1108
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,720
Wait!

1109
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,400
Wait!

1110
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:23,000
Wait, that's my husband!

1111
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,040
- Danny.
- Tess, I told you...

1112
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,800
...I knew what I was doing.

1113
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,440
I didn't.

1114
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,320
All right, let's go.

1115
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,240
How long will you be?

1116
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,360
About three to six months, I guess.

1117
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,600
I hope you were the groom.

1118
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:39,280
Ted Nugent called.
He wants his shirt back.

1119
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:49,280
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1120
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,240
I blew it all on the suit.

1121
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:55,520
- Where are they?
- Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1122
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,840
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1123
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,600
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1124
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

1125
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,440
Rusty needs a girl.

1126
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:21,880
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1127
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,880
You said that you sold this.

1128
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,720
I said that.

1129
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,840
Liar.

1130
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,800
Thief.
