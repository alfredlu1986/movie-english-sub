1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,461
Every night, the same dream.

2
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,213
The same strange planet.

3
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,005
But why?

4
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,215
What are they trying to tell me?

5
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,640
It's been 34 years since
they arrived on this planet.

6
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,391
And now the days passes,

7
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:52,310
the survivors forced
to live in barrier cities,

8
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,978
do not live in fear.

9
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:56,397
I have vowed to end that fear.

10
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:58,941
I believe my dreams hold the key.

11
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,442
The question is,

12
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:03,445
Will I be in time to save the Earth?

13
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,749
Where are you?

14
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,658
This is a restricted area.

15
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:09,076
Do not move!

16
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:10,536
What is she doing here, captain?

17
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,413
I don't know,
but we are getting her out.

18
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:14,205
You're coming with us.

19
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:15,956
Behind you!

20
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,084
Hold it right there!

21
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:19,918
Damn it!

22
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,545
Let's move, people.

23
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,551
Two, coming through the wall.

24
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,010
Alright, hold your fire.

25
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,558
Ryan, Neil, let's go.

26
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:44,522
Just what the hell do you think you are doing?

27
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:45,857
There is a life form in here.

28
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,399
There hasn't been life here in years.

29
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,400
Well, there is now.

30
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,208
Life form or not,I'm taking you in

31
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,905
Fine, arrest me, but I'm not leaving without that life form.

32
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,575
Gonna be one of those days.

33
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:17,175
Captain, principal is not going to
wait for us much longer.

34
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,384
I understand that.

35
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,361
It's in bad shape.

36
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:23,804
Please. Tell me when I risk my next
for this plant.

37
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,015
I won't even call it a plant.
It's wheat.

38
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,475
I won't even call it a wheat.

39
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:29,852
I need a minute to extract it.

40
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:32,103
Miss, that's the minute
we do not have.

41
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,897
I'm afraid he is right about that, ma'am.

42
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:37,983
Captain, we have incomings.

43
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,985
Captain, we need to get out from here.

44
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,153
Understood, sergeant.

45
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,487
Could you hurry please, miss?

46
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,362
Done, captain.

47
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:43,988
Yes, Neil.

48
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:46,491
Just all you know, I agree with.
Let's get out from here.

49
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,412
Can I have this please?
Thank you.

50
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:01,337
We're surrounded.

51
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:02,379
No! Shit!

52
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,423
Alright, everybody.
Just relax.

53
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,092
Captain, we got to get to higher
ground.

54
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:09,510
Everyone, up to top.

55
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,514
Go! Go! Go!

56
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,643
Transport requesting immediately evac.

57
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:20,811
Confirmative.

58
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:23,230
Up here!

59
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:30,443
Captain!

60
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,486
We are right behind you.

61
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,742
I got you.

62
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:41,620
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

63
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,247
Alright, everybody. Here they come.

64
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,572
Are you okay?

65
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:30,244
Can you give me one good reason
why I shouldn't arrest you?

66
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:31,787
I am Dr. Aki Ross.

67
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:33,247
I have clearance to be here.

68
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,415
Not unlimited clearance.
And not without authorization.

69
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:36,708
Captain, I don't have time for this.

70
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,877
Do you realize you've just risk
the lives at my squad and me?

71
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:41,420
Look.
I don't want to talk about it.

72
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,339
The fact of the matter is,
it was worth the lives of you and your men.

73
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,758
You and your men?

74
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:46,759
She thinks you are a man.

75
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,759
I think she's an idiot.

76
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,718
I know you are not a man.

77
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:49,761
I think you're an idiot too.

78
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,387
Very funny.

79
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:52,846
But I do want to talk about it.

80
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:56,600
Did it ever occur to you that maybe we
would volunteer to risk our lives?

81
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,434
Have we been given a choice?

82
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,603
Nobody asked you to save me.

83
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,172
I don't believe this.
You have not changed a bit.

84
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,316
Gray?

85
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:16,992
Yeah, nice to see you too.

86
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:14,498
Welcome back, captain.

87
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,791
We're cleaned.

88
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,125
Let's make sure of this, shall we?

89
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,876
I hate getting scanned.

90
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:22,005
Sir, this scan is probably worse
for us than the phantoms.

91
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,548
I'll probably about it, captain.

92
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:25,591
These machines are suspected
of causing sterility.

93
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:28,510
And I want to have a little new
junior calling me daddy someday.

94
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,011
That's a spooky thought.

95
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,887
Why are you always busting my chop?

96
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,681
People, let's just do this thing.
Alright.

97
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:36,434
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,029
Okay, next.

99
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,281
Looks like you gain some weight.

100
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,700
It's called body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.

101
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,285
I'm working on it.

102
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:01,705
You know my security rating allows
me to bypass this.

103
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,831
Not today, it doesn't.

104
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,125
Something's not right.

105
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:07,876
About this mission?

106
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:10,211
- Or that woman?
- Both.

107
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,921
Next.

108
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,255
Listen, captain. I think...

109
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:15,674
I don't care what you think, doctor.

110
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,843
You're getting scanned
just like everybody else.

111
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:26,975
Oh shit!

112
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:27,809
Captain!

113
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,643
They got him.

114
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:29,603
There must be a mistake.

115
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,897
You came in contact with the
phantom, sir.

116
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,273
Please remain calm.

117
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,981
Administering treatment shield.

118
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,232
What level is he?

119
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:36,775
Blue.

120
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,942
He will be code red in 3 1/2 minutes.

121
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:42,364
We have to treat him now.

122
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,990
I'm sorry.
That's impossible.

123
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,408
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.

124
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:46,867
There's no time for that.

125
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:52,664
Take him to the table.

126
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,291
Hang in there, captain.

127
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:10,845
Locating pathogens.

128
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,894
Jesus! Look at that thing.

129
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,270
How much more time?

130
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,146
Not enough.

131
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:22,981
When he reaches code red,

132
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:25,525
the treatment shield won't be
able to hold the aliens particles

133
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,735
Engaging bio-etheric laser.

134
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,961
- What's going on?
- Where does it go?

135
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:49,920
What the hell is going on?

136
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,963
We lost contact.

137
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,965
infestation is moving deeper.

138
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:55,382
- Tracking.
- There is no time.

139
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:57,843
- Tracking.
- There is no time!

140
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,302
You're gonna lose him.

141
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,932
Found it.

142
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,888
It's alright.

143
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,768
Don't worry.
You'll be back to normal in no time.

144
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,064
Doctor, we need to scan you
for infestation.

145
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,522
That won't be necessary.

146
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,775
I'll take responsibility.

147
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,198
Hey, Doc. Thanks for saving him.

148
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:16,700
Are you alright?

149
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,069
Yeah, but the military has
impounded my ship

150
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,371
What's with her?

151
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,122
What's with her and the captain?

152
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:24,082
What's with her and that stupid plant?

153
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:28,294
What?

154
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:37,635
Forward me the phantom data and everything
we got in the file spirits collected so far.

155
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:38,844
Yes, Doctor.

156
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:42,514
Spirits? I thought we weren't
supposed to use the S word.

157
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,933
Don't get smart with me.

158
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,019
Let's see if that plant does the trick.

159
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,446
It's a match.

160
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,656
We've found it.

161
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:05,409
Yes, the 6th spirit.

162
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:08,745
A little scene today brought
me every protocol

163
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:11,579
How long do you think this would
have survive outside the barrier?

164
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:15,083
Aki, you know there are elements in
the Council military just waiting

165
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,751
for an excuse to shut us down.

166
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:20,588
Look. 20 years ago, who discovered
this energy in the phantoms?

167
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:21,839
You.

168
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,301
And who proved the same energy source
existed in humans and every life form?

169
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:27,760
You.

170
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,681
You made the possible to harness that energy
for overpacks, scanners, even the barrier.

171
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:34,516
The Council knows that.

172
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,935
They trust you, Doctor.
We are so close to proving...

173
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:40,271
We still need this part and this one
here.

174
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:43,274
Exactly. Two more pieces
and we've solved the puzzle.

175
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:45,608
We need to be free to find those pieces.

176
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,902
I want to show you something, Aki.

177
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,614
- What is this?
- Read.

178
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,575
All life is born of Gaia and each
life has a spirit.

179
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:59,120
Each new spirit is housed in
a physical body. Doctor...

180
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,122
Go on.

181
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:04,291
Through their experiences on Earth,
each spirit matures and grows.

182
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,292
When the physical body dies,

183
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:13,174
the mature spirit enriched by it's life
on Earth returns to Gaia.

184
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:18,510
Bring in with it the experiences,
enabling Gaia to live and grow.

185
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:19,637
It's my old diary.

186
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:24,391
I wrote that 43 years ago when I
was the age you are now.

187
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:27,977
Dr. Sid!

188
00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:30,521
I know what happen to Galileo.

189
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,939
They threw him in jail because he said

190
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:34,024
the Earth was not
the center of the universe.

191
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,944
That could happen to us.

192
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:40,154
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.

193
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:41,906
If you have any notes or records,

194
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:43,616
it could
be used against you.

195
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,952
Destroy them.
Keep them up here.

196
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,578
Right.

197
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:51,413
And stay away from your friend,
the captain.

198
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,499
He saved your life,
you saved his life,

199
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,501
This leads to that.

200
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,252
I was young once too,
you know.

201
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:59,212
Doctor,
there is a war going on.

202
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,589
No one is young anymore.

203
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,330
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Council,
Could you please explain why? 

204
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,690
Zeus was completed a month ago.

205
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,317
If we attack the meteor with this,

206
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:17,236
we will eliminate the phantoms
at their source.

207
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,446
General Hein,
calm down.

208
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,280
At our last meeting,

209
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,531
we voted 6 to 2 to postpone
using the Zeus cannon

210
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,366
to attack the alien meteor.

211
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,070
We have reconvince today to vote
on that very issue again.

212
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:32,873
Now, I'd like to ask the director
of the bio-ethereal center to speak.

213
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:34,583
Dr Sid, please.

214
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:37,628
As you all know,

215
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:42,090
the phantom's nested in the alien meteor
that landed here 34 years ago.

216
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,925
What you see now,

217
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:47,010
are the records of every assault
on the meteor to date.

218
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,598
Physical attacks have had utterly no effect.

219
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:55,434
This seems to place 3 months ago
during a full scale bombard.

220
00:21:55,434 --> 00:22:00,229
And please note that the phantoms outside
the meteor are indeed destroyed.

221
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:04,025
However inside, many that ??? come to live.

222
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:08,612
And as you see over all phantom
density remains the same.

223
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:11,865
The newly recent aliens respond
to the attack.

224
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,909
By bury, even deeper into the Earth.

225
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,285
Now this is very interesting to me, Dr. Sid.

226
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:21,081
Because we see the same thing during surgery.

227
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:24,417
When using bio-etheric lasers
on phantom particles.

228
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,877
- Do we not?
- Yes, indeed we do.

229
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:29,879
You see the injured particles escape,

230
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:33,633
burying or digging themselves
deeper into the patient's body.

231
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:37,762
And when we increase the laser power
to destroy these deeper particles,

232
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:43,140
we have had incidents resulting and
further injury to a patient.

233
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,102
And in some cases, death.

234
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,688
And what exactly does that mean, Doctor?

235
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:51,314
It means there is a very good chance the

236
00:22:51,314 --> 00:22:54,775
beam from the Zeus cannon will burn
the phantoms in the meteor.

237
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:55,985
Exactly. Thank you.

238
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:56,652
However,

239
00:22:56,652 --> 00:23:02,824
it also means that the beam energy
may be too strong injuring the Earth.

240
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:10,789
Injure the Earth? You mean the Gaia, 
You mean the spirit of the Earth?

241
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:15,876
Yes. The spirit of the Earth.

242
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:18,504
???I need to see whatever it is said.???

243
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:21,214
What are you doing?
-I know what I'm doing

244
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:23,049
and whatever you do,
keep you mouth shut.

245
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:24,300
This is ridiculous.

246
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,176
Doctor, with all the respect.

247
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:29,763
Did you come here just to talk
about some Gaia theory?

248
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:32,683
To tell us the planet is alive?

249
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:35,767
That it has a spirit?
That's a fairy-tale, Doctor.

250
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,686
And I'm sorry, but we don't have time for that.

251
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:40,063
It's not a fairy-tale, it is true.

252
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:45,819
So, if I point a gun to the Earth and fire,

253
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:49,905
I'm not just making a hole on
the ground, I am killing the planet.

254
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,198
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory has
not been proven.

255
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,909
Even if Gaia does exist,

256
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:56,578
won't we still have to remove the
phantoms.

257
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:59,496
I think if there's any chance of
success,

258
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:00,623
we should take it?

259
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:02,916
- Don't you agree?
- Of course I do.

260
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,752
But there is an alternative to this
space cannon

261
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:06,753
Another method?

262
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,421
Yes, I mean of disabling the
phantoms.

263
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,881
Please.

264
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,384
As we know the aliens display
a distinct energy pattern

265
00:24:16,344 --> 00:24:21,556
Now it is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric
waves placed one over the other

266
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,225
will cancel each other out.

267
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:26,311
It's theoretically possible
to construct the wave pattern

268
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:28,896
in direct opposition to the phantom energy.

269
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,397
We are currently assembling...

270
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,054
- Doctor....
- such a wave in a nearing completion...

271
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,694
Members of the Council,
gathering plants and animals

272
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:40,949
from around the world to fight
the phantoms is other nonsense.

273
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:45,117
The Zeus cannon is a
proven effective weapon.

274
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:48,162
It will kill phantoms.

275
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,499
Can we afford to wait for some
crazy inventions

276
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:55,668
Some army of touchy feeling
plants and animals

277
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:59,171
An invention that offers no solid evidence
that will destroy the aliens.

278
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:00,631
There is evidence.

279
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:03,092
Our partially completed energy
wave has

280
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:05,261
successfully
stopped phantom particles

281
00:25:05,261 --> 00:25:07,929
from spreading through a
terminally infected patient.

282
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:11,682
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence
that terminal patient has been cured.

283
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:15,143
Not cured. The wave is not
completed.

284
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:19,939
But we have succeeded in containing
the particles safely inside the patient.

285
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,108
Where is the proof?

286
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,943
Here.

287
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,872
You may have bought us some time, Aki.

288
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,583
But I wonder at what cost?

289
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,378
Doctor, I can't keep hiding in the
background while you protect me.

290
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,797
I want what life I have left
to mean something.

291
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:53,133
You listen to me.
When we find the 7th and 8th spirits...

292
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:56,344
If we find them,
what we need now is some luck.

293
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:58,972
Luck has nothing to do with it.

294
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,765
Fate and hard work, girl.

295
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:05,059
Cause I'll be damned if you going to die before me.

296
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:36,461
The Council decided to postpone
firing the Zeus cannon.

297
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,130
I guess I put on a good show.

298
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,882
Mind if I take a look?

299
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:42,342
You'll probably get bored.

300
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:57,853
So what are you doing?

301
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:01,899
Oh, I see.

302
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:03,442
Giving me the silent treatment.

303
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:06,987
I am scanning the city for the 7th spirit.

304
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:20,706
Hurry up, Neil.

305
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,124
Relax serg, I almost got it.

306
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:23,334
What do you think you are doing?

307
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,126
We just gonna strengthen them for a while.

308
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:28,213
Hey, don't look at me.
It was his idea.

309
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,631
This was your idea?

310
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:31,715
We just help the captain up a little.

311
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:33,884
Come on, Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?

312
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:36,303
You see how the captain looks at her.

313
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,350
It's amore, baby.

314
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:45,394
What's going on?

315
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:47,354
It's probably just a glidge.

316
00:27:47,854 --> 00:27:51,732
- Listen, Aki...
- I'm still mad at you.

317
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:52,900
You are mad at me?

318
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,402
Leaving your helmet on and not
telling me who you were?

319
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:57,487
That doesn't seem a little childish.

320
00:27:57,487 --> 00:28:02,075
I was just a little upset when you just packed
and left for the Zeus station without saying a word.

321
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:04,244
Well, now you know what's going on,
alright?

322
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:05,243
Yeah, now I know.

323
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,912
My operation had to be done
in zero graph, okay?

324
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:09,163
Fine!

325
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:11,416
how about the fact that
I was sent there on the job

326
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,458
And you wouldn't even see me?

327
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,128
I was probably helping Dr. Sid
collect spirit wave.

328
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,004
Now I know.

329
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:16,962
So I'm sorry.

330
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,713
Well, me too.
So we are both sorry.

331
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,430
So would you tell me about them?

332
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,723
About what?

333
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:31,974
About the spirits you've collected.

334
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:36,437
I was infected by a phantom
during an experiment.

335
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:38,772
Normally no one could have survived.

336
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,106
How did you?

337
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,193
Dr. Sid created a membrane
around the infection

338
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:44,736
Keeping me alive.

339
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:47,196
So the first spirit wave was me.

340
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,031
The second was a fish.

341
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:50,073
A fish?

342
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:54,285
The third was a deer I found in a
wildlife-preserve outside Moscow.

343
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,704
The fourth was a bird.

344
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,748
Ever try to track a sparrow from outer space?

345
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:01,208
It's no fun.

346
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:03,125
What am I saying?
You probably would love that.

347
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,376
You are right. I probably would.

348
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,588
And then there was that plant
I collected from Time Square.

349
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:09,006
I thought that was number 6.

350
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,633
- What?
- You skipped one.

351
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:18,722
The fifth was a little girl dying in
a hospital emergency room.

352
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,893
I retrieved the sample in time,
but she...

353
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:27,020
I told her everything has a spirit.

354
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,191
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls,
even the earth.

355
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:36,195
I told her that she wasn't dying,
just returning to the Earth spirit.

356
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:37,905
The Gaia.

357
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:44,619
She... told me that she
was ready to die.

358
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:52,625
She said I didn't have to make up
stories to make her feel better.

359
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,839
Only 7 years old and ready to die.

360
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,257
I'm sorry.

361
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,887
I have work to do.
I have to find the 7th and the 8th spirits.

362
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,972
Don't... please....

363
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,683
You don't believe any of this, do you?

364
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,687
I just... don't know, Aki.

365
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:21,983
Is this why you shut me out?

366
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:23,651
You should have told me.

367
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:27,280
I don't know how much time I have left.

368
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:29,824
Who does?

369
00:30:35,828 --> 00:30:37,413
I better get back to scanning.

370
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:59,515
Captain Edwards, you extracted Dr. Ross
from old New York several days ago.

371
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:00,432
Did you not?

372
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:03,351
What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?

373
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:06,770
She seemed very capable and determined, Sir.

374
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:11,233
You and the Deep Eyes are being
temporary reassigned.

375
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:14,819
You will guard Dr. Ross when she
re-enters the waste land.

376
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:16,029
Understood, sir.

377
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:17,946
You don't understand yet, Captain.

378
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:23,160
Report any ebullient behavior in Dr.
Ross to the Major immediately.

379
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,745
Ebullient behavior, sir?

380
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:27,455
The woman carries an alien
infestation, captain.

381
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:30,248
We don't know what it maybe doing to her.

382
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:32,709
The aliens presence could be
effecting her judgement.

383
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:35,712
And maybe manipulating the Doctor
for their very own purposes

384
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:39,548
Is the General suggesting that
Dr Ross is a spy?

385
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:44,636
The General is wondering why he is
explaining himself to a captain.

386
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,680
She's had a long exposure
to phantom tissue

387
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,432
If this begins to manifest itself in
anyway,

388
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,726
Dr Ross is to be placed under arrest.

389
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:55,394
And transport here for observation.

390
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,525
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.

391
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:01,900
Of course, sir.

392
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,743
Major, send some of our man
to keep an eye on the good captain.

393
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:52,660
I'm convinced that these dreams are
some form of communication.

394
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,995
The message still eludes me.

395
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:56,704
But they are coming faster now.

396
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,748
And that can only mean one thing.

397
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,544
The phantoms inside me are
beginning to win

398
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:06,713
Our target is to ??? at two sign.

399
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:07,422
Roger.

400
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,257
Phantom concentration.
Not good.

401
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,050
We got big mammoths everywhere.

402
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,802
So it's gonna be a real picnic.

403
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,721
Stick close to me.
No heroics today, okay?

404
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,055
Everything by the book.

405
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,098
By the book, right.

406
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:28,731
If we drop energy baits here,
here and here,

407
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:31,067
we should be able to land, acquire the target

408
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,402
and get out before the
phantoms even know we were there.

409
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:35,238
And the baits will attract the phantoms.

410
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:37,656
Yeah, For a while.

411
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:48,958
So you are from the 307s, right?

412
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:52,709
Under General Hein?
Have you done any wasteland recon before?

413
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,795
And get pretty ugly.

414
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:26,488
Captain, rendezvous evac at
sector 6 code at 279.

415
00:35:26,488 --> 00:35:29,491
Roger that. Stay out for hard tiles.

416
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:49,924
Looks like they are taking the ????.

417
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,149
The 7th spirit should be just
beyond that line of wreckage.

418
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:12,651
I don't see how any living thing
could survive out here.

419
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,736
You'll find out soon enough.

420
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:19,575
This was the phantom cleansing mission.

421
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,993
It was supposed to end the war.

422
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,914
My father is in here somewhere.

423
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:33,503
Alright. Let's move out, people.

424
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:51,518
I'll be damn.

425
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,144
A survivor.

426
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,604
What is it doing out here?

427
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:58,023
Hoping for life to return.

428
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:03,445
- Is that our spirit, Doc?
- No.

429
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,207
We've closing in on a life form.

430
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,125
Distance?

431
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,251
Hard to say.

432
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:24,254
We are very close.

433
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:25,505
I don't see anything.

434
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:33,511
You're not gonna tell me it's him.

435
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,012
That's impossible

436
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,688
It's not the soldier. It's his overpack.

437
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:46,730
How do you explain that?

438
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,408
Packs? Power or weapon?
The barrier cities?

439
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:51,776
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.

440
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:53,945
And to create that energy,
we use living tissue.

441
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:55,280
Single cell organism.

442
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,449
You're telling me his backpack
is the 7th spirit.

443
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,867
Yes.

444
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:00,367
Captain, do you read me?

445
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,326
Once say again.

446
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:03,870
Captain, we have incoming.

447
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,205
Ryan, get the soldier's pack.

448
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:25,513
I need a hand, sergeant.

449
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,476
- Those baits....
- Yeah.

450
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:31,310
They are not working.

451
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,436
Thank you.

452
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,272
Are you alright?

453
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,565
Of course I am.

454
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,733
Let's get the hell out of here.

455
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:46,988
Something is not right.
It shouldn't be happening.

456
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:47,406
Something's attracting them.

457
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:50,326
Aki...

458
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,082
There are right on us, sir.
Closing in fast.

459
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:58,665
Jane, take the lead.

460
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,180
Fire the whole!

461
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,609
Get us out of here, Neil.

462
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,443
Sir, I would love to

463
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:33,320
but...
- Just do it!

464
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:59,676
- Sir?
- Ok, that's it.

465
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,303
That doesn't look good, captain.

466
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:05,179
We have to get her to a hospital.

467
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,473
You have your orders, sir.

468
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:09,475
What the hell is going on here?

469
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:12,270
Dr. Ross is to be taken
into the custody now, sir.

470
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:19,550
Lower your weapons.
That's an order.

471
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,061
Sir, We have no choice but to re-leave
you of your command.

472
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:23,279
I won't let you do this, soldier.

473
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:24,405
You gonna have to shoot me.

474
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:26,198
Bend down, captain!

475
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:27,624
Aki!

476
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,185
Hang on, everyone!

477
00:41:57,358 --> 00:41:58,441
That's enough!

478
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:00,485
Hands up, so I can see them,
everyone, down.

479
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,674
Neil, get us back to New York.

480
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:27,717
Fast.

481
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,352
The "Deep eyes" are returned
from the wasteland, sir.

482
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:44,002
Apparently there was an incident.

483
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,106
It would seem the phantoms
were attracted to Dr Ross.

484
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:48,108
The crew barely escaped
with their lives.

485
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,445
And sir... Captain Edward
is still in command.

486
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,779
Issue an order.

487
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,198
I want Edward and Dr. Ross
placed under arrest.

488
00:42:57,198 --> 00:43:00,410
All research materials pretending
to Dr Sid wave theory

489
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,829
are to be confiscated immediately.

490
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:04,997
That might not go over too well
with the Council, sir.

491
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:07,291
What a tragedy that would be.

492
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:10,168
This is perfect, Major.

493
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,587
The good captain
has opened the door for us.

494
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:15,840
By tomorrow morning,
the Council would bear our feet.

495
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,217
Thanking us for exposing the
traitors and ???? imploring us

496
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:21,636
to save them from the phantoms.

497
00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:28,016
How is she, Doctor?

498
00:43:29,017 --> 00:43:30,351
She is dying.

499
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:32,437
There must be something you can do.

500
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:35,106
Aki is fighting with only
6 of the 8 spirits.

501
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:38,025
We have to implant the 7th
directly into her chest plate.

502
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:39,442
It took a bullet.

503
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,235
I think it might be damaged.

504
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:43,571
We have to repair this panel quickly.

505
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:46,157
Her vital signs are dropping.

506
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,659
Aki is slipping away from us.

507
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:54,163
She needs a sympathetic spirit to
help hold her in this world.

508
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:57,875
And I can think of no spirit better
suited for that task than yours,

509
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,667
captain.

510
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:00,836
I don't understand.

511
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:02,337
You don't have to understand.

512
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:05,047
You just be with her now.

513
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,509
You'll keep her here with us.

514
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:03,471
Aki, where are we?

515
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:04,931
On an alien planet.

516
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:06,599
How is that possible?

517
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:10,811
I'm not entirely sure.

518
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,562
You seem pretty calm.

519
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:16,274
I have been having this dream
every night for months.

520
00:45:16,274 --> 00:45:17,358
Dream?

521
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:20,027
Well, whatever it is.

522
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:24,156
You're really here, aren't you?

523
00:45:25,614 --> 00:45:27,867
What's happening to me?

524
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:31,953
Dr Sid is implanting the 7th spirit
directly into your body.

525
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,582
Then you are my spiritual support.

526
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:39,209
Gray, how sweet of you.

527
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,962
Look, I don't think you realize how
serious this situation is.

528
00:45:46,632 --> 00:45:48,676
Something you should see here, sir.

529
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:59,352
And I am watching... what, major?

530
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:03,189
It seems Dr Ross has been
recording her dreams.

531
00:46:03,981 --> 00:46:08,317
And why would I be interested in...
her dreams?

532
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:10,903
This is it.
This is our evidence.

533
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:13,364
She's under the influence of the phantoms.

534
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:19,759
Dr Ross's dreams should be

535
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:22,996
all the Council needs to authorize
the firing of the Zeus cannon.

536
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:26,792
The Council is contempt to hide
powering inside this barrier

537
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,834
while the world dies a little more everyday.

538
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:32,171
I believe they need a push in
the right direction, major.

539
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:34,297
Get together a group of
your most trusted men.

540
00:47:27,216 --> 00:47:28,259
What are they doing?

541
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:29,385
Why are they staring at us?

542
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:31,387
Not at us.

543
00:48:21,595 --> 00:48:23,055
Welcome back, captain.

544
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:27,392
Is it over?

545
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:29,686
How is she, Doctor?

546
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:31,104
She is gonna be fine.

547
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:32,521
But this is only temporary.

548
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:35,565
We need to find the 8th and
final spirit to cure her.

549
00:48:39,235 --> 00:48:41,905
Aki, can you hear me?

550
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:45,949
I finished it.

551
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:50,870
I know what it means,
I know what the phantoms really are.

552
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:53,122
Nobody move!

553
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:55,916
You are all under arrest!

554
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:07,717
We have them, sir.

555
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:10,345
Sir?

556
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,931
My wife and daughter.

557
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:19,310
Were killed by phantoms in the San Francisco 
barrier when the city was attacked.

558
00:49:19,852 --> 00:49:21,980
Did I ever tell you that?

559
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:26,275
I try to imagine what...

560
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:29,610
???  ??? , seeing everyone
around you,

561
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,113
fall over dead with
no apparent reason.

562
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:35,116
And then at the end,

563
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:37,576
feeling something next to you.

564
00:49:38,202 --> 00:49:41,705
Invisible... touching you.

565
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,999
Reaching inside your body.

566
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:49,586
You've lost family, haven't you?

567
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,754
Yes, sir.

568
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:54,590
That's why I trust you.

569
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:56,341
All of you.

570
00:49:56,717 --> 00:49:59,261
You know what must be done.

571
00:50:14,106 --> 00:50:15,482
Major, arrest these men.

572
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:26,867
Reduce power to sector 31.

573
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,786
Sir, you do realize that the phantoms...

574
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:30,495
What I realize,

575
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:34,624
major is that we must force the Council
to take action against the enemy.

576
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,298
25% of energy ??? redirect.

577
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:48,385
Lowering power output to sector 31.

578
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:52,221
Barrier breach in sector 31, General.

579
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,056
They're coming through now.

580
00:50:53,056 --> 00:50:56,517
I think we can easily handle a few
phantoms in a contain space.

581
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:58,435
Relax, major.

582
00:50:58,644 --> 00:51:01,855
When this night is over,
you are going to be a hero.

583
00:51:04,649 --> 00:51:05,566
Aki, I don't think...

584
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:06,525
You were in my dream, Gray.

585
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:07,276
You saw it.

586
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,235
That's just it.

587
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,444
I'm not sure what I saw.

588
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:10,236
How can you be?

589
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:11,279
Captain, please.

590
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:12,405
Let her continue.

591
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,908
Why do you think,

592
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:17,409
we've never been able to
determine a relationship

593
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:18,786
between the human size phantoms

594
00:51:18,786 --> 00:51:21,204
and the giant one's roaming
away slants?

595
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,330
Excuse me, Doc.

596
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,749
But what ???? relationship?

597
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:29,879
I mean you got your human size phantoms
and your creepy caterpillary phantoms,

598
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:30,921
and your flying phantoms,

599
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,755
and let's not forget
my personal favorite -

600
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,423
the big fat giant phantoms...

601
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,300
- Down, boy.
- He's right.

602
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,427
If you spend as much time in
the field as we have,

603
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:40,888
you know there is no relationship.

604
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:43,097
It's like a zoo out there.
-Precisely,...
605
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:46,064
I think the giant ones are like our whales or elephants?
-But why will an invading army bring a bunch 
 
606
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:50,569
of whales or elephants along for the ride?
???That must be ship of some kind of a crazy known as ark.???

607
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:59,569
We always assume that the meteor was
intended as a form of transportation.

608
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:00,529
Perhaps it wasn't.

609
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:02,364
The meteor is a chunk of their planet.

610
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:04,949
They got thrown into space
when they destroyed their world.

611
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:09,745
But how could they survive the trip across
outer space on a hunk of rock?

612
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:11,121
They didn't.

613
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:17,584
This is all beginning to make
a creepy kind of sense.

614
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,670
What do you think about all this, captain?

615
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,590
I think that explains why we
never had a chance.

616
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,884
All our strategies are based
on one assumption,

617
00:52:27,384 --> 00:52:30,804
that we were fighting alien invaders.

618
00:52:31,054 --> 00:52:32,806
Think of the dream, Gray.

619
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:34,099
How they died?

620
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:36,476
Since then,
all they know is suffering.

621
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:39,102
They are not an invading army.

622
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:40,186
They are ghosts.

623
00:52:42,939 --> 00:52:44,065
How many phantoms?

624
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:46,276
More than enough to
convince the Council, sir.

625
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:49,820
Excellent. Sound an alert, send 
the squad out to eliminate them.

626
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,946
Yes, sir.

627
00:52:53,698 --> 00:52:55,366
Sir,
I have numerous phantom contacts.

628
00:52:55,366 --> 00:52:56,784
Well, of course you do.

629
00:52:56,784 --> 00:52:58,620
Outside the sector 31, sir.

630
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,413
And moving in incredible speed.

631
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:02,372
Major,
what the hell is going on here?

632
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:03,332
They are in the pipes.
They are moving with bio-etheric energy flow.

633
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:07,335
That's impossible.

634
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:10,379
No living thing could survive
in those pipes.

635
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:13,465
Well, we got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.

636
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:24,057
Oh my god...

637
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:26,142
Hold your fire!

638
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:13,848
What have I done?

639
00:54:34,866 --> 00:54:35,701
Come on, Neil.

640
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:37,035
We need to find a way out.

641
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:39,162
Now you are on man, think.

642
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:41,289
Captain, these wall are titanium alloy.

643
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:43,248
And the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.

644
00:54:43,248 --> 00:54:46,251
I mean is not like I can just wave
a magic wand and...

645
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:51,339
Well, Neil, I'm impressed.

646
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:52,674
That makes two of us.

647
00:54:52,674 --> 00:54:55,383
Proceed to the nearest evacuation
facility.

648
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:01,514
I think we should proceed to
the nearest evacuation facility.

649
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,226
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.

650
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:28,536
Here they come.

651
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:30,330
But the others... Dr. Sid!

652
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:32,415
Deep Eyes will take care of him.
Come on!

653
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:41,631
What's happening?

654
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:42,590
Why can we see them now?

655
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,259
Must be carrying residium charge
passing through the barrier.

656
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:51,513
Behind you!

657
00:56:54,317 --> 00:56:55,609
On the board, captain.

658
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,000
We need to find my ship.

659
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,586
If it was towed inside the city,
it could be in the military hangar.

660
00:58:07,586 --> 00:58:08,837
That's a big "If".

661
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:19,596
Look out!

662
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:28,979
- Get us out of the platform.
- You got it.

663
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,580
Okay, now what?

664
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:51,790
- We're going through the station.
- What?

665
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:54,542
- Captain, with all due respect...
- Excuse me, captain...

666
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:57,002
The station, we're going through it.

667
00:58:57,002 --> 00:58:59,338
It's the only way.

668
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:02,966
Shall I gather this will
be somewhat of a rough ride.

669
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:05,301
Doc, you've got a talent for
understatement.

670
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:08,638
Hang on, everybody.

671
00:59:32,324 --> 00:59:33,701
Doc?

672
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:38,870
Interesting.

673
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:40,539
Anybody hurt?

674
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:41,873
Captain!

675
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,254
Oh God! Talk to me, serg.
-Ouch!

676
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:52,465
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- No, wait!

677
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:54,309
We're risking further injury.

678
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:56,011
We need the proper tools
to cut him out.

679
00:59:56,044 --> 00:59:57,219
They are in my ship.

680
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,264
No! No, Doc.

681
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,348
No drugs.

682
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,392
- Captain...
- You heard the man.

683
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:06,144
We'll find the ship and
we'll be back for you.

684
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,979
- I'll stay with him.
- Me too.

685
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,646
Nobody's staying.

686
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:12,357
Just give me a gun.

687
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:14,192
You got it.
Give him a weapon.

688
01:00:14,192 --> 01:00:15,652
Do it!

689
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:20,113
We'll be back for you, sergeant.

690
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,448
You hear me?

691
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:25,285
I hear you, captain.
Now get out of here.

692
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:26,536
Let's move out.

693
01:01:18,246 --> 01:01:19,664
A quad ???.

694
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:20,748
This is good.

695
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:23,876
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and
transport him safely here.

696
01:01:23,876 --> 01:01:27,378
However we need to replace
this panel's fuel cell

697
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:30,923
There could be some live
overpacks in the hangar.

698
01:01:30,923 --> 01:01:32,466
Alright, Jane.
Check the hangar.

699
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:34,301
Neil, get us ready for take off.

700
01:01:34,301 --> 01:01:36,428
Aki and Dr. Sid prep the quad troll.

701
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:38,554
I'll go to the tower and rotate the air track.

702
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,640
The city maybe lost.
But we are not.

703
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,725
Let's do this thing and get
the hell out of here.

704
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:55,151
Gray...

705
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:56,570
Be careful.

706
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,529
You too.

707
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:41,566
Oh yeah.

708
01:02:57,138 --> 01:02:58,580
Neil, do you read me?

709
01:02:58,714 --> 01:03:00,122
Loud and clear, captain.

710
01:03:00,122 --> 01:03:02,182
This baby would fly itself.

711
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:11,466
Flight path is set.

712
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:12,592
Beginning rotation.

713
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:18,764
??? air track.
We have a problem.

714
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:21,516
I'm reading an impound
tracks is still attached ??? the ship.

715
01:03:21,516 --> 01:03:23,351
Can you disengage it
from the cockpit?

716
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:26,437
No, sir.
Permission to go outside and detach the ???.

717
01:03:26,437 --> 01:03:28,480
Do it!

718
01:03:40,698 --> 01:03:41,824
There is the problem.

719
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:52,918
The controls are locked naturally.

720
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:57,712
Jane, let me ask you something.

721
01:03:57,712 --> 01:03:59,589
You think we'll get out of here alive?

722
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:02,008
I mean I wonder if anybody else
is getting out

723
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:04,010
You think anyone's made it this far?

724
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,887
You think this 8th spirit stuff is really gonna
work against the phantoms?

725
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,139
I mean what if it is all a
bunch of mambo jumbo?

726
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:14,394
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?

727
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:16,228
I'm trying to concentrate here.

728
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:30,866
What's happening out there?

729
01:04:31,241 --> 01:04:32,409
Nothing we can't handle.

730
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,921
- What's your status?
- Almost there.

731
01:04:50,256 --> 01:04:51,382
I want you two back inside!
-We're fine, sir.

732
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:53,885
Jane is negotiating with
extreme ??? .

733
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:55,344
Talk to me, Jane.

734
01:04:57,471 --> 01:04:59,390
No problem here, Captain.

735
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:07,438
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

736
01:05:30,081 --> 01:05:31,750
No!

737
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:51,725
Jane, get out of there.
Get out now! Go!

738
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,478
Get the hell out of there!

739
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,896
Jane!

740
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:24,460
The shield is powered and ready.

741
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:26,045
Where are you going?

742
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:26,629
To the cockpit.

743
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:28,214
The ship is set on autopilot

744
01:06:28,214 --> 01:06:30,299
We are in countdown to lift off.

745
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:31,049
Wait.

746
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:32,175
It's too dangerous.

747
01:06:32,175 --> 01:06:33,510
Aki!

748
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,448
Over here. You son of a bitch.

749
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:14,511
Ryan!

750
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:29,148
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?

751
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:31,609
You and Sid are getting out of here now.

752
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:33,444
No! We can't just leave everyone.

753
01:08:33,444 --> 01:08:35,111
Everyone's dead.
-I'm not leaving without you.

754
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:39,073
I'm sorry.
But you don't have a choice.

755
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,034
Goodbye, Aki.

756
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:33,553
I just... I wish I could believe
they are in a better place.

757
01:13:43,203 --> 01:13:46,039
I enlarge the scanning perimeter to include 
an area that we had previously overlooked.

758
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:50,166
The impact crater.

759
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:53,086
That's a strange place
to find the 8th spirit.

760
01:13:53,378 --> 01:13:54,671
Yes, really, quite astonishing.

761
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:57,215
But nothing could survive in there
except phantoms.

762
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:58,925
Precisely.

763
01:13:58,925 --> 01:14:02,093
We have suggested that the 8th
spirit is a phantom spirit.

764
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,053
I can't explain it at the moment,

765
01:14:04,053 --> 01:14:06,056
but once we get down there...
- Wait!

766
01:14:06,056 --> 01:14:07,682
- You'll understand...
- Doctor...

767
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:09,308
That's the one way trip.

768
01:14:09,308 --> 01:14:12,519
Yes. Yes, I expected that's how
you'll valuate our chances.

769
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:15,105
What, am I wrong?
No no no, I agree.

770
01:14:15,105 --> 01:14:16,981
We'll probably won't
live long enough

771
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:19,233
to extract the 8th spirit
from the crater...

772
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:20,776
Then why should we even try it?

773
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:23,195
Because we don't need to
extract the 8th spirit.

774
01:14:23,195 --> 01:14:25,071
If we can't bring the final spirit here,

775
01:14:25,071 --> 01:14:28,116
we can go there and complete
the wave inside the crater.

776
01:14:28,116 --> 01:14:29,450
Yes. Exactly.

777
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:31,702
And how do we do that... exactly?

778
01:14:31,702 --> 01:14:33,328
I can construct the device

779
01:14:33,328 --> 01:14:37,707
that would attach to Aki's chest plate
together the eight spirits and then...

780
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,626
-And then what?

781
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,711
...and then we wait

782
01:14:42,919 --> 01:14:44,337
and see what happens.

783
01:14:44,838 --> 01:14:45,921
That's it?

784
01:14:46,922 --> 01:14:48,591
That's your plan?
We wait and see what happens?

785
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:49,675
Yes.

786
01:14:51,302 --> 01:14:52,720
Oh good.

787
01:14:52,928 --> 01:14:54,430
But I got my own plan.

788
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,347
We keep scanning the surface from orbit

789
01:14:56,347 --> 01:14:58,557
and maybe we'll find a compatible
spirit somewhere else.

790
01:14:59,057 --> 01:15:01,059
Aki?

791
01:15:01,059 --> 01:15:02,811
I say we go in.

792
01:15:07,149 --> 01:15:10,942
General Hein, you're clear for
docking to zero one alpha.

793
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,588
What caused the barrier to fail,
General Hein?

794
01:15:34,588 --> 01:15:38,424
I'm afraid it was only a matter of time

795
01:15:38,424 --> 01:15:41,385
before the phantoms develop
an immunity to our barriers.

796
01:15:41,385 --> 01:15:44,846
But I'm ??? to see you
and the rest of the Council

797
01:15:44,846 --> 01:15:48,558
were able to evacuate to Houston
without incident.

798
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,102
It was a terrible loss suffer this evening.

799
01:15:51,811 --> 01:15:54,854
The Council had reconsidered your
proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.

800
01:15:54,979 --> 01:15:56,189
I see.

801
01:15:56,189 --> 01:15:58,650
We are transmitting the
access codes to you now.

802
01:16:00,819 --> 01:16:05,479
And General,
best of luck to us all.

803
01:16:08,783 --> 01:16:09,909
Prepare to fire the cannon.

804
01:16:09,909 --> 01:16:11,577
The target, sir?

805
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:14,705
The phantom crater.

806
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:45,647
Prepare to drop in three, two, one.

807
01:16:51,277 --> 01:16:52,528
Powering the shield.

808
01:16:55,906 --> 01:16:57,700
Okay, we are __?__?__ .

809
01:16:57,766 --> 01:16:59,284
Do you have it inside, Doctor?

810
01:16:59,284 --> 01:17:02,202
There are so many of them!

811
01:17:04,697 --> 01:17:06,657
Wait. Yes.

812
01:17:06,657 --> 01:17:10,127
I'm tracking the 8th spirit
moving along the crater surface.

813
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:13,211
Alright.
Now let's take a closer look.

814
01:17:53,996 --> 01:17:55,581
Ready to fire in 3 minutes.

815
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:57,290
Overpack set maximum.

816
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:00,251
Transferring plasma flow to off.

817
01:18:00,251 --> 01:18:01,795
Counter thrusters are engaged.

818
01:18:01,795 --> 01:18:03,588
??? Locks flow the couple. ???

819
01:18:03,588 --> 01:18:05,464
Status is green.

820
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:07,883
We have something on the radar
over the impact site, sir.

821
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:12,303
It's her.

822
01:18:12,303 --> 01:18:13,846
Sir.

823
01:18:13,846 --> 01:18:16,724
Just a traitor on the influence
of the enemy.

824
01:18:17,266 --> 01:18:18,518
Continue the countdown.

825
01:18:19,101 --> 01:18:21,644
We'll take them all out at the
same time.

826
01:18:25,606 --> 01:18:26,899
We're closing on the phantom.

827
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:28,651
Contact in 30 seconds.

828
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:31,528
Target locked.

829
01:18:32,653 --> 01:18:34,279
Ready to fire on your command.

830
01:18:39,201 --> 01:18:41,203
It's a match.
It's a perfect match.

831
01:18:41,745 --> 01:18:42,721
Target scanner is ready, sir.

832
01:18:42,721 --> 01:18:44,080
Fire!

833
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:20,193
What was that?

834
01:19:20,193 --> 01:19:22,571
It's the Zeus.
They're firing on the crater.

835
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:24,281
Aki, Captain, are you alright?

836
01:19:24,281 --> 01:19:25,574
A little shaking.

837
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:26,574
Stand by.

838
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:29,117
Sid,
the 8th spirit is not on our scanner.

839
01:19:29,117 --> 01:19:30,160
Do you have it?

840
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:35,623
The 8th has been destroyed.

841
01:19:35,915 --> 01:19:37,459
What are we going to do now?

842
01:19:37,459 --> 01:19:40,209
Nothing. This mission is over.

843
01:19:40,585 --> 01:19:41,669
We have to get out of here.

844
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:42,378
Incoming!

845
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,656
What is that?

846
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:18,242
If you gonna get us out of here,
you better do it now.

847
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:32,505
Hold on!

848
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,930
I can't hold on to you.

849
01:20:48,517 --> 01:20:50,143
Unable to maintain altitude.

850
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,944
Emergency landing procedures.

851
01:21:24,214 --> 01:21:26,675
Come in, come in, please

852
01:21:27,134 --> 01:21:29,468
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

853
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,928
Sid, I need to talk to the station.

854
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:33,513
Can you patch us through?

855
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,267
What is that thing?

856
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,852
I don't know, sir.

857
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,395
Incoming message, sir.

858
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:44,480
General Hein ,
you must cease fire immediately.

859
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,273
What are you looking at

860
01:21:45,273 --> 01:21:48,776
in the crater is the living spirit
of an alien's home world.

861
01:21:48,776 --> 01:21:51,738
The planet was destroyed and
part of it landed here.

862
01:21:51,738 --> 01:21:53,405
This is not an invasion.

863
01:21:53,739 --> 01:21:55,114
It never was.

864
01:21:55,114 --> 01:21:55,823
Oh, I see.

865
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:58,242
And what we have been
fighting all this time, Doctor?

866
01:21:58,242 --> 01:21:59,535
Ghosts?

867
01:21:59,535 --> 01:22:03,748
Yes, spirits that are confused ,
lost and angry.

868
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:04,456
Oh right?

869
01:22:04,456 --> 01:22:06,875
And these spirits
are coming out of this Gaia thing?

870
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:10,753
-General Hein, you have to listen!
-Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia...

871
01:22:10,753 --> 01:22:12,755
Doctor,
even if I believe in such nonsense,

872
01:22:12,755 --> 01:22:15,215
The fact remains. The Earth is
under attack

873
01:22:15,215 --> 01:22:17,967
from aggressor who must
be destroyed at all cost.

874
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:20,803
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.

875
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:24,264
Firing on the alien Gaia
will only make it stronger.

876
01:22:24,264 --> 01:22:26,391
Since you are under the
alien influence, Doctor,

877
01:22:26,391 --> 01:22:27,792
I will take your protest to mean

878
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:30,394
that we are in fact pursuing
the correct course of action.

879
01:22:30,394 --> 01:22:35,566
I suggest you take your last few moments
and prepare to meet your Gaia.

880
01:22:35,857 --> 01:22:38,192
Continue to fire until the invaders
have been destroyed!

881
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:17,934
General, the system is overheated, sir.

882
01:23:17,934 --> 01:23:19,727
We are going to hit again and again.

883
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:21,729
And keep on hitting it,
until it's dead.

884
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:24,606
But sir, we not even sure if it has
any affect on the creature.

885
01:23:24,606 --> 01:23:25,691
No affect?

886
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:27,859
We've got them in a run,
soldier.

887
01:23:27,859 --> 01:23:30,528
This is our moment of victory.

888
01:23:30,528 --> 01:23:32,154
I order you to fire.

889
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,656
The system won't allow us to fire again.

890
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:36,116
We'll see about that.

891
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:40,161
The shield is out,
we're sitting ducks in here.

892
01:23:40,161 --> 01:23:42,122
Come on.

893
01:24:03,389 --> 01:24:04,974
This is not a good place to be.

894
01:24:13,897 --> 01:24:15,649
What the hell is that?

895
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:18,227
- That's something what I think it is, is it?
- Yes! It's Gaia.

896
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:19,944
It is definitely not a good place to be.

897
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:24,406
Are you alright?

898
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:27,909
I'm fine.
I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

899
01:25:07,275 --> 01:25:09,944
Sid, do you read me?

900
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,280
Go ahead. I'm still here.

901
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:17,076
We are looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, sir? Gaia!

902
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:21,996
I think this explains why the 8th spirit
appeared here.

903
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:25,875
Yes. Yes, that's it.

904
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:28,877
A phantom must have changed
into the 8th spirit

905
01:25:28,877 --> 01:25:31,963
when it touched a new life born
from our own Gaia.

906
01:25:32,171 --> 01:25:35,466
If so, it would have been
given a different energy signature

907
01:25:35,466 --> 01:25:38,093
that set it apart from the
other phantoms.

908
01:25:38,093 --> 01:25:40,720
You two could not have hope

909
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:44,391
for a better location to find
a new compatible spirit.

910
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:46,850
Whatever you do,
don't move.

911
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:48,769
Stay right where you are.

912
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:53,606
Staying right where we are may
not be as easy as it sound.

913
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,569
Don't shoot any of them.
You could very well destroy our last hope.

914
01:25:59,903 --> 01:26:01,637
And what do you suggest I do,
Doctor?

915
01:26:01,637 --> 01:26:03,030
Ask them to play nice?

916
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:07,201
Combat strategy is your area of expertise,
captain, not mine.

917
01:26:08,327 --> 01:26:09,996
I have a reading here in the ___?__?__.

918
01:26:09,996 --> 01:26:11,414
Do you see it?

919
01:26:11,414 --> 01:26:14,039
Yes, a compatible spirit.

920
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:16,166
It must be very near you.

921
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:18,460
Well, Which one is it?

922
01:26:18,919 --> 01:26:20,337
Which one?

923
01:26:20,337 --> 01:26:21,839
I'm having difficulties  __?__?__.

924
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:23,172
Just a moment, please.

925
01:26:25,009 --> 01:26:27,634
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.

926
01:26:27,634 --> 01:26:29,344
Aki, we don't have much time.

927
01:26:29,678 --> 01:26:32,306
Aki...Aki!

928
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:03,256
With the hope of new life,

929
01:28:03,256 --> 01:28:06,342
has Gaia changed the phantom within?

930
01:28:11,222 --> 01:28:14,099
I have it.

931
01:28:20,646 --> 01:28:22,523
Gray, get in here. I need you.

932
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:25,401
Do you hear me, Sid?

933
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:27,276
The wave pattern is complete.

934
01:28:27,276 --> 01:28:29,778
Yes, I read you.
This is wonderful.

935
01:28:29,778 --> 01:28:33,699
I don't see how you could
have found the final spirit.

936
01:28:34,032 --> 01:28:35,367
It found me, Doctor.

937
01:28:41,037 --> 01:28:44,416
I see now. I understand.

938
01:28:44,624 --> 01:28:45,792
Well, I don't understand.

939
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:46,927
What the hell is going on?

940
01:28:46,927 --> 01:28:47,694
Give me your overpack.

941
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:49,134
I need to project the 
completed wave.

942
01:28:49,134 --> 01:28:50,754
But, we'll be defenseless.
- Just do it!

943
01:28:53,007 --> 01:28:54,716
I hope you know what you are
doing, Aki.

944
01:28:54,716 --> 01:28:57,010
We can use the shield
to project the wave.

945
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:00,929
Dr Sid's theory was right.
I have it, the 8th spirit.

946
01:29:01,221 --> 01:29:02,723
I'm cured, Gray.

947
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:04,224
Are you sure you have
the final spirit?

948
01:29:04,224 --> 01:29:06,101
Yes, yes. I'm sure.

949
01:29:06,101 --> 01:29:07,644
But how?
How can you know that?

950
01:29:07,644 --> 01:29:09,478
Don't worry,
the phantom told me.

951
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:11,439
Oh, great.

952
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:13,315
That's it. Shield on.

953
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:20,614
It's not working.

954
01:29:20,614 --> 01:29:22,573
We have to do something
before it's too late.

955
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:25,116
If this doesn't work,
then it's already too late.

956
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:34,832
Gray... trust me.

957
01:30:09,695 --> 01:30:11,280
No! No!

958
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:16,576
Get down!

959
01:30:29,712 --> 01:30:31,672
Warning system overload.

960
01:30:31,672 --> 01:30:32,756
I know.

961
01:30:32,756 --> 01:30:34,424
Warning system overload.

962
01:30:34,424 --> 01:30:35,759
I know!

963
01:30:41,014 --> 01:30:42,098
But it must be done.

964
01:31:25,926 --> 01:31:28,177
Fire! Fire! Damn it!

965
01:31:29,637 --> 01:31:30,680
Fire!

966
01:32:22,807 --> 01:32:24,058
Gray?

967
01:32:24,475 --> 01:32:25,851
Gray!

968
01:32:48,662 --> 01:32:50,580
Don't leave me, Gray.

969
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:54,251
Told Sid this was an one-way trip.

970
01:32:55,835 --> 01:32:57,502
Looks like I was right.

971
01:32:57,502 --> 01:33:00,004
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

972
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:02,048
I still have the wave.

973
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:03,716
We can get through this.

974
01:33:09,388 --> 01:33:10,639
We are not gonna make it.

975
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:11,973
We are going to make it.

976
01:33:11,973 --> 01:33:14,600
We both know that isn't true.

977
01:33:25,025 --> 01:33:27,695
Gray...

978
01:33:27,695 --> 01:33:29,488
Help me.

979
01:33:38,037 --> 01:33:39,121
Gray...

980
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:40,956
Listen to me.

981
01:33:41,164 --> 01:33:45,418
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.

982
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:47,461
Gray, no. Please.

983
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:50,590
Let me do this, Aki.
Trust me.

984
01:34:00,806 --> 01:34:02,683
Don't leave me, Gray.

985
01:34:02,892 --> 01:34:05,517
You have been trying to tell me
the death isn't the end.

986
01:34:05,517 --> 01:34:07,603
Don't back out on me.

987
01:34:08,729 --> 01:34:11,023
Now when I finally believe.

988
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,200
I love you.

989
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:17,462
Oh, it's warm. 
