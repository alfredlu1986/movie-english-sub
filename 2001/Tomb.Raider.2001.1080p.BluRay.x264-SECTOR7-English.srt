1
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,940
Stop!

2
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:35,116
Bugger!

3
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,195
Not live rounds, Lara!

4
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,702
He's in a real pain right now.

5
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,831
This is a major remodel, you know!
This is a disaster!

6
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,331
Was it programmed to stop
before it took my head off?

7
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:54,214
Ah, well... that would be a "no".

8
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:59,888
- But you said, "Make it more challenging."
- Hence, the live fire.

9
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,516
Live rounds again.

10
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,648
Poor Simon!
What has she done to you?

11
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,246
- Very funny.
- I'm trying to turn you into a lady.

12
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,839
- And a lady should be modest.
- Yes. A lady should be modest.

13
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,731
Brothers and sisters,

14
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,951
today is the 15th of May.

15
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,869
The first day of the planetary alignment,

16
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,163
and we are still no nearer to discovering
the location of the key.

17
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:55,122
It seems... we are
running out of time.

18
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,547
This is not acceptable.

19
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:04,431
Mr Powell,
your explanation for this, please.

20
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,975
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

21
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:14,894
Except to respectfully remind the council
that we are working from clues

22
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:20,614
based on ancient cosmological
models... predating Aristotle.

23
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:25,568
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

24
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,242
And I am supremely confident

25
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:33,335
that we will have our answer
in time for the relevant planetary alignment.

26
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,962
So, we will have possession
of the key in...

27
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:43,342
...one week?
- Yes indeed. One week.

28
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,844
This is good news, Mr Powell.

29
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:50,974
But remember,
we have only a single opportunity

30
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,565
to retrieve
the two halves of the triangle.

31
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,935
And if we fail,

32
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,778
we must wait another 5,000 years.

33
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,954
Well, that's more time than I'm prepared
to commit to this enterprise.

34
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:11,618
We shall be ready.

35
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:14,992
Trust me.

36
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,385
- We're not ready, are we?
- No.

37
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:40,895
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

38
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,523
Back to work, I'm afraid.

39
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:46,901
It's adventure time.

40
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:54,289
Egypt again?
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.

41
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,378
I know. Gets everywhere, in the cracks...

42
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,258
Spanish galleon?

43
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,714
Do you know what day it is, Hillary?

44
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,340
Yes, of course...

45
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:16,181
The 15th.

46
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,729
And that is never a good day.

47
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:45,131
I miss you, Daddy.

48
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:51,723
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

49
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,660
My father would love to have seen this.

50
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:22,373
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

51
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:26,587
It's the first stage of the alignment
of all nine planets

52
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,795
culminating in a full solar eclipse.

53
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:31,930
It only happens
once every 5,000 years.

54
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,304
- When is the eclipse?
- In one week from today.

55
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,264
But there is plenty
to look out for until then.

56
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,194
Incredible.

57
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,602
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.

58
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,053
Mummy!

59
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,435
I wish I could remember her, too.

60
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,986
- I still have you, Daddy.
- Yes, you do.

61
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:39,573
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle

62
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,955
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

63
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,332
But that will prove to be
just long enough

64
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,041
for little Lara Croft to grow up...

65
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,005
...and to find it.

66
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:57,632
Bryce!

67
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:02,717
Hello, fellas. How's business?

68
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,231
OK, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

69
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:14,482
We have 83 rooms.
Can't you live in the house?

70
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,614
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.

71
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,366
Right.

72
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:25,409
- What's that smell?
- 5 am. Let's go.

73
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:30,459
This had better be good.

74
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:38,009
- It's a clock.
- I found it last night.

75
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,880
It was ticking.

76
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,175
Must be one of them
"ticking clocks", eh?

77
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,271
It was hidden in a secret room.

78
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,813
- Don't start.
- Well, Lara, it's a clock.

79
00:15:56,947 --> 00:16:00,363
It ticks, it tells the time. It's wrong.

80
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:05,156
It started ticking last night,
during the first stage of the alignment.

81
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,202
Well, I need some coffee.

82
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,169
OK, in we go.

83
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,216
It looks pretty ordinary to me.

84
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,474
Keep looking.

85
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,140
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with non-fat milk.

86
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,945
Oh, champion.
Steaming sump oil.

87
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:49,206
- Wait, what did you do?
- I don't know. What did I do?

88
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,075
- Where is that?
- Don't know.

89
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,295
I just took my hand off the fibre optics.
What is that?

90
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:59,378
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.

91
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:06,507
Screw thirteen
to quadrant four.

92
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,893
Screw fourteen
to quadrant three.

93
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,599
Oh, please.

94
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,851
It's my map,
so I know where they all came from.

95
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,026
It's camouflage.

96
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,948
OK.

97
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,338
Hidden within.

98
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:48,846
What is that?

99
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:56,142
The All-Seeing Eye.

100
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:13,414
Lot 121, a Louis the Fifteenth
Ormolu mounted bracket clock.

101
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:15,827
Showing on my left.

102
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,461
£1,800,000.
1,800,000, thank you.

103
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,422
1,800,000... 1,900,000...
£2,000,000 now.

104
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,296
2,100,000...

105
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,632
£2,100,000 now.
£2,100,000.

106
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:31,767
Any advance on £2,100,000?
Any more?

107
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,848
2,200,000.
Thank you, sir.

108
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,567
£2,200,000.
At 2,200,000... 2,300,000...

109
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,604
2,400,000.

110
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:46,439
Lady's bid.
£2,400,000 now.

111
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,197
Against you, sir.
2,500,000? No?

112
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,029
£2,400,000 then.
lady's bid at 2,400,000.

113
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:58,290
£2,500,000.
And a new place at £2,500,000.

114
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:01,920
Any more at £2,500,000?

115
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,294
Sold.

116
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:08,971
- Lara, my dear.
- Mr Wilson.

117
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,134
Let's go to my study.
Let me take that for you.

118
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,891
Lara Croft.
I don't believe it.

119
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:18,476
I'll just be a minute.

120
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:28,106
You still pretending to be
a photojournalist?

121
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:31,777
It's really cool
that you still have a day job.

122
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:34,823
Even though
it's obviously just for show.

123
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,950
So, Alex... are you still pretending to be
an archaeologist?

124
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:46,086
Lara, do we always have to fight?

125
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,089
I mean, maybe we don't?

126
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,262
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

127
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,476
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? From you?

128
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:59,303
That's funny!
It's not like you owned them.

129
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,610
Hey, you're the tomb raider.

130
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:08,899
- Mr West, we are ready for you.
- I think your clients need you.

131
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:13,025
Go ahead,
you're wanted on the floor.

132
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:17,405
After all, as you once said
so memorably, "It's all just a business."

133
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,867
Right? So go do business.

134
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:50,314
Lara, this is a unique object.

135
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:55,202
Only one of the dials is working.
It glows, like the eye.

136
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:58,413
Lesser, but it seems
to be getting brighter.

137
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,789
And it's also running backwards.

138
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,169
Like it's not so much keeping time,
but counting down to something.

139
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,005
- Yes.
- And look at the back.

140
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,917
It's as though it fits into something,
almost like a key.

141
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,802
Yes. Yes, fascinating.
Incredibly beautiful.

142
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,263
My father told me of a magical triangle
stamped with the All-Seeing Eye.

143
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,477
He said it gave its possessor
the power to control time.

144
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:32,313
He called it the Triangle of Light.

145
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,653
- Have you heard of it?
- No, I haven't.

146
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:45,501
He always steered his own course,
your father.

147
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,253
He was a great man.

148
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,543
Would you like some port?

149
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,181
- It's really very fine.
- No.

150
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,633
I can't help you, Lara.

151
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:03,849
This clock truly is a mystery.

152
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:26,162
- Hello?
- Lara?

153
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,703
Hello, it's Mr Wilson. Yes...

154
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:34,463
Well, you see...
I had a second thought about that clock.

155
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,546
There is a man
who may be able to help you.

156
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:41,097
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.

157
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:45,474
- You should see him.
- Thank you, I will.

158
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:48,394
- Goodbye, Lara.
- You take care.

159
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:49,557
Thank you.

160
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,815
Bugger.

161
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,339
Forgive me.

162
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:30,936
- Lady Croft.
- Ah, Mr Powell.

163
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:35,896
No, no, heavens, no.
I'm actually his associate, Mr Pimms.

164
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:40,196
Yeah, like the beverage.

165
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,122
Yeah, she's here.

166
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,709
What does Mr Powell do?

167
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,462
He's a lawyer
and I'm his law clerk.

168
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:05,095
A fairly recent appointment,
but enjoying it, all the varied work.

169
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:09,017
- A lawyer?
- Isn't it obvious?

170
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,017
Lady Croft, my pleasure.

171
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:16,065
- Manfred Powell, QC.
- Good morning.

172
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:21,322
- You're an authority on things Ancient.
- Well, I travel.

173
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:24,868
No, no. Mr Wilson said
you were quite the archaeologist.

174
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,037
Please.

175
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:31,662
- Oh, he's very sweet.
- He knew you father, I believe?

176
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:39,251
- Yes, they were great friends.
- I had the honour of meeting him once...

177
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:41,296
in Venice.

178
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,467
I was so sorry
to hear about his death.

179
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:52,641
This is the clock I spoke of.

180
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:57,729
Very interesting.

181
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,023
It's a shame you only brought
photographs.

182
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,157
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.

183
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,494
You said it started ticking
the night of the alignment?

184
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,750
Yes.

185
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,384
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.

186
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:23,632
And the study of clocks
is a hobby?

187
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,424
This is an obsession.

188
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:30,434
Really my specialty.
My practice centres around antiquities.

189
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:35,727
But the origin of this clock
completely eludes me.

190
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:43,115
I've never seen anything quite
so beautiful that I know so little about.

191
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,323
This is a pleasurable torment.

192
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,075
My ignorance amuses me.

193
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,875
"My ignorance amuses me."

194
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:05,799
Yes, I've always found your ignorance
quite amusing.

195
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,970
- Powell, however, is not ignorant.
- No?

196
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:12,140
No. He's a liar.

197
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,111
- Anything you need?
- No, thank you, Hillary.

198
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:32,200
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.

199
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:14,874
Alpha team, cover the front.
Forward team, wait for my command.

200
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:23,460
We are in position,
awaiting your order.

201
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:48,833
Bastards!

202
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:52,088
Bloody hell!

203
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:59,145
On the left!

204
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:22,996
Come on, Simon.

205
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,164
Come on!

206
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,820
Lara, are you there?
Pick up!

207
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,373
Lara, are you OK?

208
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:30,876
Bryce, I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my clock!

209
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,038
I know.

210
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:39,097
- Bryce, you have to be my eyes.
- Right, are you armed?

211
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:43,100
After a fashion, yes.

212
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:47,646
All right, three bad guys. Number one,
standing by the Aston Martin.

213
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:48,846
Right.

214
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:53,313
Bingo!

215
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:12,001
- Next.
- OK, number 2,

216
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,294
crouched by the McLaren.

217
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:18,084
Oh, bugger!

218
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:31,268
- Are you OK?
- I just found my car keys.

219
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,907
You are done, mate.
Nice one!

220
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:10,824
- I think they have all gone.
- Well, they got what they came for.

221
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:17,085
- Sorry about that.
- That's fine.

222
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:00,037
Hello?

223
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:08,216
What the hell happened here?

224
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:19,521
- Good morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?

225
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:22,818
Yes.
You have something for me?

226
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,040
I woke up this morning
and I just hated everything.

227
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:38,243
Right. Thanks.

228
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:46,337
Who is Stribling, Clive
and Winterset?

229
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,468
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- The are a bunch of lawyers.

230
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:54,510
- Oh. Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosey.

231
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:59,307
I'm not nosey. I saw it was a funny name.
I just asked what the name was.

232
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:05,314
- Lara?
- It's from my father.

233
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:13,902
It was written before he died and
delivered today as per his instructions.

234
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,161
- Blimey.
- Holy shh...

235
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:31,548
"To see a world in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild flower

The All-Seeing Eye.

239

"My darling daughter,
I knew you would figure this out.

240

I'm no longer with you

244

discovered the clock I concealed.

But it is no bedtime story.

I'll be calling in a favour.

275
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:01,339
What kind of favour?

276
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:06,303
Well, that is a secret.
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.

278
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,203
Right on target.
Thank you, boys. Over and out.

279
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,361
Ah, Mr Powell.
How predictable.

280

Alex West.
What are you doing here?

281
00:41:54,922 --> 00:41:58,042
We have 72 minutes
to the next alignment.

282
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,086
We have to work faster.

283
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,595
Come on, guys!

284
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:55,522
Come on, guys!
Come on, pull! Pull, it's coming!

285
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:08,907
Good.

286
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:47,449
- So, any sign of Lady Croft?
- Not yet.

287
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:51,825
Lara is overrated. She is good,
don't get me wrong,

288
00:43:51,956 --> 00:43:56,416
but she's in it for the glory.
Whereas I'm in it for the money.

289
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:58,536
Fortunately.

290
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:02,170
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.

Jasmine.

292
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:02,594
Remember, what we're looking for is
hidden not only in space, but also in time.

293
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,557
The clock is the key.

294
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:17,325
My God.

295
00:47:25,669 --> 00:47:28,207
"Return the eye

We have two minutes, Mr West.
You're the tomb raider, figure it out!

302

Mr West, tempus fugit.

303
00:48:12,466 --> 00:48:15,040
Yes, time flies.

304
00:48:15,344 --> 00:48:16,719
It's the swords.

305
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:21,338
Come on guys, get up here.
Give me a hand here.

306
00:48:25,896 --> 00:48:29,100
That's it. Come on, coming down.

307
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,194
I want them all down.
Carry them across the ladders.

308
00:48:34,405 --> 00:48:35,899
Come on, let's hustle!

309
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:41,988
All right, now slide them
into the slots over there.

310
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,948
We place the clock here
at the exact moment of alignment.

311
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,291
Come on, let's go, move it!

312
00:48:51,422 --> 00:48:53,995
Too slow, ladies, too slow.
Come on!

313
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,639
- That's it.
- Count it down.

314
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:07,473
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.

315
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:37,049
60 seconds to go.
59, 58,

316
00:49:37,176 --> 00:49:39,963
57, 56,

317
00:49:40,096 --> 00:49:41,922
55,

318
00:49:42,056 --> 00:49:43,716
54,

319
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:46,720
53, 52,

320
00:49:46,852 --> 00:49:49,639
51, 50 seconds...

321
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:59,115
Cease fire! Hold your fire!

322
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:06,823
- Keep counting.
- You are making a big mistake.

323
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:17,048
- Tourist visa?
- No, I'm working.

324
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,791
Is there a good reason
why I just kept you alive?

325
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:23,633
Yes. That's not the true eye.

326
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:29,351
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually. It's a mirror image.

327
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:33,056
You're trying to cheat me out of
my little ray of sunshine.

328
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,852
Why would I cheat you? I need you
to get it so I can steal it from you later.

329
00:50:37,987 --> 00:50:40,525
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note.

330
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:43,147
Kill Miss Croft,
if she attempts any such thing.

331
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:44,861
Yes, sir.

332
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:48,488
We can do it my way,
or come back for the next alignment.

333
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:50,911
You're welcome
to try and kill me then.

334
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,829
In, say, another 5,000 years.

335
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:02,924
12, 11, 10...

336
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:09,766
9, 8, 7, 6...

337
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:14,017
5, 4...

338
00:51:15,608 --> 00:51:20,020
3, 2, 1...

339
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,771
Zero.

340
00:51:28,537 --> 00:51:30,115
I guess she was right.

341
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:42,624
The log must pierce the urn.

342
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:49,724
Come on.

343
00:51:51,894 --> 00:51:55,595
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.

344
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,903
Pure light, fire and water.

345
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,750
- Get the clock.
- Got it.

346
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:23,378
Hold it right there.

347
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:32,518
- Give it up.
- Are you going to shoot me, Alex?

348
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:34,157
My phone is wet.

349
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:49,345
- Lady Croft, how are you?
- Alive.

350
01:00:49,473 --> 01:00:52,676
- And kicking, I hope.
- Yeah, and you?

351
01:00:52,935 --> 01:00:57,644
Superlative. Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.

352
01:00:57,773 --> 01:00:59,813
And you have my father's clock.

353
01:00:59,942 --> 01:01:03,192
Listen, my dear, without each other
we are quite useless at this point.

354
01:01:03,738 --> 01:01:06,063
We should re-evaluate
our positions.

355
01:01:06,198 --> 01:01:10,326
You and I are in business together.
We should have a business meeting.

356
01:01:10,494 --> 01:01:14,741
You mean you love to have
another opportunity to try and kill me.

357
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:17,657
Oh, that's harsh.

358
01:01:17,793 --> 01:01:20,878
But perhaps. Wait and see.

359
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:24,125
Come to Venice, Via Dolorosa.

360
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:26,667
Wonderful. Bye, then.

361
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:32,306
Harder.

362
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:40,931
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.
Look out! It's some sort of machine.

363
01:01:42,026 --> 01:01:45,027
- Hello?
- Bryce it's me.

364
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,230
- Hello?
- Bryce, it's Lara.

365
01:01:47,364 --> 01:01:50,282
I found the temple.
Ran into Mr Powell.

366
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:53,861
- Did you get the clock?
- No, but I got the first piece.

367
01:01:53,996 --> 01:01:56,072
Oh, beautiful, smashing.

368
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:58,283
Seems I'm level begging
with Mr Powell.

369
01:01:58,417 --> 01:02:01,122
- Won't he want to kill you now?
- No, silly.

370
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:05,204
His problem is that he needs
the piece that I have.

371
01:02:05,341 --> 01:02:07,832
Until then, I'm his new best friend.

372
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:09,131
What about the other half?

373
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:12,547
The final alignment
is in 66 hours and 53 minutes.

374
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:16,300
We've still got no idea
where the second piece is hidden.

375
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:18,724
He's going to tell me
where it is.

376
01:02:18,854 --> 01:02:22,140
- He will?
- Trust me. Pack for Venice.

377
01:02:22,274 --> 01:02:24,979
Pack for where? Hello? Lara?

378
01:02:28,155 --> 01:02:29,614
Bye then.

379
01:02:59,437 --> 01:03:00,717
Drink.

380
01:03:04,108 --> 01:03:05,353
Rest.

381
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,234
There is no rest
for the wicked.

382
01:03:10,406 --> 01:03:13,989
- You got what you came for?
- I did, yes.

383
01:03:14,118 --> 01:03:16,656
Too bad. Bad for the world.

384
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,538
- The world is safe now.
- A little bit safer, perhaps.

385
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:25,500
Because you will go on.

386
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:28,630
Your father said
you will never give up.

387
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:31,758
My father?
You knew my father?

388
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:35,842
Now drink. Finish your tea.

389
01:03:38,642 --> 01:03:42,854
It tastes quite bad,
but it's good for you.

390
01:03:43,439 --> 01:03:44,470
See?

391
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:25,719
Good evening.

392
01:04:29,402 --> 01:04:31,560
You're with the Illuminati.

393
01:04:34,824 --> 01:04:38,109
I beg your pardon?
There's no such thing.

394
01:04:38,244 --> 01:04:39,702
It's just a bedtime story.

395
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,749
- Illuminati.
- The People of the Light.

396
01:04:54,343 --> 01:04:56,336
Have you brought my triangle?

397
01:04:56,887 --> 01:05:00,303
No. Of course, you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

398
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:05,020
Well, you can keep
the triangle you have...

399
01:05:05,146 --> 01:05:08,645
and I will keep your father's clock
and we can be partners.

400
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,775
Who sits here?

401
01:05:12,945 --> 01:05:16,112
We can be partners
and go for the big prize.

402
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,617
- The Triangle of Light.
- Yes, but who sits here?

403
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:25,364
It's an incredible dream.
An awesome power.

404
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:31,581
- It could set right so many wrongs.
- I don't think you sit here, do you?

405
01:05:43,267 --> 01:05:48,225
I sit here...
on God's right hand, as it were.

406
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:55,062
In fact, I now sit exactly
where your father sat.

407
01:06:00,076 --> 01:06:01,356
You're lying.

408
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:06,578
No, he mentored me in the order.

409
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:11,128
It was truly an honour.

410
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:13,538
I don't believe you.

411
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:17,961
My father was not with the Illuminati.
He would have told me.

412
01:06:18,094 --> 01:06:20,252
He had a great many secrets.

413
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:27,014
- Not from me.
- Especially from you.

414
01:06:31,899 --> 01:06:35,813
- I know what you want, Lara.
- Oh, I doubt it.

415
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,700
Another life with your father.

416
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,205
A second chance.

417
01:06:51,335 --> 01:06:55,249
It will be within my power to give.

418
01:06:55,423 --> 01:07:00,334
The triangle gives its possessor
the power of God...

419
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:05,806
...to move back and forth
through time, undo the past.

420
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:11,141
Help me and you will get
what I know you want.

421
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:14,600
To have your father
returned to you.

422
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,399
How do I know that once
I gave you that piece

423
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:23,738
that you wouldn't
try to kill me?

424
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:29,494
Would it make it easier for you?

425
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:34,579
On more familiar ground...
if I killed you now?

426
01:07:36,505 --> 01:07:38,047
Will you reconsider?

427
01:08:39,318 --> 01:08:41,026
Hello, Alex.

428
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:45,863
You think I'm a greedy, unscrupulous
sell-out who'd do anything for money?

429
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:50,238
- Yes, that's right.
- Well, the money bit's true, I guess.

430
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,290
Is it, Alex?

431
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:01,334
If you cross me, we may not be able
to remain friends.

432
01:09:06,137 --> 01:09:08,213
Always a pleasure.

433
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:13,266
Now for a cold shower.

434
01:09:14,603 --> 01:09:17,889
- We're in big trouble.
- Hold this, will you?

435
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:21,309
They already think that we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

436
01:09:21,444 --> 01:09:25,062
Yes, they think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

437
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:27,230
Is it?

438
01:09:27,366 --> 01:09:31,150
Why don't you worry about
something else? Of course, it's not.

439
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:35,331
I don't understand. What chance of
success do we have without the piece?

440
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:39,284
- Zero. Don't dwell on it.
- But...

441
01:09:46,552 --> 01:09:48,545
What a nice surprise.

442
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,430
Thank you.

443
01:09:55,561 --> 01:09:58,479
Now, time to save the universe
again then, is it?

444
01:09:58,606 --> 01:10:00,515
Absolutely.

445
01:10:34,642 --> 01:10:38,141
Are we sure
she is really necessary?

446
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,141
One tomb raider is good,
two... better.

447
01:10:50,074 --> 01:10:53,525
My bum has gone asleep again,
all down the left cheek.

448
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:56,366
Really? That's fascinating.

449
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:04,376
- How much longer?
- A few hours.

450
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:07,123
We have to take the last hour
overland.

451
01:11:07,299 --> 01:11:10,253
Helicopters won't fly
near the ruined city.

452
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:14,093
It's a dead zone.

453
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:58,382
We take all doggies, da?

454
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:03,179
Mucho U.S. greenback, da?
All doggies.

455
01:13:57,094 --> 01:14:00,048
Welcome to the dead zone.

456
01:14:14,445 --> 01:14:17,197
It's not a country, it's an ice cube.

457
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,784
Come on!

458
01:15:50,499 --> 01:15:52,492
Right.
Let's go.

459
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:47,802
Go on, get it!

460
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,012
Holy shit!

461
01:16:58,317 --> 01:17:02,267
It's a time storm.
Time is broken here.

462
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:06,239
We must find the Eye!
All of you! Hurry!

463
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:08,985
We are running out of time!
Hurry!

464
01:17:28,889 --> 01:17:30,134
It's begun.

465
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:36,764
50 bucks says the piece
is inside the sun.

466
01:18:19,815 --> 01:18:23,599
For God's sake, hurry!
The eclipse will be over in a few minutes.

467
01:18:31,118 --> 01:18:34,155
Alex, give me the clock,
I know what to do.

468
01:19:28,843 --> 01:19:30,301
Has she got the piece?

469
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:47,938
We will now unite these two parts.
The past and the present.

470
01:19:49,488 --> 01:19:52,489
At last, we of the Illuminati

471
01:19:52,616 --> 01:19:58,037
will control time and fulfil
the sacred promise to our ancestors.

472
01:19:58,581 --> 01:20:02,744
- Soon the entire world...
- Enough of this twaddle.

473
01:20:08,507 --> 01:20:09,836
Come on!

474
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:39,442
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr Powell?

475
01:20:43,918 --> 01:20:48,793
Oh, Lara,
I have a gut instinct about this.

476
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:53,675
After all, you are the daughter
of a genius.

477
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:55,427
Let me test my theory.

478
01:21:46,564 --> 01:21:49,897
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.

479
01:21:51,402 --> 01:21:53,608
You show me
how to complete the triangle

480
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:55,730
and we can change his fate.

481
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:01,613
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.

482
01:22:01,746 --> 01:22:03,240
It's only a little trip back in time.

483
01:22:04,623 --> 01:22:08,835
But I'm pretty sure you've figured out
the answer to the problem.

484
01:22:10,755 --> 01:22:14,373
And then, of course,
there's the loss of your father.

485
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,590
I can change that.

486
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:30,855
You'd better be ready for this.

487
01:22:37,698 --> 01:22:41,150
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it!

488
01:23:18,489 --> 01:23:21,360
To see a world in a grain of sand.

489
01:23:47,518 --> 01:23:49,676
Oh, God!

490
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:55,975
Daddy?

491
01:24:04,618 --> 01:24:06,694
Is this real?

492
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:12,083
It is a crossing of my past
and your present.

493
01:24:13,377 --> 01:24:15,500
Why did you not tell me
about the Illuminati?

494
01:24:16,338 --> 01:24:18,046
You were only a child.

495
01:24:18,174 --> 01:24:21,839
You could have written it in your journals.
You never mentioned it. Not once.

496
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:24,045
I burst to tell you everything,

497
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,931
but in the fierceness
of my own battles,

498
01:24:27,058 --> 01:24:32,432
I told you only that which would
inspire you and keep you safe.

499
01:24:32,563 --> 01:24:34,271
I love you so much.

500
01:24:35,858 --> 01:24:40,319
- I have missed you.
- And I have missed you.

501
01:24:43,908 --> 01:24:47,324
I know why you came here,
why you took the power of the light.

502
01:24:47,453 --> 01:24:50,822
- But this must not happen.
- Why?

503
01:24:50,956 --> 01:24:54,076
Why can't we use the power
just this once?

504
01:24:55,044 --> 01:24:59,753
- Why can't you stay?
- We can't change time.

505
01:25:01,092 --> 01:25:06,715
But time was stolen from us...
and it's not fair.

506
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:09,631
No, it's not fair.

507
01:25:10,434 --> 01:25:15,642
But you have stolen time itself
and you must give it back.

508
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,775
You must destroy the triangle.

509
01:25:21,737 --> 01:25:26,316
- Suddenly I feel so alone.
- You are never alone.

510
01:25:26,992 --> 01:25:30,112
I am with you always,
just as I've always been.

511
01:27:12,306 --> 01:27:13,800
Move out!

512
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:30,104
Wait! Your father begged for his life

513
01:27:30,241 --> 01:27:32,732
when we caught him betraying us.

514
01:27:32,868 --> 01:27:35,324
He pleaded like a baby.

515
01:27:35,538 --> 01:27:37,162
Surrender.

516
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:40,707
Never.

517
01:27:43,587 --> 01:27:48,084
He seemed particularly concerned
that I should not take this.

518
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:57,218
Lara, no.
The place is coming down!

519
01:27:57,351 --> 01:28:00,767
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.

520
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:07,309
You just hurry.

521
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:22,242
There you go.
Safe and sound.

522
01:28:33,554 --> 01:28:35,345
No guns.

523
01:31:32,108 --> 01:31:34,231
Oh, my God!

524
01:31:36,737 --> 01:31:37,982
Quiet.

525
01:32:11,397 --> 01:32:13,436
What?
