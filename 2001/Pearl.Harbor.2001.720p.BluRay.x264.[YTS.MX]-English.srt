1
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:01,046
- German bandits at 2 o'clock!
- Increase throttle! Power dive!

2
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,323
Spell it right, Rafe.

3
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:11,686
"Rudder" is spelled with two D's.

4
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,758
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.

5
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,164
Whoa, bandits!

6
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,721
- Crack shootin', Danny.
- Crack shootin', Rafe.

7
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,684
- Land ofthe free.
- Home ofthe brave.

8
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,483
Great flyin', Dad!

9
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:47,482
Come on. I'm gonna
teach you how to fly.

10
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:57,118
- I get the front!
- No, you take the back.

11
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,277
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.

12
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,483
I'm older and I'm teachin',
so no.

13
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,718
- Wow. It's like we're really flying.
- Yeah, I did it lots oftimes.

14
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,560
Come on. You man the guns.
I'll give her some throttle.

15
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,524
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.

16
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,238
Oh, gosh!

17
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,435
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!

18
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,598
I've seen my dad do this
lots oftimes. Don't worry!

19
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,398
Rafe!

20
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:38,002
- Oh, my gosh! We're flying!
- We're flying!

21
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:57,280
My dad's gonna kill me.
Come on.

22
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:01,367
Yes! Woo-hoo!

23
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,325
- We flew!
- We flew! Yes! I'm a pilot!

24
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:06,045
- I know!
- Yeah!

25
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,206
We flew.

26
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:10,959
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy!

27
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:14,801
I done told you, you spend time playing
with this stupid boy, can't read...

28
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,445
you ain't never gonna
amount to nothin'!

29
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:19,724
He ain't stupid, Daddy!
Daddy!

30
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:23,441
Come on!

31
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:28,045
Get on back home. Now!

32
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,485
Get on up.
You got work to do.

33
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,922
Come on!
Come on. Get on home!

34
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,244
You let him alone!

35
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,285
Daddy, no!

36
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,916
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!

37
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,726
What'd you call me?

38
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:53,356
I fought the Germans
in France.

39
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,598
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.

40
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,963
And I pray to God no one ever
has to see the things that I saw.

41
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:18,203
You're my best friend.

42
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,326
Daddy, wait!

43
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,519
Daddy, wait.

44
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,125
AdolfHitlerbuilds
the German militarymachine...

45
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,198
anddrags
allofEurope into war.

46
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,198
But even while France falls to Hitler...

47
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:42,199
America stillrefuses
tojoin the fighting.

48
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,687
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

49
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:05,198
All right, Danny.
Now, let's show 'em how to fly.

50
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,720
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?

51
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,798
This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no crop dusters.

52
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:11,117
- I'm not playing chicken with ya.
- Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,721
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.

54
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,604
You can turn oryou can hit me.
It's up to you.

55
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,643
- What the--
- Oh, boy.

56
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,441
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?

57
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,880
Which way you goin'?

58
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,841
I guess I'll go right.
No, left. I'll go left.

59
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,482
- Okay, we're goin' left, right?
- Uh. right. Right?

60
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,717
"Right" Iike we're going right
or "right" Iike we're going left?

61
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,243
Now you got me all mixed up!
I don't know. Make up your mind.

62
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,245
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!

63
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,598
Those are some smooth aces.

64
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:00,598
Did you say something?

65
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,837
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

66
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:07,682
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

67
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,520
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:13,485
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

69
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,762
After two years oftraining...

70
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:19,522
you believe that a $45,000 aeroplane
is there foryour amusement?

71
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:21,996
No, sir. I wasjust trying
to keep my edge, Major.

72
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:24,601
And when you did the outside loop
last week, what did you think that was?

73
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,245
Honing your skills?

74
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,682
That's not training, McCawley.
That's a stunt.

75
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:34,239
And I personally consider it
to be reckless and irresponsible.

76
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,442
Major.

77
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,000
How could that be when you're famous
for being the first man in the world
ever to do it?

78
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,237
- Don't get cute with me, son.
- No, sir. I--

79
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:47,206
I don't mean to be disrespectful.
I just think that-- Well, l--

80
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,676
It is reckless and irresponsible if
you'rejust doing it to be a show-off.

81
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:53,237
But I was doing it
to try to inspire the men, sir...

82
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:54,646
in the way that
you've inspired me.

83
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,683
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

84
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,439
when the men get together
to honour their leaders.

85
00:06:58,527 --> 00:06:59,846
They call it an homage, sir.

86
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:01,679
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

87
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,200
That's bullshit, McCawley!

88
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,485
But it's very, very good bullshit.

89
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,797
Thankyou, sir.

90
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,757
McCawley, you remind me
of myself 1 5 years ago.

91
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,724
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

92
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:21,045
Have a seat, son.

93
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,720
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

94
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:36,404
You're on your way to England
tomorrow, ifyou still want to go.

95
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:37,681
Wow.

96
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,678
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

97
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,201
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

98
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,879
They're gonna need all the help
they can get.

99
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,320
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.

100
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,485
Just for the record, I'm supposed
to askyou to reconsider.

101
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,001
- Sir?
- Sooner or later...

102
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,885
we're gonna be in this war
whether we like it or not.

103
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,276
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

104
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,006
So it's my duty
to askyou to stay.

105
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,965
Major, what would you do?

106
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:06,998
If it was me...

107
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:10,965
I'd go.

108
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,283
God! Am I going bald
right back here?

109
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,436
Ooh!

110
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,803
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son ofa bitch.

111
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,240
Don't you ever die.

112
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:24,845
Die. That's exactly the concept
you gotta work tonight.

113
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,124
You put a drop ofthis clove oil
underyour eyes...

114
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,118
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

115
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,836
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

116
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,203
Iet her see your eyes glisten
and say...

117
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,324
"Baby, they're training me for war...

118
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,762
and I don't know
what'll happen...

119
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,758
but if I die tomorrow...

120
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:49,875
I want to know that we lived
all we could tonight."

121
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,798
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

122
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,526
Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

123
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,518
How could you do this?

124
00:08:58,047 --> 00:08:59,275
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

125
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,598
He wanted me to get some real--
real combat training in.

126
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:03,802
Well, guess what?

127
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,082
It's not training over there.
It's war...

128
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,078
where the losers die
and there aren't any winners...

129
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,397
just guys who turn into
broken-down wrecks like my father.

130
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,921
Yeah, I understand that, Danny,
but I feel like I got a duty to go.

131
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:16,716
Don't preach to me about duty, damn it.
I wear the same uniform you do.

132
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,686
Now, iftrouble wants me, I'm ready
for it, but why go looking for it?

133
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:24,919
God, Danny, come on. I'm gonna be 25.
I might as well be an old man.

134
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,282
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

135
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,278
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.

136
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,881
- I wanna be a combat fighter.
- Hey, come on!

137
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,959
The nurses can't
d-d-dance by themselves.

138
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:36,605
Let's go.

139
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:49,195
Ifthe call to duty means seeing
1 50 men in their underwear every day...

140
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,562
we are here to serve.

141
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:55,117
I can't believe it.
Saturday night in New York City.

142
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:58,165
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from? Nothing.

143
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,919
Cow tipping.

144
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,201
That's why
you joined the navy, hon.

145
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:03,198
Get out ofthat dusty little town
and see the world.

146
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,960
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're navy nurses, not tourists.

147
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:09,198
I joined to do my patriotic duty
and to meet guys.

148
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,160
Me too.

149
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,885
Girls, we're gonna have so much fun
tonight in the city.

150
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,366
You gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

151
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,244
What?

152
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,442
Oh, come on. Tell us.

153
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:21,997
- Oh, it's such a long story.
- We got time.

154
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,281
I saw it happen.

155
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,595
Well, it was about four weeks ago.

156
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,918
What do you think
is b-better?

157
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:31,602
All in the one cheek
or spreading them out?

158
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:32,597
Okay.

159
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,803
Fusco, Anthony.

160
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,244
You all right, buddy?

161
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:43,477
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

162
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,206
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

163
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:49,359
No? lfyou'd rather,
she can do it.

164
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,917
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
J-J-Just gimme a minute.

165
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:59,158
Honey, the government says
stick 'em, we stick 'em.

166
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:04,606
Hey, Red, you all right?

167
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,798
Eye exam number four?

168
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,597
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

169
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:15,803
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

170
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,242
Sorry, son.

171
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,285
I'm gonna fail.
They're gonna take my wings away.

172
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,517
No, they won't.Just relax.

173
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:25,006
Read the bottom line, please.

174
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,361
Just keep practisin'
the bottom line.

175
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:28,119
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

176
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,801
J-L-M-K-P-O--

177
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,718
Thankyou.

178
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:37,479
- Next.
- Ma'am.

179
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:44,719
J-L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

180
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,559
Slow down, flyboy.

181
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,161
And instead ofthe bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

182
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,603
"C." Sorry. "J."

183
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:02,603
"C," "W," uh, "Q", uh, "Q"

184
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:08,883
Read the bottom line again, please,
but read it right to left...

185
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,003
and every other letter.

186
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:21,676
E-X--

187
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,962
- X-E.
- X-E.

188
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,277
X-E, ma'am.

189
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,835
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

190
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,599
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I really am...

191
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:32,643
but army and navy
requires 20/20 vision.

192
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:36,197
Oh, l-- It's not a problem
with my eyes. I mean, I can see.

193
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,198
I mean, I can hit a running rabbit
with a $3.00 pistol.

194
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,720
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

195
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,924
Well, maybe after some schooling,
you could come back
and take the test again.

196
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,397
No, I had schooling.
I mean, the teachersjust
never knew what to make of it.

197
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:48,523
It'sjust letters.
I mix 'em up sometimes. That's all.

198
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:52,077
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

199
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:56,638
Look here. My math and spacial reasoning
and my verbal scores are all excellent.

200
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,558
But you barely passed
the written exam.

201
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,683
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So is it my turn now?

202
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,837
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:06,078
Ma'am, I'm never gonna be
an English teacher.

204
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:10,080
But I know why I'm here:
to be a pilot.

205
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:13,204
And you don't dogfight with manuals.
You don't fly with gauges.

206
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,845
It is all about feeling and speed...

207
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,883
and lettin' that plane become
like a part ofyour body.

208
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:20,039
And that manual says that a guy who's
a slow reader can't be a good pilot.

209
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:23,563
That file says
I'm the best pilot in this room.

210
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:30,642
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

211
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,959
Well, I felt so bad.

212
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,720
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

213
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,001
I had no choice.

214
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:40,043
I passed him.

215
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:44,046
So then this cocky pilot
comes back.

216
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,357
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,358
"Yeah"?
Boy, you're talking to an officer.

218
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,358
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
- Give me that file.

219
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,085
- Yes, sir.
- Parade rest.

220
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,282
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,959
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thankyou.

222
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,322
Drop your skiwies.

223
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,159
Oh. Okay.

224
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,957
Just like this?

225
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,116
That's fine.

226
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:06,277
He did have a very cute butt.

227
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,437
You know, I know you didn't have
to pass me, and you did.

228
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,200
And I just-- I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

229
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:14,677
You know, you still
haven't said thankyou.

230
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,565
- Thankyou.
- You're welcome.

231
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:20,605
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

232
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:22,200
You're like my hero now.

233
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,118
Actually, my father was a pilot...

234
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:27,836
and I've seen firsthand what happens
when a pilot loses his wings.

235
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:31,158
You know what?
Your father's my hero then too.

236
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,762
In fact, as an officer,
I think it'd be my duty...

237
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,600
to take my new hero's daughter out
tonightjust to--

238
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:43,246
- Gosh, did I poke too deep?
- I thinkyou hit the bone there.

239
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,086
You are so mean.

240
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,963
What, so is-- so is there any chance
that you might kind of, sort of...

241
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,515
you know, like me, or--

242
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,518
How did you guess?

243
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,441
They never taught us how
to deal with this feeling.

244
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,558
What feeling?

245
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:11,604
Well, it's kind of like this.

246
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:15,081
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

247
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:19,117
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

248
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,198
Hold on a second.

249
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,165
Miss, I really, really lickyou.

250
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,607
Ah! What did he mean?

251
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,405
Like you.

252
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:32,876
I didn't mean to say that.
And I just, um...

253
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,117
I just want to askyou, please,
if I can donate dinner.

254
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,163
He started to act very strange.

255
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:39,078
Or, well, buy you dinner.

256
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,083
- This isn't your chart.
- Whoa!

257
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:48,841
No. That's the, uh, this fellow
over here's. I think he left.

258
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,485
Have you already
had this shot?

259
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,206
Yeah, well, once already.

260
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,961
Well, I wanted-- I mean, I just--
can I askyou out?

261
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,924
No.

262
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,043
And hejust went wham!

263
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:06,126
Oh! What'd you do to him?

264
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,441
Poor guy.

265
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:13,596
Hey!

266
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:15,556
Hey!

267
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,002
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

268
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:20,681
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine. I feel great.

269
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,806
This isjust standard,
precautionary thing.

270
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:29,199
But, look, I got some, uh, genuine
French champagne from France.

271
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:32,120
And I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

272
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,323
Celebrate what?

273
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:38,036
Oh, I don't know.
You being my hero, for one.

274
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,120
Okay. Why not?

275
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:48,118
So I wanted to thankyou...

276
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:52,359
and I just wanted to put your mind
at ease about passing me...

277
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,961
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

278
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,676
I mean, I am a great flier.

279
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:04,239
And ifyou have a fault, which you
obviously don't, it's modesty.

280
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:07,922
No. If I have a fault,
it's candour.

281
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,283
You arejust so--

282
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:16,238
Corkjust got away from me.

283
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:27,407
God, it hurts!

284
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,842
It hurts something fierce.

285
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:32,202
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,517
- It's bleeding.
- God.

287
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:35,756
Oh.

288
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,157
- Lay still.
- I ruined everything. Oh, it hurts.

289
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,556
- It's cold!
- It'll stop the bleeding.

290
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:43,877
- I can't breathe.
- Lay still.

291
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,363
You are so beautiful,
it hurts.

292
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,437
It's your nose that hurts.

293
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:57,763
I think it's my heart.

294
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,763
And then I kissed him.

295
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:12,797
Evelyn, that's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

296
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:18,205
It's been the most romantic
four weeks and two days of my life.

297
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,005
I'm sojealous.

298
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:41,081
Hello, Lieutenant.
It's good to see you.

299
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,318
- You, too, Lieutenant.
- Pick a hand.

300
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:49,795
It's beautiful.

301
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,603
What's in your other hand?

302
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:55,564
Mine.

303
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,725
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

304
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,878
I want you to meet
my friends.

305
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,039
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra.

306
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,357
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

307
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:16,076
Would you happen
to have any friends?

308
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,203
Take your pick.

309
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,766
Hi.

310
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,518
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

311
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:49,360
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

312
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:53,360
that someone as sweet as you will
be there to nurse me back to health.

313
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,722
Good, but we're not
in the waryet.

314
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,200
Okay. That was a bad line.

315
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,562
Hi.

316
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:03,036
I'm-- I'm Red.

317
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:08,121
Red S-S-Strange.

318
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,675
- Your last name's Strange?
- Yeah, she's all yours, soldier.

319
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,156
No. It's-- It's Winkle.

320
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,405
Red is such a ladies' man.

321
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:20,445
- Do you always stutter?
- No. Only when I'm--

322
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,481
She's totally buying it.

323
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,239
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

324
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:26,885
Why can't I get
something like that?

325
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,600
- Hello.
- Hi.

326
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:41,885
Danny seems kind ofshy
around the girls.

327
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,480
It's not that he's shy.

328
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:47,116
He'sjust a little unsure
of himself, you know.

329
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,038
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

330
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:52,722
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

331
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,367
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

332
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:58,245
You know, my right hand.

333
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,763
Which, at the moment,
is a long way south of my waist.

334
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:06,006
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

336
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:07,964
Yeah, I guess you did.

337
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,446
Excuse me.

338
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:25,682
You and me,
we got to talk.

339
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:29,203
So the rumour is the navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

340
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,118
Well, won't be so bad.

341
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,324
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

342
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,204
You'll get a suntan.

343
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:39,085
So maybe the army
will post you guys there too.

344
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:43,001
You are
a super special woman.

345
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,486
And, and, well--

346
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,524
Well, they're training me
to be a big bad warrior...

347
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,963
and, well--

348
00:21:55,127 --> 00:22:00,485
So I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow or--

349
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:02,558
or any day after that,
you know?

350
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,956
So...

351
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:09,325
God, we need to make tonight
super special.

352
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,318
Why are you crying?

353
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:14,638
I guess it's the thought that I might
not ever get to see you again.

354
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:17,560
Dry your eyes, toots.
Tonight you're mine.

355
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:19,717
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

356
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:23,117
I just want to be
alone with you.

357
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,802
Well, how does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

358
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,198
Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

359
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:33,800
Ofcourse
I'm a bad influence.

360
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,684
Let's see ifwe can
commandeer this vessel...

361
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,678
'cause we're officers
ofthe U.S. government.

362
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,598
Not for long, we won't be.

363
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,198
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

364
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,845
Would you like that?

365
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:57,966
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the Grand Salon.

366
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:02,199
No one's talking about war.
They'rejust dancing to Cole Porter.

367
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,357
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

368
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,404
- Come on. There you go. All aboard.
- You're out ofyour mind.

369
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:14,478
Yeah. Careful now.
Here, sit down.

370
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:17,636
Now, let's see here.

371
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,476
There we go.

372
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,365
See, this is as close
as I could get you to your ship.

373
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,677
So at least I tried, right?

374
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:33,766
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

375
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,280
Yeah, it is.

376
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,720
God, you're pretty.

377
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,638
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

378
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:05,085
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

379
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,681
No. I guess you're right.

380
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,643
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

381
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,287
- Yeah, are you?
- That was not part ofthe date.

382
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:34,125
- Watch your step.
- Oh, thankyou.

383
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,677
- Evelyn!
- Guys, come up! Come on--

384
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:41,640
Come up!
We're in 32 1 .

385
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:43,604
There's something
I got to tell you.

386
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:45,564
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

387
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,638
I've seen your medical chart.

388
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:57,604
This can't be good,
or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

389
00:24:57,687 --> 00:25:01,600
Yeah. I got to go away.

390
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,917
We're all going away.

391
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,804
Yeah...

392
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:09,277
but I'm going to the war
tomorrow.

393
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,278
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

394
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:16,997
It's an outfit the British started
for American pilots.

395
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:20,523
I don't understand.

396
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:23,167
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they orderyou to go?

397
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:27,603
They didn't order me.
I volunteered.

398
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:37,718
But I passed you.
I let you through.

399
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:40,924
And now you volunteer for the most
dangerous place you could go?

400
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:45,364
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

401
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,802
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

402
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:51,243
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

403
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:55,960
Meeting you.

404
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,805
I love you.

405
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:04,878
I love you so much.

406
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,278
Let's go inside.

407
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:20,724
All right. Wait a minute.
I just-- I can't do this.

408
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:24,516
Thisjust-- It's not right.
I'm sorry. I just--

409
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,757
See, I can't do this.
I mean, l--

410
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,520
I mean, I can.
I-- I want to.

411
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:31,484
I'm not trying
to be noble, you know.

412
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,842
Or not saying
I know what would happen.

413
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,361
Orjust--
I need to stop talking.

414
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:39,405
I just-- I just don't want it-- I just
don't want it to be like everybody else.

415
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:43,321
I don't want you to have anything
about tonight that you'll regret.

416
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:46,444
I mean, it's been
the most incredible night of my life...

417
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,643
and I don't want
to ruin that.

418
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,558
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

419
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:57,801
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

420
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:01,438
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

421
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:04,678
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

422
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:09,045
I want to know that the best part
of my life is still ahead of me.

423
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:11,640
Look.

424
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:14,161
Don't--

425
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:17,205
Could you
not come see me off?

426
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:20,677
Because saying goodbye to you
once is hard enough.

427
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:25,958
Here.

428
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:32,161
- Take this.
- You think it looks good on me?

429
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:38,763
I will come back.

430
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,679
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

431
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:18,565
- Yeah, I did.
- Why are you looking for her then?

432
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:21,286
It's my test.

433
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,323
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

434
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:25,125
then l--
I know she loves me.

435
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:27,801
All aboard!
Track 57!

436
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:36,115
If, uh, anything
happens to me...

437
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:40,405
I want you to be
the one to tell her, all right?

438
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,557
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

439
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:58,242
- See you when I get back.
- Yeah.

440
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:03,765
Good hunting, Rafe.

441
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:28,522
Evelyn! Evelyn!

442
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:30,516
Evelyn!

443
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:38,522
Evelyn! Evelyn! Hey!

444
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,317
She loves me.

445
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:55,483
The German Luftwaffe relentlessly
bombards downtown London...

446
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:58,798
while Churchill'sRoyaIAirForce
is in a deadlystruggle...

447
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,845
to maintain control
ofthe British skies.

448
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,482
This is a real mess.

449
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,842
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

450
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:33,843
Good. We'll get you settled
into your quarters...

451
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:37,044
and then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

452
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,563
Yes, sir, well, ify'all are patching up
bullet holes right here on the runway...

453
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:43,036
maybe we ought to skip housekeeping
and get me right into an aeroplane.

454
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:46,119
Two didn't come back, sir.
We counted only eleven.

455
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:56,845
Are all Yanks as anxious as you
to get themselves killed, Pilot Officer?

456
00:30:56,927 --> 00:30:59,646
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

457
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,960
This is yours.

458
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:10,120
Good chap.

459
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:13,165
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

460
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:28,399
Please be seated,
gentlemen.

461
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,762
I'm afraid
I'm in a bad mood.

462
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:38,964
Churchill and Stalin are asking me
what I'm asking you.

463
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:43,723
How long is America going
to pretend the world is not at war?

464
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,446
We've increased food and oil supply
shipments to them, Mr President...

465
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:47,676
and as far as I know--

466
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:52,716
What they really need are tanks, planes,
bullets, bombs and men to fight.

467
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:58,165
But our people think Hitler and
his Nazi thugs are Europe's problem.

468
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,720
We have to do more.

469
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:05,402
Send the Brits and Russians more of
our ships and anti-aircraft weapons.

470
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,284
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?

471
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,005
What choice do we have?

472
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:13,558
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

473
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,006
This is so exciting.

474
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:23,157
You know, there's about
a hundred ships on Pearl.

475
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:24,919
And how many sailors per ship?

476
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:26,918
It depends. There's more
on a battleship than a sub.

477
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,601
But say, on average, 2,000?

478
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:32,804
Yeah, but then there's the fliers,
the marines, the base personnel.

479
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,923
I'm still working on the sailors.

480
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,520
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favour.

481
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,325
Yeah, like 4,000 to 1 .

482
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:39,806
It's paradise.

483
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:45,084
See you on the beach, boys!
We're in Hawaii!

484
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:56,245
Hey, you know, you're not
supposed to be paintin' titties
on the side of my aeroplanes.

485
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,046
And ifyou do,
don't make 'em lopsided.

486
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:01,561
- They were lopsided, Earl.
- Look, it says right here.

487
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:05,720
"Never ride waves amongst rocks
or submerged pilings."

488
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,206
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.

489
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:10,245
Well, how you gonna know they're
submerged ifthey're submerged?

490
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:12,795
Hey, Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?

491
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,798
He's trying to fix
this surfboard thing of his.

492
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,605
He keeps taking chunks off his nose
on the rocks.

493
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,201
I thought I'd come in on my day off,
work on my new invention--

494
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,926
the Gooz cruise fin.

495
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,281
I'm gonna be a rich fella.

496
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,483
Every surfboard in the nation's
gonna need one.

497
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,080
Yeah?
You're gonna need a broom.

498
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:29,556
Oh. Check out
these new recruits.

499
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,886
- Hi.
- Aloha.

500
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:37,197
Y'all pilots?

501
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:39,278
We're working on it.

502
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,198
There's a lot ofswitches
and stuff.

503
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,922
- Pride ofthe Pacific.
- Who are you?

504
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:50,005
Terrors ofthe Skies.

505
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:55,240
- Welcome, ladies.
- Hi.

506
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,841
I have to deal with
Coastie's sunburnt rump...

507
00:34:57,927 --> 00:34:59,997
before I can show you around.

508
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,598
Dear Evelyn...

509
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,155
it's different than I thought
it would be here.

510
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:10,919
It's cold.

511
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:15,523
So cold it goes deep
into your bones.

512
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:18,599
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

513
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:20,757
That is to think ofyou.

514
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:23,236
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

515
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:28,682
It's not easy making friends.

516
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:32,123
Two days ago, I had a beer
with a couple ofthe RAF pilots.

517
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:34,118
Yesterday,
both ofthem got killed.

518
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,319
Dear Rafe...

519
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:51,046
I miss you so much.

520
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:54,722
It's so strange to be
halfa world away from you.

521
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:57,401
I'm right on his tail!

522
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:04,720
Got one!

523
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,082
Every night I look at the sunset...

524
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:12,126
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...

525
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:15,165
and send it
from my heart to yours.

526
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,517
Family?

527
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:25,484
Girl, sir.

528
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:27,797
The girl.

529
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:33,395
A lot of people frown on the Yanks
for not being in this waryet.

530
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:35,205
I'd just like to say...

531
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:38,085
ifthere are many more
back home like you...

532
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:41,239
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

533
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,564
Atten-hut!

534
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,638
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...

535
00:36:50,727 --> 00:36:52,763
commander-in-chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

536
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:54,326
Sharp presentation, Captain.

537
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,999
Thankyou, Admiral Kimmel.

538
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,555
For four months now,
Washington's been blowing pink smoke...

539
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:00,239
about the threat fromJapan.

540
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:03,478
Could make us lose our fighting edge.
I'm determined not to let that happen.

541
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:11,161
With your permission,
Captain.

542
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:14,080
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.

543
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,439
I'm supposed to keep this fleet
battle-ready to take on theJapanese...

544
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:23,836
cover halfthe damn globe.

545
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,760
Now they want me to transfer
another 1 2 destroyers to the Atlantic.

546
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,326
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?

547
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,204
They feel Europe
is the greater danger, Admiral.

548
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:33,120
I'm assuming these risk assessments
include Hawaii.

549
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:36,199
Well, Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack...

550
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,720
and we're surrounded by sub nets.

551
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,684
All we have to worry about here
is sabotage...

552
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:42,964
so we bunched our planes together
to make them easier to protect.

553
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:45,083
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

554
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,001
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

555
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:52,966
The smart enemy hits you exactly
where you thinkyou're safe.

556
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:15,043
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrical systems, sir...

557
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:16,958
but the oil hoses
still need attention.

558
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:19,402
-Just crank it, lan!
- God speed you, sir.

559
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:32,202
Red section, take the bombers.
Blue section, look out for fighters.

560
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,879
Bombers dead ahead.

561
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,037
Let's drop in on 'em
and give 'em a reception.

562
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,322
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.

563
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:43,716
- Go right at the lead bomber.
- Following you, Red One.

564
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:52,562
Good hit! Good hit!

565
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,318
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

566
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:04,355
I have the middle bomber.

567
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:08,162
Hammer down!

568
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,441
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.

569
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:17,879
I got two M.E.'s dead ahead.

570
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:25,799
I'm on him. I'm on his tail.
Hammer down.

571
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,324
I got one ofthem!

572
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:42,715
I got another one.

573
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,037
Red One, you got fighters
all overyour tail!

574
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:47,686
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!

575
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,645
Red One, get out ofthere.
Pull up! Pull up!

576
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:01,997
I got an oil leak!

577
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:06,599
Can't see a damn thing!

578
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:11,367
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!

579
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:12,880
I can't bail out!

580
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:23,720
He's on my tail, Red Two.

581
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,278
I'm hit! I'm hit!

582
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:38,878
Mayday! Mayday!

583
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,398
Oh, my God.

584
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:01,241
- I'm no good at church.
- What do you mean, sweetie?

585
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:04,558
Well, whenever I'm up there
getting my slate wiped clean...

586
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,400
I can't help but think of how
I'm gonna dirty it up again.

587
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,445
- This from a virgin.
- I've got to inventory supplies.

588
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:14,486
Oh! Kill me now.
Could you be any more boring?

589
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,398
Don't bother.
Sundays she writes Rafe.

590
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:18,842
Ten pages
instead ofthe usual five.

591
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:21,839
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

592
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:25,926
Hey, sweetheart.

593
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:28,356
She hates me.

594
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:33,162
- Good to see you, Red.
- Sure good to see you, too, Betty.

595
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:36,045
What are you doing?
You wanna come for a ride? Come on.

596
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,277
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

597
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:50,921
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

598
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,283
You hit pretty hard
for a cook.

599
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:58,477
All right, Walker, who you got?
Come on. Fight's almost over.

600
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:01,400
- I'll take the cook.
- Why? You don't like money?

601
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:05,845
Come on!
Get out there now!

602
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:11,522
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

603
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:15,607
Against the mechanic?
That guy craps rivets.

604
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:18,724
How's it feel up from that dark, oily
engine room? Sunlight botherin' you?

605
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:21,322
Ow.

606
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,324
Man, he's getting
all busted up in there!

607
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:26,520
Move! Move!

608
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:31,039
Come here. We gotta talk.
Get down here.

609
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:34,164
- He can't hurt us.
- He can hurt us.

610
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:37,205
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

611
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:39,596
That's a scratch.
You see this here?

612
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:43,043
This here's the hard-earned greenbacks
ofevery pot-scrubbin', dish-washin'
chop in this here fleet.

613
00:43:43,127 --> 00:43:47,040
Now, ifwe don't win, the Teeny here
has to find himselfanother battleship.

614
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,004
'Cause there's no way I'm going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.

615
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,760
Don't worry about the money.

616
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:54,839
I'm gonna send that smug
engine-fixin' snipe...

617
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,918
back below decks
where he belong.

618
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,998
Come on, man! We the man!
You the man!

619
00:43:59,087 --> 00:44:01,476
He slapped your mama, remember?
Be a son ofa bitch!

620
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:11,355
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!

621
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:26,322
That's enough.
That's enough.

622
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:31,997
Oh! Where's my money?

623
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,315
Nah. Fight's rigged.

624
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,682
We're rich!

625
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:39,322
How'd you get this?

626
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:41,602
Boxing.

627
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:43,040
Did you win?

628
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:44,845
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,556
What do you get
for winning?

630
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:50,285
Respect.

631
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:58,959
So why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

632
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:03,325
I left my mama in Texas and
joined the navy to see the world...

633
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:05,398
become a man.

634
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:08,160
They made me a cook.

635
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:12,445
Not even that. I, uh,
clean up after other sailors eat.

636
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:17,644
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

637
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:20,278
Well, let's hope
you never have to.

638
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:22,642
Yes, ma'am.

639
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:24,479
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.

640
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,125
You, too, ma'am.

641
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,797
You know,
he taught me to fly.

642
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:13,355
I always knew that no matter
what kind oftrouble I got into...

643
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:15,836
I'd never be in it alone.

644
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:18,487
He'd be there with me.

645
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:23,598
Up there, he was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

646
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:29,482
He told me you were
a great flier.

647
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:33,242
It was the same night he told me
he volunteered to go to England.

648
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:37,807
Volunteered?

649
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:39,957
He--

650
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,481
He told me
he'd been assigned.

651
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:49,245
He was always
trying to protect me.

652
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:56,877
But you know what? I look at myself
in the mirror in this uniform...

653
00:46:56,967 --> 00:47:00,596
and I still don't know
who I am.

654
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:03,485
I look like a hero...

655
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:06,001
but I don't feel like it.

656
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,924
Rafe...

657
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:14,283
he always looked the part,
didn't he?

658
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:16,676
He couldn't wait to be one.

659
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,678
To Rafe McCawley.

660
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:45,007
The best pilot...

661
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:48,602
and the best friend
I ever knew...

662
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:50,200
or ever will know.

663
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:55,880
To Rafe.

664
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:00,082
Look at this. Look at this.

665
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:03,079
TheJapanese are flooding
the Pacific with radio traffic.

666
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:05,806
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to Southeast Asia.

667
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:07,400
There's no logical pattern
in it, Captain.

668
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,842
No, there's--
There's always logic.

669
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:11,565
They know we read their mail.

670
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:15,686
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

671
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:17,439
I'm not buying it.

672
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:20,485
Something, something--
Something's up.

673
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:24,082
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

674
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,198
Evelyn, um, I signed for
these letters foryou today.

675
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:44,682
They're from England.

676
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,359
They're from Rafe.

677
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:48,324
I'm sorry, Ev.

678
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:51,001
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

679
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:06,401
- Hurry up!
- Show time, boys! Come on!

680
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,602
America stillawaitsJapan's response
topeaceproposals.

681
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:16,155
AmbassadorNomura
arrives in Washington...

682
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:20,035
in what couldhopefullyguarantee
continuedpeace in the Pacific.

683
00:50:20,127 --> 00:50:22,277
On the British front.
Churchilldeclares...

684
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:25,325
"Give us the tools.
and we willfinish thejob. "

685
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:29,279
The RAFhasfought bravely...

686
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:33,406
against Hitler'sambition
to rule theskies overthe Channel.

687
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:37,877
Victorydoesnot come
withoutsacrifice.

688
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:41,919
- Evelyn!
- Danny.

689
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:44,475
- Hey.
- Some comedy, huh?

690
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:49,519
- Yeah.
- It's been awhile.

691
00:50:49,607 --> 00:50:51,996
Yeah, I've been logging
a lot offlight hours.

692
00:50:52,087 --> 00:50:54,806
I kinda been
avoiding you too.

693
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,525
Yeah.

694
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:58,723
- Look--
- Do you--

695
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:02,117
- Do you want to?
- Sure, yeah.

696
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:05,517
I remember this one time
when I was like seven years old.

697
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,757
I was always building
these gadgets and things.

698
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:09,758
He told me he wanted me
to build him some wings...

699
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,838
so that he could fly like
his daddy, dusting crops.

700
00:51:11,927 --> 00:51:14,760
I told him you can't fly without
some kind ofengine, right?

701
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:16,803
But he wouldn't listen.
You know, he told me...

702
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:18,923
"Danny, never mind all that.
Just build 'em anyway."

703
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:21,043
So I did.

704
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:24,642
And I'm up there, strapping
these big ol' wings on his back...

705
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:28,879
that we made from paper and glue
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.

706
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,561
He looked so stupid, you know?
And I told him...

707
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:34,002
"You can'tjump off
the barn in these."

708
00:51:34,087 --> 00:51:35,281
And bam!

709
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:37,756
He busted his leg
on the backhoe.

710
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:44,206
God, I miss him.

711
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:49,566
Yeah, but don't you think that Rafe
wasn't back up there the next day...

712
00:51:49,647 --> 00:51:50,682
cast and everything...

713
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:54,316
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.

714
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:57,683
Wow. Check this out.
Crossroads to the Pacific.

715
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:02,283
Tahiti, 1 ,700 miles.
All right! Okay.

716
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,964
Say, Betty.

717
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,439
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?

718
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:17,563
- You've gotta stand up, please.
- What do you mean, get up?

719
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:22,081
Just stand up.
Stand up here.

720
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,486
Oh!

721
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,206
- Betty--
- Red, come on!

722
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:29,642
We got a dinner reservation.

723
00:52:32,287 --> 00:52:34,960
Can I get a minute?

724
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:36,321
What's the matter,
you sick?

725
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:39,639
Can a guy propose?

726
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:43,118
Oh! Thankyou!

727
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:47,564
Am I talking too much?
Sometimes I do that. I'm sorry.

728
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:52,326
Hold up. Look at this.

729
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:53,886
Hello.

730
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:57,558
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay. Hey!

731
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,442
I guess I should go.

732
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,166
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again, all right?

733
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:07,886
- I had a good time.
- Yeah, me too.

734
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:12,643
- Do you want me to walkyou home?
- No, I'll be fine.

735
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:14,524
No. Ofcourse.

736
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,677
- Good night, Danny.
- Good night.

737
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:31,238
I wasjust wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

738
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:35,161
get a cup ofcoffee
or a piece of pie.

739
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:37,886
What am I doing?

740
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:39,161
Okay.

741
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,721
Oh! You were asleep.
I'm sorry.

742
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:46,445
Danny?

743
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:47,721
Is something wrong?

744
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,798
No! There's nothing wrong.
There's no problem. Hi.

745
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:52,242
It'sjust Danny.

746
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:56,286
I just-- You--
You forgot this.

747
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,205
Oh.

748
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:04,202
Thanks. It was good ofyou to take
the trouble to drop it over now.

749
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,847
I-- I thought you might need it,
you know...

750
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:09,361
uh, maybe tomorrow morning.

751
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:12,280
If, uh-- I mean, not that
you wear this to work, but--

752
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,198
No. It's a hanky.

753
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,284
Right, right. Yeah.

754
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:25,683
Listen, I was thinking
maybe, uh, I could come by
some time or give you call--

755
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:28,235
If I gave you a call,
could I come by some time?

756
00:54:30,087 --> 00:54:32,965
Once, maybe,
ifyou're not busy?

757
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:35,241
Yeah, maybe.

758
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:37,682
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

759
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:38,882
Okay, all right.

760
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:42,198
- Thanks. Good night.
- Goodbye. Good night. Good night.

761
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:44,403
You are such an idiot.

762
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:52,355
- Did you have fun last night?
- It wasn't how it looked.

763
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:56,200
And if it was, it'd be all right.
It's been months. It's time to move on.

764
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:59,515
- I am moving on.
- Ev, don't lie.

765
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:01,995
All I know is I hearyou crying
when you think I'm asleep.

766
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:05,554
When my dad left, I was too much
for my mom to handle...

767
00:55:05,646 --> 00:55:08,399
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

768
00:55:08,486 --> 00:55:12,195
I thought my life was over, but you
don't know where it's all going to lead.

769
00:55:12,286 --> 00:55:16,040
If I hadn't have run away and lied
about my age and enlisted in the navy...

770
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:20,438
I-- I wouldn't have met Red,
and-- now he's my fianc.

771
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,516
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.

772
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:26,642
- It's only been 1 2 hours.
- Oh, Betty.

773
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:28,637
Uh, Little Betty beat us all
to the post.

774
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:32,275
And this is ward three.
As you can see, no patients.

775
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:34,322
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on. I'll show you the bar.

776
00:55:34,406 --> 00:55:36,397
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

777
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:39,398
- Come on. Excuse me, ladies.
- Hi!

778
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:44,442
We're gonna wait two years until
I'm 1 9 and Red can buy me a ring.

779
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:50,282
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you
so you would be okay...

780
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:53,358
so you can move on.

781
00:55:53,446 --> 00:55:56,279
You gotta go on living, Ev.

782
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:04,124
Red!

783
00:56:04,206 --> 00:56:06,037
Oh! Sorry.

784
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:24,035
Bye, Rafe.

785
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:28,242
TheJapanese fleet is missing.

786
00:56:28,326 --> 00:56:30,681
They're operating
under radio silence.

787
00:56:31,966 --> 00:56:35,515
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28.

788
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:41,955
Well, we're sending scout planes in
wider vectors all over the Pacific...

789
00:56:42,046 --> 00:56:43,638
but they get nothing.

790
00:56:43,726 --> 00:56:45,796
Now, they could be
anywhere in here.

791
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:50,801
I don't understand how two whole
carrier divisions can just disappear.

792
00:56:56,726 --> 00:56:58,159
Clear!

793
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:08,685
Oh, we're all over the page.

794
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:10,484
We got one walleyed
and one pigeon-toed.

795
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:13,126
- Anthony, tap in number six.
- All right.

796
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:14,434
- Gooz?
- Yeah?

797
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:16,323
- Tap in number three.
- All right.

798
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:18,636
Hey, we got a visitor.

799
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,116
Oh, that ain't no
navy issue uniform, eh?

800
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:26,199
- Danny, it's Evelyn.
-Jesus.

801
00:57:26,286 --> 00:57:29,801
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

802
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:32,275
No.

803
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,879
I think I'm falling for her.

804
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:37,800
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.

805
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:41,003
I didn't want this to happen.
Itjust kind ofdid. Can't help it.

806
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,554
Well, Danny, she's got to be
with somebody. It might as well be you.

807
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:46,558
You're telling me
ifyou were dead, and you saw
your best buddy doing your girl...

808
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:48,716
you wouldn't come back and
beat the livin' crap out of him?

809
00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:51,718
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

810
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:54,366
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

811
00:57:54,446 --> 00:57:56,277
I got a girlfriend.

812
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:03,963
That's great.
Come on, fellas. Let's split.

813
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:07,163
Danny, whatever happens now is
just about you and her.

814
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:09,885
You got to try
and forget about Rafe.

815
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:11,285
Be careful, all right?

816
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:14,278
Ladies cloud the mind.

817
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:17,242
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

818
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:20,957
Hey, Danny.

819
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:25,602
Where's everybody going?

820
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:27,244
Just being discreet.

821
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:29,681
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

822
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:32,280
No, no.

823
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:34,038
Right.

824
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:37,321
Well, maybe--
maybe a little, yeah.

825
00:58:38,406 --> 00:58:41,398
Well, people in this outfit have way
too much time on their hands.

826
00:58:41,486 --> 00:58:42,714
Oh, yeah.

827
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:45,274
I just hope they don't think
there's been something going on
between us. That's all.

828
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:48,164
Oh, no, I mean, no. I mean,
that would be embarrassing, right?

829
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:50,565
I forgot my wrenches.

830
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:53,444
- It'd definitely be embarrassing.
- Yeah.

831
00:58:53,526 --> 00:58:58,725
- Hi. Forgot my wrenches.
- Hey. He really doesn't have to leave.

832
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:00,205
No.

833
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,720
I, uh-- I'm just going out
with the girls, so--

834
00:59:05,366 --> 00:59:08,119
- Guess I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

835
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:10,800
- All right.
- Yeah. All right. I'll see you around.

836
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:14,237
Shit.

837
00:59:14,326 --> 00:59:16,282
Evelyn?

838
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:18,322
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

839
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:22,563
- Ofcourse.
- Well, from the air?

840
00:59:26,406 --> 00:59:28,795
You know, I could get kicked out
ofthe military for this.

841
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:31,446
- Really?
- Yes. Stay down.

842
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,400
The Hawaiians call
this harbour WaiMomi.

843
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:55,842
- It means "water of pearls."
- It's so beautiful.

844
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,520
My dad took me up
a couple oftimes.

845
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:01,484
Just don't do what he did.
What do you call it? When you flip over?

846
01:00:01,566 --> 01:00:03,875
- A barrel roll?
- Yeah.

847
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,161
Oh.

848
01:00:13,286 --> 01:00:15,197
Oh!

849
01:00:16,206 --> 01:00:17,958
Oh, my God.

850
01:00:18,046 --> 01:00:20,480
- What do you think?
- I like that.

851
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,357
- Hey, that plane was supposed...
- Duck.

852
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:33,959
to be back here an hour ago.

853
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:36,606
Quick. Hide in
the parachute hangar.

854
01:01:13,366 --> 01:01:15,596
My heart is pounding.

855
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:03,475
Danny, last night--

856
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:05,602
No, that's terrible.

857
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:09,561
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

858
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:13,084
- Sir. Evelyn!
- Danny!

859
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,316
Hey. Hi.

860
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,682
Hi.

861
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:22,440
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

862
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:23,959
I had to see ya.

863
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:27,402
Last night was crazy, I know,
but I'm not sorry.

864
01:02:27,486 --> 01:02:30,637
Are you?

865
01:02:30,726 --> 01:02:33,843
I don't know.

866
01:02:33,926 --> 01:02:37,521
Danny, I had a wonderful time
last night. I--

867
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:40,074
- It'sjust all too fast.
- Listen, Evelyn.

868
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:43,044
I wasjust down at the beach this
morning, and I watched the sun rise...

869
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,594
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different...

870
01:02:47,006 --> 01:02:49,156
that this was the start
ofsomething new...

871
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:52,044
in this place,
in this moment...

872
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:55,243
and I don't care
what anybody else says, you know?

873
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:58,794
How can I not feel this way?

874
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:02,639
I kind of like ya.

875
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:06,806
Oh, you do?

876
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,398
You have your tie on crooked.

877
01:03:15,446 --> 01:03:18,165
Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

878
01:03:19,806 --> 01:03:22,081
Everything's gonna be all right.

879
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:34,444
Do you have any air tours
going through the valley of Oahu?

880
01:03:35,526 --> 01:03:38,120
You do?

881
01:03:48,726 --> 01:03:51,718
Aloha. This is KGMB
in Honolulu...

882
01:03:51,806 --> 01:03:54,764
on anotherbeautifulfallday
here inparadise.

883
01:03:58,486 --> 01:03:59,839
We have enough information.

884
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:04,797
We are returning home.

885
01:04:32,526 --> 01:04:35,279
Do you ever wonder if
this war's gonna catch up with us?

886
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,603
Not a whole lot.

887
01:04:39,486 --> 01:04:42,637
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.

888
01:04:44,406 --> 01:04:47,603
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these.

889
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:50,883
'Cause I have no idea how I'm gonna
get this car out ofthe sand.

890
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:52,877
Evelyn, can you please
come out ofthe bathroom?

891
01:04:52,966 --> 01:04:55,400
You've been there for an hour.
Evelyn!

892
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:57,875
What are you trying to do?
Look like me?

893
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:02,960
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

894
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:06,800
What's the matter? No, you--

895
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:08,683
They call it the Vacant Sea.

896
01:05:08,766 --> 01:05:10,677
None ofthe major sea lanes
go through it...

897
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:14,725
and you could bury the entire land mass
ofAsia there, and nobody would know.

898
01:05:14,806 --> 01:05:18,401
From there,
they could attack anywhere.

899
01:05:18,486 --> 01:05:21,523
Our last signals intercept indicate
that theJapanese task force...

900
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:24,359
is heading south, toward
the Philippines or Southeast Asia.

901
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:26,641
But Captain Thurman
of Naval lntelligence here...

902
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:29,194
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

903
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:32,483
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us
where it'll hurt us the most--

904
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:33,885
Pearl Harbor.

905
01:05:33,966 --> 01:05:36,241
That's over 4,000 nautical miles
fromJapan.

906
01:05:36,326 --> 01:05:39,716
To Pearl, that's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

907
01:05:41,886 --> 01:05:43,842
Your theory--
It's based on what?

908
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:45,837
Well, it's what I would do.

909
01:05:45,926 --> 01:05:48,998
It's not exactly hard evidence,
Captain Thurman.

910
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:51,520
Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence,
we'd already be at war.

911
01:05:51,606 --> 01:05:54,518
Sir, we can read their diplomatic
codes faster than they can type them.

912
01:05:54,606 --> 01:05:57,882
But Captain Thurman's cryptology team is
still trying to crack the naval codes.

913
01:05:57,966 --> 01:06:00,719
The intercepts have missing words
and garbled lines.

914
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:02,717
So to explain the decrypts...

915
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:05,479
we have to try to interpret
what we think they're trying to do.

916
01:06:05,566 --> 01:06:08,524
Interpret? You mean, guess.

917
01:06:08,606 --> 01:06:11,916
They use their
informed intuition, sir.

918
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:14,759
We guess. It's like
playing chess in the dark.

919
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:18,521
Any rumour, troop movement, ship
movement, spine tingle, goosebump...

920
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,597
we pay attention to it.

921
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:22,756
When I was in the Asiatic fleet,
the locals used to try to...

922
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:25,076
get outside ofa problem
to try to see the inside.

923
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,645
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

924
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,205
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

925
01:06:28,286 --> 01:06:31,676
A blow to Pearl would devastate the
Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.

926
01:06:31,766 --> 01:06:34,803
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

927
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:36,877
at the cost
of millions ofdollars...

928
01:06:36,966 --> 01:06:40,163
based on this spine-tingling
feeling ofyours?

929
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:43,921
No, sir. I understand myjob
is to gather and interpret material.

930
01:06:44,006 --> 01:06:47,362
Making difficult decisions
based on incomplete information...

931
01:06:47,446 --> 01:06:52,566
from my limited decoding ability
is yourjob, sir.

932
01:06:52,646 --> 01:06:56,844
Then break the damn naval code, Captain,
so I can make a better decision.

933
01:06:56,926 --> 01:06:59,759
Aye, sir. We are trying.

934
01:07:16,246 --> 01:07:18,885
I wonder ifwe shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

935
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:27,395
In case the optimism
ofthe HonoluluAdvertiser...

936
01:07:27,486 --> 01:07:29,920
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

937
01:07:30,006 --> 01:07:32,964
what are General Short and the army
going to do about protecting my ships?

938
01:07:33,046 --> 01:07:35,435
Within a ten-mile radius
ofyour harbour...

939
01:07:35,526 --> 01:07:37,482
we have fighter planes
here at Wheeler...

940
01:07:37,566 --> 01:07:39,522
bombers at Hickam
and a training strip at Haleiwa.

941
01:07:49,446 --> 01:07:53,837
We've recently established
a radar station here that
can detect planes 1 25 miles out.

942
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:56,076
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

943
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:58,919
I've seen these
new radar screens, Major.

944
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:02,078
There's no way oftelling
whether they're ours, theirs
or a flock ofdamn birds.

945
01:08:04,726 --> 01:08:07,798
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo
to somewhere close by Pearl.

946
01:08:07,886 --> 01:08:10,719
There's a call from Tokyo.
They say they don't know you.

947
01:08:12,606 --> 01:08:14,642
Hello?

948
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:25,078
It's a local dentist. He can see
Pearl Harbor from his office.

949
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:27,122
"Are there many sailors around?"

950
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:36,039
Uh, the dentist says that
the flat ships are not in port.

951
01:08:36,126 --> 01:08:38,720
They're talking about the weather.

952
01:08:38,806 --> 01:08:40,842
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

953
01:08:40,926 --> 01:08:42,564
Hello?

954
01:08:42,646 --> 01:08:44,682
Hello?

955
01:08:44,766 --> 01:08:46,404
Hello?

956
01:08:47,366 --> 01:08:48,685
That was a strange call.

957
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:52,564
Admiral, may I speak to you
in private?

958
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,479
Why would a spy use a phone?

959
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:57,124
They know we tap
all international lines.

960
01:08:57,206 --> 01:08:59,117
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

961
01:08:59,206 --> 01:09:01,117
It sounds like someone inJapan
is sneaking around...

962
01:09:01,206 --> 01:09:03,117
asking a local citizen
the location ofour carriers.

963
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,401
Well, that makes me
feel all warm inside.

964
01:09:05,486 --> 01:09:08,159
Get the FBI on it immediately.

965
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:10,396
Have we found
the goddamJapanese fleet yet?

966
01:09:10,486 --> 01:09:12,875
No, Admiral, the bases
are looking all over the Pacific.

967
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:14,718
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head right now.

968
01:09:14,806 --> 01:09:16,797
We wouldn't know a thing about it.

969
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,036
Get on it.

970
01:09:51,046 --> 01:09:53,002
I'm alive.

971
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:55,077
This is the first
I could get word out.

972
01:10:52,886 --> 01:10:55,161
I told you I'd come back.

973
01:10:58,086 --> 01:11:00,122
Here. Sit down.
Sit down. Come here.

974
01:11:00,206 --> 01:11:02,595
It's okay.

975
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:05,757
It's all right.

976
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:10,245
- You're real.
- Yeah.

977
01:11:11,446 --> 01:11:14,518
- I wished for this every day.
- I know. Me too.

978
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:17,074
Every second, so did l.

979
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:21,079
I thought you were dead. They--
They said you were shot down in the sea.

980
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:23,236
Yeah, I was.

981
01:11:23,326 --> 01:11:26,159
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

982
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:28,237
I missed you.

983
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:31,955
I got picked up by a--
a French fishing boat, and l--

984
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:34,480
I was in Occupied France.
I couldn't get word out.

985
01:11:34,566 --> 01:11:36,522
I'll tell you all about it.
I promise.

986
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:41,122
But I'm fine. I'm okay,
and I'm here now.

987
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:46,075
I just wanted to see you.
You're so beautiful.

988
01:11:59,246 --> 01:12:01,202
I love you.

989
01:12:01,286 --> 01:12:03,038
I love you.

990
01:12:06,246 --> 01:12:08,965
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

991
01:12:09,046 --> 01:12:11,002
Evelyn-- Evelyn, I'm back.

992
01:12:12,326 --> 01:12:15,398
It's okay.
I won't leave you again. I promise.

993
01:12:16,726 --> 01:12:19,604
Rafe, you died.

994
01:12:21,326 --> 01:12:22,725
So did l.

995
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:26,594
I know, but I'm-- I'm--
It's fine now. I'm back.

996
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:29,159
We're together.

997
01:12:35,486 --> 01:12:38,922
I mean, we are together, right?

998
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:43,563
I don't know where I am.

999
01:12:47,006 --> 01:12:48,564
Rafe.

1000
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:18,442
Rafe?

1001
01:13:20,966 --> 01:13:23,002
Stay away.

1002
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,997
Rafe!

1003
01:13:29,366 --> 01:13:32,563
This isRadio Honolulu.
playing thesweetest music...

1004
01:13:32,646 --> 01:13:35,718
on thesweetest island
in the Pacific.

1005
01:13:35,806 --> 01:13:38,161
It'sa beautifuIDecember6
with beautifulmusic...

1006
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:41,044
from the beautifulbeach
ofWaikiki.

1007
01:13:49,446 --> 01:13:52,165
- Rafe!
- Rafe!

1008
01:13:52,246 --> 01:13:53,918
Oh! God damn it.
There you go.

1009
01:13:54,006 --> 01:13:55,997
A real live ace!

1010
01:13:57,286 --> 01:13:59,800
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.'s.

1011
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:02,400
- And I got two smokers too.
They don't count them.
- Oh, sorry.

1012
01:14:02,486 --> 01:14:04,795
Ofcourse, I got shot down myself
before they could pin me.

1013
01:14:04,886 --> 01:14:07,764
You got back from behind enemy lines,
huh? What was that combat like?

1014
01:14:07,846 --> 01:14:10,519
- Were you scared?
- Hey! One at a time.

1015
01:14:10,606 --> 01:14:12,119
Oh, fine.

1016
01:14:12,206 --> 01:14:16,882
Well, them Luftwaffe boys can
fly pretty good. It's not like,
you know, training. They're, uh--

1017
01:14:20,846 --> 01:14:24,077
- Danny.
- You know, they're all
about tactics is what it is.

1018
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:25,884
You see, the Nazis, right?
They're faster than you are.

1019
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:28,036
So they'll disappear,
and they get up in the soup.

1020
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:31,402
They'll throw like
a roll or a hammerhead and
come around your high side, you know.

1021
01:14:31,486 --> 01:14:34,284
Shoot you from behind,
like some Americans will.

1022
01:14:39,246 --> 01:14:43,444
Hey, Gooz, you're
lookin' at a real live ace.

1023
01:14:43,526 --> 01:14:45,756
Well, let me give you
the shirt off my back.

1024
01:14:47,486 --> 01:14:50,284
- Aloha! There you go!
- I'll take it from you!

1025
01:14:50,366 --> 01:14:52,277
You all are having
a pretty good time out here.

1026
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:53,685
Hey, Rafe,
we got to talk, all right?

1027
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:56,519
Ain't got nothing
to talk about with you. Here.

1028
01:14:58,526 --> 01:15:01,120
Why don't you have a drink?

1029
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:03,356
I'll make a toast.

1030
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:05,402
To returnin' from the dead.

1031
01:15:05,486 --> 01:15:07,920
Wasn't all I expected,
but, well, that's life.

1032
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:11,881
And to-- to my best friend
and loyal buddy Danny...

1033
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:15,356
for keeping up the war effort
back here at home.

1034
01:15:15,446 --> 01:15:18,165
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.
- That was good.

1035
01:15:21,126 --> 01:15:23,162
You know, where I come from,
somebody makes a toast to you...

1036
01:15:23,246 --> 01:15:25,157
and you don't drink,
that's sayin' somethin'.

1037
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:29,246
All right, Rafe,
that's how it's gonna be.

1038
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,559
- To you.
- Hey, you guys need to spend
some time alone, I think.

1039
01:15:33,646 --> 01:15:35,602
Oh, hell, no, Red. Come on.

1040
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:38,120
What are you talking--
No, no, no. We're celebrating here.

1041
01:15:38,206 --> 01:15:40,162
Me over there fightin'.

1042
01:15:40,246 --> 01:15:42,157
Almost gettin' killed.

1043
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:46,080
My friend Danny back here,
looking after my interests for me.

1044
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,636
You all know Danny was
even good enough to look out for
my girl for me while I was gone.

1045
01:15:49,726 --> 01:15:52,365
We thought you were dead, Rafe,
and it gutted us both...

1046
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:55,006
and we werejust trying
to get on with our lives.

1047
01:15:55,086 --> 01:15:56,565
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

1048
01:15:56,646 --> 01:15:58,716
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.

1049
01:15:58,806 --> 01:16:01,639
Yeah, well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.

1050
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:06,200
You left her to fight
somebody else's war.

1051
01:16:06,286 --> 01:16:09,084
And you made damn sure
that I didn't go with ya,
and we thought that you were dead!

1052
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,396
I almost did die,
you little son ofa bitch.

1053
01:16:11,486 --> 01:16:13,522
Her face was the last thing
that went through my mind.

1054
01:16:13,606 --> 01:16:15,517
So don't stand there and tell me
to act like it's all right.

1055
01:16:15,606 --> 01:16:18,166
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.

1056
01:16:18,246 --> 01:16:20,806
I stayed, and you made sure ofthat,
and some things changed.

1057
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:23,719
- I hope you can get used to that.
- Oh, I have to get used to it.

1058
01:16:23,806 --> 01:16:26,001
- Yeah.
- All right.

1059
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:27,678
We'll see how
I can get used to it.

1060
01:16:29,806 --> 01:16:31,762
- Get used to that, boy.
- Hey!

1061
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:33,757
- And that's my left hand too.
- Hey, hey, hey!

1062
01:16:34,846 --> 01:16:36,802
Come on!

1063
01:16:40,606 --> 01:16:42,881
Melee at the Hula-la! Send MP's!

1064
01:16:46,286 --> 01:16:47,958
You called me a lousy friend?

1065
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:54,404
Shit!

1066
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:55,839
Come on!

1067
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:04,918
- Let's go get 'em!
- Move out!

1068
01:17:07,726 --> 01:17:10,479
Oh, they're gonna throw us
in the brig. Let's go.

1069
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:56,797
Oh, shit.

1070
01:17:58,686 --> 01:18:03,123
Rafe, you're
the only family I got.

1071
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:06,562
When you were gone, it was
the loneliest I'd ever been.

1072
01:18:06,646 --> 01:18:08,557
The same for her too.

1073
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:11,001
Oh, boy, now you're
really breaking my heart.

1074
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,156
Ifyou hadn't gone,
none ofthis would have happened.

1075
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:16,044
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.

1076
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:18,640
Damn it, Rafe.

1077
01:18:21,846 --> 01:18:24,918
I just know there's
got to be some way...

1078
01:18:25,006 --> 01:18:28,043
we can work
things out so that...

1079
01:18:28,126 --> 01:18:30,037
things can be right
between me and you.

1080
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,966
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.

1081
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:43,085
Revered father...

1082
01:18:47,086 --> 01:18:50,283
I go now to fulfi I
my mission and my destiny.

1083
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:55,599
I hope it is a destiny
that will bring honour to our family.

1084
01:18:55,686 --> 01:18:58,120
And if it requires my life...

1085
01:18:58,206 --> 01:19:01,835
I will sacrifice it gladly
to be a good servant ofour nation.

1086
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:23,158
Hey, I got a large haze.

1087
01:20:25,966 --> 01:20:27,797
That's too big to be planes, right?

1088
01:20:32,126 --> 01:20:34,515
Is that what you want to do?
Knight to knight five?

1089
01:20:34,606 --> 01:20:36,324
Boom! Wrong move.

1090
01:20:36,406 --> 01:20:39,398
Lieutenant! Radar's picking up a large
return moving in from the northeast.

1091
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:41,204
Hang on.

1092
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,436
Relax. It's a flight of B-1 7's
coming in from the mainland.

1093
01:20:47,286 --> 01:20:48,958
Nothing to worry about.

1094
01:20:49,046 --> 01:20:50,525
Heck ofa lot of B-1 7's.

1095
01:20:52,766 --> 01:20:54,324
Good shot, Hot.

1096
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:59,284
This better be good, Commander.

1097
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:03,678
One ofour destroyers reports having
fired and sunk enemy submarine...

1098
01:21:03,766 --> 01:21:07,076
attempting to enter
Pearl Harbor at 0653.

1099
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,202
- It's 7:20.
- We had decoder delays, Admiral.

1100
01:21:09,286 --> 01:21:10,924
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.

1101
01:21:14,886 --> 01:21:16,524
"Failure--

1102
01:21:16,606 --> 01:21:19,245
Peace talks useless."

1103
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:25,482
Thurman here. Tokyo transmitting
to their embassy in Washington.

1104
01:21:25,566 --> 01:21:28,797
"Discontinue use ofyour decoding
machine and dispose of immediately.

1105
01:21:28,886 --> 01:21:32,356
Special emphasis on destroying important
parts." Do you read that? Acknowledge.

1106
01:21:39,886 --> 01:21:42,116
Admiral, Naval lntel intercepted
a transmission from Tokyo...

1107
01:21:42,206 --> 01:21:43,924
to theJapanese embassy
in Washington...

1108
01:21:44,006 --> 01:21:46,361
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines...

1109
01:21:46,446 --> 01:21:48,721
and burn all secret documents.

1110
01:21:48,806 --> 01:21:51,843
TheJapanese are expectin' a war.

1111
01:21:51,926 --> 01:21:53,279
Should we?

1112
01:22:38,006 --> 01:22:42,124
Warning of possibleJapanese
aggressive movement in any direction.

1113
01:22:42,206 --> 01:22:46,165
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent." But where?

1114
01:23:23,446 --> 01:23:25,801
Did you ever
lose a fight, Miller?

1115
01:23:27,286 --> 01:23:28,878
I been lucky so far, Captain.

1116
01:23:28,966 --> 01:23:30,957
From what I hear, it ain't luck.

1117
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:34,765
Ship's proud ofyou, son.

1118
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,040
Come on.

1119
01:23:45,326 --> 01:23:47,157
Come on, come on, come on.

1120
01:23:48,246 --> 01:23:50,282
How do you like that?

1121
01:24:07,566 --> 01:24:11,684
Why the hell is the navy doing
practice this early on a Sunday?

1122
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:02,997
- Heads up!
- Where's that coming from?

1123
01:25:03,086 --> 01:25:04,804
Get down!

1124
01:25:12,686 --> 01:25:15,154
Go! Go, go, go!

1125
01:25:15,246 --> 01:25:18,921
I'm with navy newsreel, and I can tell
you one thing! Them ain't navy planes!

1126

- Manyourbattlestations!
Allhands. manyourbattlestations.

1130
01:26:08,926 --> 01:26:11,315
- Allhands. manyourbattlestations!
- What the heck was that?

1131
01:26:11,406 --> 01:26:13,442
- It's a bomb!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

1132
01:26:13,526 --> 01:26:17,485
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1133
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:21,922

Get me the engine room!

My God.

1137
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:37,756
Take cover!

1138
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:40,235
Down! Down!

1139
01:26:40,326 --> 01:26:43,204
- Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!
- Man your battle stations.

1140
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:44,799
Man your battle stations!

They look likeJaps.

1146
01:27:00,486 --> 01:27:02,954
I didn't even know
theJaps were sore at us.

1147
01:27:03,046 --> 01:27:04,957
Danny, you just get me
into a goddam aeroplane.

1148
01:27:05,046 --> 01:27:06,843
HolyJesus!

1149
01:27:07,846 --> 01:27:10,918
Oh, my God! This is good footage.
Did you see that?

1150
01:27:11,006 --> 01:27:12,997
Holy cow!

1151
01:27:13,086 --> 01:27:14,883
I hope there's still
an airfield left.

1152
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:54,677
- Hurry up!

Everybody to the hospital!

1155
01:28:22,406 --> 01:28:24,237
Why is the navy always buzzin' us?

1156
01:28:25,886 --> 01:28:27,399
Shut up, Red!

1157
01:28:30,046 --> 01:28:31,718
- Hey, come on.

1158
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,637
TheJaps are here!

1159
01:28:35,766 --> 01:28:37,484

01:30:03,086 --> 01:30:04,838
Initiate damage control.

1173
01:30:04,926 --> 01:30:07,724
Find my XO!
Tell him to assume command!

1174
01:30:07,806 --> 01:30:11,481
- And you make sure the gunners--
- Everyone is where
they need to be, Captain.

1175
01:30:11,566 --> 01:30:14,034
You trained us well.

1176
01:30:14,126 --> 01:30:16,799
You trained us well.

1177
01:30:16,886 --> 01:30:18,604
Captain?

1178
01:30:23,006 --> 01:30:25,042
Okay.

01:32:24,566 --> 01:32:27,399
Sir! Captain says

1202
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:30,445
We need more ammo! Now!

1220

1225
01:34:31,485 --> 01:34:34,238
We need to get those planes
fuelled and loaded right now!

1226
01:34:34,325 --> 01:34:36,555
- What's going on out there, huh?
- Danny, what the hell's that noise?

1227
01:34:36,645 --> 01:34:38,636
Youguys doing targetpractice

01:34:48,645 --> 01:34:50,636
- Get down!
- Go, go, go!

1230
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,717
- Billy!
- Run!

1231
01:34:59,805 --> 01:35:01,841
Bomb!

1232
01:35:01,925 --> 01:35:02,914
It's a dud.

1233
01:35:03,005 --> 01:35:04,836
- It's a bomb!
- It's a dud!

1234
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,274
Get down!

1235
01:35:16,165 --> 01:35:18,315
- Danny! Danny, you all right?
- I'm all right!

1236
01:35:18,405 --> 01:35:21,397
Come on! Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
Gooz, come on, man!

1237
01:35:46,925 --> 01:35:49,393
We're sinking! We're sinking!

1238
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:59,202
Stay together!
Close the hatches!

1239
01:36:12,685 --> 01:36:14,755
- I can't swim!
- You hang on!

1240
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:29,400
Move it! Now!

1241
01:36:29,485 --> 01:36:31,237
Joe! Go! Go!

1242
01:36:31,325 --> 01:36:33,634
- Come on!
- We're gettin' out of here!
Get in the car!

1243
01:36:33,725 --> 01:36:35,955
Get in! Get in!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1244
01:36:36,045 --> 01:36:38,513
Get out ofthe way!
Get out ofthe way!

1245
01:36:40,565 --> 01:36:44,444
- Where's this place we're goin'?
- We got a small mechanic runway
about 1 0 minutes away.

1246
01:36:44,525 --> 01:36:45,799
Hasn't been hit yet.

1247
01:36:51,245 --> 01:36:52,883
Zeros on our six!

1248
01:36:58,445 --> 01:36:59,958
Duck!

1249
01:37:52,165 --> 01:37:53,154
We're trapped.

1250
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:57,884
Try-- Try the door!

1251
01:38:23,085 --> 01:38:26,873
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be under!
I'm gonna be under!

1252
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:35,360
- It's sucking me back!
- The current's too strong!

1253
01:38:47,725 --> 01:38:49,556
Watch it!
They're still shootin' us!

1254
01:38:57,205 --> 01:38:59,321
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

1255
01:39:28,765 --> 01:39:31,757
- This is it.
- Help! There's no way out!

1256
01:39:54,805 --> 01:39:56,204
How bad?

1257
01:39:56,285 --> 01:39:58,196
It's still not over, sir.

1258
01:40:02,445 --> 01:40:04,959
An entire fleet at anchor.

1259
01:40:06,685 --> 01:40:09,153
My God. My God.

1260
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,844
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine!

1261
01:40:36,885 --> 01:40:38,557
Fill up the kitchen!
Fill up the ki--

1262
01:40:38,645 --> 01:40:40,556
Are you listening to me?
Fill up the kitchen!

1263
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,036
Over there!
Over there!

1264
01:40:57,165 --> 01:41:00,316
- Bad neck wound here!
We got a dire neck wound!
- Surgery!

1265
01:41:00,405 --> 01:41:02,236
Go! We've got to
get him to surgery!

1266
01:41:02,325 --> 01:41:04,281
Oh, God. In here.

1267
01:41:05,245 --> 01:41:07,759
Guy's still bleeding.
Give me another haemostat.

1268
01:41:07,845 --> 01:41:10,075
Hurry! Haemostat!
Give me a haemostat now!

1269
01:41:13,005 --> 01:41:13,994
Hurry!

1270
01:41:17,565 --> 01:41:19,123
Give me another haemostat.
Give me another suture.

1271
01:41:21,445 --> 01:41:23,436
- Oh, God! I'm so sorry!
- Hurry it up!

1272
01:41:28,965 --> 01:41:32,082
- Doctor!
- Here it is!

1273
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:41,241
Am I gonna die?
Am I gonna die?

1274
01:41:41,325 --> 01:41:42,838
Nurse!

1275
01:41:48,005 --> 01:41:50,883
- Don't leave me!
- Doctor, get over here!

1276
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:56,480
My fingers
are plugging his artery.

1277
01:41:56,565 --> 01:41:59,523
Doctor, what do you need?

1278
01:41:59,605 --> 01:42:01,755
Doctor, focus. Look at me.
What do you need?

1279
01:42:01,845 --> 01:42:03,881
- H-H-H-Haemostat.
- Haemostat.

1280
01:42:06,525 --> 01:42:08,914
Here. All right.
Look at me.

1281
01:42:09,005 --> 01:42:11,678
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

1282
01:42:20,245 --> 01:42:23,840
I need more ammo!
I need more ammo, ladies!

1283
01:42:23,925 --> 01:42:25,916
I need more ammo!

1284
01:42:26,005 --> 01:42:29,122
- Earl! We good to go?
- Yeah, mostly, but--

1285
01:42:29,205 --> 01:42:32,117
- Get down! Get down!
- Shit! Take cover!
- Oh, jeez--

1286
01:42:35,045 --> 01:42:37,434
Oh, my God!
Earl, get in here!

1287
01:42:40,325 --> 01:42:43,044
Hey, Sergeant! They come back around,
we're gonna need more than a shotgun.

1288
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:45,480
You got any other weapons and ammo
you can lay us some cover fire?

1289
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:47,123
Yeah, inside that ammo locker!

1290
01:42:47,205 --> 01:42:49,958
Come on! Let's go! Move it!

1291
01:42:51,205 --> 01:42:53,594
Go! Go! Go!
Gimme a gun, goddam it!

1292
01:42:53,685 --> 01:42:56,836
You said the planes were
mostly ready "but." But what?

1293
01:42:56,925 --> 01:42:59,359
Well, she's down, she's broke,
she's shit. I got four left.

1294
01:42:59,445 --> 01:43:01,720
One's good to go,
two need ammo, one needs fuel.

1295
01:43:01,805 --> 01:43:03,841
Fall out.
Load up in the bunker.

1296
01:43:03,925 --> 01:43:06,678
- Let's go! Get down!
- Move!
- Come on!

1297
01:43:06,765 --> 01:43:09,916
- Get ready to roll.
- Get down! Down!

1298
01:43:10,005 --> 01:43:11,882
All right, Anthony, Red...

1299
01:43:11,965 --> 01:43:14,718
you two are gonna
stay here and man the 50-calibre.

1300
01:43:14,805 --> 01:43:18,559
Gooz, you get up to the next bunker
and you lay down some cover fire,
all right?

1301
01:43:18,645 --> 01:43:19,634
Planes!

1302
01:43:21,965 --> 01:43:24,115
Should we fire?

1303
01:43:24,205 --> 01:43:26,082
Stay down! Stay down!
No, goddam it, hold your fire!

1304
01:43:26,165 --> 01:43:29,760
- Stay still. Nobody fire.
- Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Hold your fire.

1305
01:43:33,285 --> 01:43:35,753
They don't know we're here.

1306
01:43:35,845 --> 01:43:37,961
- Stay down.
- We can fire.
- No, no, no, no, no, goddam it.

1307
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,639
They don't know we're here.
Stay down. Stay still. Don't fire.

1308
01:43:45,365 --> 01:43:46,434
Oh, God.

1309
01:43:54,485 --> 01:43:58,319
I don't see any ordnance.
I think they're goin' home.

1310
01:43:58,405 --> 01:44:00,999
No, they'll be back. We still
got planes on the ground.

1311
01:44:01,085 --> 01:44:04,634
All right, you pilots, listen up.
Get all the airspeed you can
coming offthe runway.

1312
01:44:04,725 --> 01:44:06,841
Don't get on the stick
till you get to the very end.

1313
01:44:06,925 --> 01:44:09,564
When you get in the air,
stay low between the buildings.

1314
01:44:09,645 --> 01:44:13,035
You see any Zero on your tail,
try to wipe him off. Don't freeze.

1315
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:16,401
All right?Just keep moving.
We're gonna try to break 'em up
and separate 'em.

1316
01:44:16,485 --> 01:44:18,953
- That way we can take 'em out
one by one.
- All right.

1317
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:21,195
P-40s can't outrun Zeros,
so don't try.

1318
01:44:21,285 --> 01:44:23,276
We'rejust gonna
have to outfly 'em.

1319
01:44:23,365 --> 01:44:26,357
We got high-level bombers. They're
gonna bust this hangar wide open.

1320
01:44:26,445 --> 01:44:30,120
- Grab the 50s! Let's move!
- Okay!
- Let's go! Let's go!

1321
01:44:30,205 --> 01:44:33,163
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

1322
01:44:36,045 --> 01:44:37,797
- Let's go!
- Zeros!

1323
01:44:38,925 --> 01:44:41,120
Take cover! Take cover!

1324
01:44:44,245 --> 01:44:46,315
Go! Faster!

1325
01:44:50,165 --> 01:44:52,679
Take cover! Take cover!

1326
01:45:03,845 --> 01:45:06,279
- Get down! Get down! Get down!
- Gooz, Danny, come on!

1327
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:12,874
Get in there!

1328
01:45:23,485 --> 01:45:25,203
Danny!

1329
01:45:27,045 --> 01:45:29,957
Come on!
Come on, buddy!

1330
01:45:30,045 --> 01:45:32,718
Leave him! He's dead!
He's dead!

1331
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:43,083
- All right, they're kickin' our butt.
Get to the aeroplanes! Let's go!
- Let's go!

1332
01:45:43,165 --> 01:45:45,963
- Come on. Go, go, go!
- Get up!

1333
01:45:46,045 --> 01:45:48,320
- Danny, let's run!
- Red, Anthony, let's go!

1334
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:55,242
Hey! Come on! Help me!

1335
01:45:58,805 --> 01:46:00,761
Let's do it, Anthony!
Come on!

1336
01:46:07,805 --> 01:46:10,842
- Knock 'em dead.
- Here. Get in.
Here. Put these on.

1337
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:15,879
They're coming around, boys!
Pick it up! Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1338
01:46:22,565 --> 01:46:24,999
Red, get outta here, goddam it!
I'm all right. Go! Go!

1339
01:46:27,605 --> 01:46:29,755
Come on, come on. Let's go.

1340
01:46:29,845 --> 01:46:32,643
-Joe, get out the way!
- I'm rollin'! I'm rollin'!

1341
01:46:34,885 --> 01:46:36,523
Clear, clear! Go!

1342
01:46:36,605 --> 01:46:37,879
Planes!

1343
01:46:39,565 --> 01:46:41,840
Help me, damn it!

1344
01:46:43,645 --> 01:46:48,196
Hey,Joe.Joe, you got three Zeros
right behind you! You got
three Zeros on your six!

1345
01:46:56,165 --> 01:46:57,484
Turn! Turn!

1346
01:46:59,565 --> 01:47:00,554
Oh, God!

1347
01:47:11,965 --> 01:47:15,162
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doing?
Get goin'! Get movin'!

1348
01:47:15,245 --> 01:47:17,236
Danny, start that thing up
and get in the air, now.

1349
01:47:17,325 --> 01:47:19,077
I'm not much good
without a wingman.

1350
01:47:19,165 --> 01:47:20,723
- Ineedyou.
- I got you.

1351
01:47:22,405 --> 01:47:24,316
Let's do it!

1352
01:47:41,645 --> 01:47:44,398
It's real tight, Rafe.
It's real tight.

1353
01:47:58,325 --> 01:48:00,236
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!

1354
01:48:00,325 --> 01:48:02,202
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt!

1355
01:48:02,285 --> 01:48:04,355
Don't freeze.
Don't freeze.

1356
01:48:08,445 --> 01:48:10,913
I don't think I'm gonna
make it up over this.

1357
01:48:11,005 --> 01:48:13,121
Get up! Get up!

1358
01:48:21,445 --> 01:48:22,844
We did it! I'm up!

1359
01:48:24,885 --> 01:48:26,603
We got Zeros behind us, Rafe!

1360
01:48:28,445 --> 01:48:31,801
How many you see back there?

1361
01:48:34,085 --> 01:48:36,394
We got five on our six!

1362
01:48:41,365 --> 01:48:43,242
Take it down
to the deck, Danny! Now!

1363
01:48:51,445 --> 01:48:53,959
We gotta split 'em up, Danny.

1364
01:48:54,045 --> 01:48:57,117
You take left,
I'll take right.

1365
01:49:00,845 --> 01:49:03,484
Earl, you better get some guns
in that goddam tower up there!

1366
01:49:03,565 --> 01:49:06,796
Okay, okay. Let's go!
Get to the truck! Let's go! Follow me!

1367
01:49:12,445 --> 01:49:15,118
Danny, I got three on my six!

1368
01:49:29,805 --> 01:49:31,477
Whoo!

1369
01:49:35,445 --> 01:49:38,642
Stop it! Stop it! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red.

1370
01:49:40,245 --> 01:49:41,644
- Let's go. Move it!
- Gimme the 50!

1371
01:49:43,525 --> 01:49:46,085
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1372
01:49:49,725 --> 01:49:51,716
I still got two
behind me, Rafe.

1373
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:56,320
Coming in! Take cover!

1374
01:50:04,845 --> 01:50:07,120
Son ofa bitch!

1375
01:50:10,605 --> 01:50:12,323
No!

1376
01:50:15,085 --> 01:50:17,918
Earl, do you hear me, goddam it?
Get some guns in that tower!

1377
01:50:18,005 --> 01:50:21,361
On the tower. Yeah.
Goin' ten storeys up.
It's a long son ofa bitch.

1378
01:50:27,725 --> 01:50:30,034
- Look! Look!
- Move it!

1379
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:32,161
Rafe, they're all over me.
I can't get 'em off me!

1380
01:50:40,005 --> 01:50:42,473
Danny, I still got three on my tail.

1381
01:50:45,325 --> 01:50:49,557
- Keep jinkin' it.
Don't let 'em get a handle on you.
- I can't shake 'em, Rafe.

1382
01:50:49,645 --> 01:50:52,113
Damn it.

1383
01:50:52,205 --> 01:50:54,673
Danny, let's play some chicken
with theseJap suckers.

1384
01:50:54,765 --> 01:50:56,960
All right, I'm with you.

1385
01:50:58,045 --> 01:50:59,034
Jesus!

1386
01:51:03,525 --> 01:51:07,564
- I'm comin' right at you, Rafe.
- Don't break till I tell you. Hold on.

1387
01:51:07,645 --> 01:51:09,636
Not yet. Not yet!

1388
01:51:09,725 --> 01:51:11,283
Come on! Come on!

1389
01:51:12,405 --> 01:51:13,520
Go left, now!

1390
01:51:17,805 --> 01:51:20,683
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Whoo! Ha-ha-ha!

1391
01:51:20,765 --> 01:51:23,120
Set up over there!

1392
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:26,164
Come on. Load it.

1393
01:51:26,245 --> 01:51:28,440
Okay, we're at the top ofthe tower.

1394
01:51:29,525 --> 01:51:32,039
Earl, I got one on my tail.
I'm gonna bring him right by you.

1395
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:35,720
He's comin' around! He's comin' around!
Let's get thisJap sucker!

1396
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:40,961
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
Here he comes.

1397
01:51:42,325 --> 01:51:44,441
You better be cocked
and locked when I come by there.

1398
01:51:46,765 --> 01:51:48,517
Hold your fire.

1399
01:51:49,685 --> 01:51:50,913
Fire!

1400
01:51:58,245 --> 01:52:00,076
Whoo!
Good shootin', boys!

1401
01:52:00,165 --> 01:52:01,723
Nicejob. Earl.

1402
01:52:01,805 --> 01:52:04,319
- Now, let's head over
to Battleship Row.
- I'm with you.

1403
01:52:12,685 --> 01:52:14,403
Let's go do some business.

1404
01:52:16,405 --> 01:52:17,394
I'm goin' after 'em.

1405
01:52:28,405 --> 01:52:30,077
Rafe, I got him!

1406
01:52:30,165 --> 01:52:33,635
- Oh, yeah!
- P-40s!
- Yeah!

1407
01:52:35,845 --> 01:52:40,157
They're pullin' out into the clouds,
Danny. We ain't gonna let
these sons of bitches get home.

1408
01:52:46,085 --> 01:52:49,043
How do you like it
when someone's shootin' back at you?

1409
01:52:58,125 --> 01:53:00,639
Oh, I'm on your ass now.

1410
01:53:04,325 --> 01:53:05,917
Danny, I got one!

1411
01:53:07,565 --> 01:53:09,556
Come on.

1412
01:53:20,485 --> 01:53:21,520
Ah! Come on!

1413
01:53:29,965 --> 01:53:32,354
Come on. Stay in there.
Stay in there!

1414
01:53:38,805 --> 01:53:40,761
Whoa!

1415
01:53:43,765 --> 01:53:45,676
I got you, son ofa bitch!

1416
01:54:31,245 --> 01:54:33,236
Who taught you
how to fly, Lieutenant?

1417
01:54:35,405 --> 01:54:36,394
He did.

1418
01:54:40,965 --> 01:54:42,637
All right, Bobby, don't kick.
I know it's hard, but--

1419
01:54:42,725 --> 01:54:46,240
- I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!
- You're not gonna die!

1420
01:54:46,325 --> 01:54:48,395
I got you.
Can you hold on to this--

1421
01:54:48,485 --> 01:54:50,601
Sandra, we're running out
of morphine, so you gotta--

1422
01:54:50,685 --> 01:54:52,721
you gotta mark 'em,
you gotta find some way to mark 'em...

1423
01:54:52,805 --> 01:54:55,273
so we can keep track ofwho's got--
got the morphine already.

1424
01:54:55,365 --> 01:54:58,084
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

1425
01:54:58,165 --> 01:55:03,478
- It's not marking. It's not ma--
Ev, you got a marker?
- Uh, uh, no.

1426
01:55:04,565 --> 01:55:07,523
Use my lipstick.
Put M for morphine.

1427
01:55:07,605 --> 01:55:10,165
- Evelyn, we need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet?

1428
01:55:11,325 --> 01:55:13,555
Where are the clamps?
Hurry.

1429
01:55:18,765 --> 01:55:20,801
There's nothing left.

1430
01:55:22,405 --> 01:55:25,397
- Evelyn.
- Here. Use this.
- I need you to go outside.

1431
01:55:25,485 --> 01:55:27,794
There's too many to help.
Okay? You gotta sort 'em out.

1432
01:55:27,885 --> 01:55:30,445
Only those that can be saved,
you bring in here. You got that?

1433
01:55:30,525 --> 01:55:32,561
- I can't.
- No, please, do it!

1434
01:55:32,645 --> 01:55:34,681
I need you to do it. Go! Go!

1435
01:56:01,085 --> 01:56:03,804
- Don't let in anyone without a mark.
- Stay back!

1436
01:56:03,885 --> 01:56:07,082
- I told you, stand back!
- Stay outside. Keep 'em outside.

1437
01:56:07,165 --> 01:56:10,601
Come on! Let's go!
Take this guy up!

1438
01:56:11,765 --> 01:56:16,202
- Wait here.
- Don't touch me, youJap!
Get your hands off me!

1439
01:56:16,285 --> 01:56:19,118
- He's critical. Get him into Critical!
- Keep him off me. Keep him off me!

1440
01:56:19,205 --> 01:56:20,524
Critical, front ward!

1441
01:56:22,685 --> 01:56:24,880
How bad am l?

1442
01:56:24,965 --> 01:56:27,798
- You're gonna bejust fine, sweetheart.
- I don't wanna die!
- You're gonna bejust fine.

1443
01:56:27,885 --> 01:56:30,843
You're not gonna die, sweetheart.
I got your hand.

1444
01:56:31,725 --> 01:56:33,841
Give him enough morphine
to make him comfortable.
He's not gonna make it.

1445
01:56:33,925 --> 01:56:36,837
Line the critical up in the ward.
Get him morphine. Take him over there.

1446
01:56:36,925 --> 01:56:39,644
- Take the burn victims by the trees.
- I just found her.

1447
01:56:39,725 --> 01:56:44,162
- I-l-l don't--
I don't think she's breathing.
- No, she's dead. Take her.

1448
01:56:46,805 --> 01:56:49,160
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God!

1449
01:56:51,325 --> 01:56:53,555
Oh, are you sure, Ev?
Could you check her one more time
to be sure?

1450
01:56:53,645 --> 01:56:56,159
She's dead, Sandra, she's dead.
Take her over there.

1451
01:56:56,245 --> 01:56:58,805
- You've got to be sure before you--
- She's dead. Get back to work.
- Oh, my God!

1452
01:56:58,885 --> 01:57:00,796
Go back to work, Sandra.

1453
01:57:02,085 --> 01:57:04,155
I don't know what to do.

1454
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:34,844
- Over here!
- Admiral?

1455
01:58:34,925 --> 01:58:36,722
From Washington.

1456
01:58:38,645 --> 01:58:40,601
"Attack byJapan considered imminent."

1457
01:58:45,405 --> 01:58:47,236
They're only an hour late.

1458
01:59:42,805 --> 01:59:46,480
- How can we help?
- We need blood. Come on.

1459
01:59:49,445 --> 01:59:51,481
Remember, son,
hold on to your faith.

1460
01:59:51,565 --> 01:59:53,601
- 1 ,500 cartons over there.
- Remember whatJesus said:

1461
01:59:53,685 --> 01:59:57,155
"Today you will be with me
in paradise." So fear not.

1462
01:59:57,245 --> 01:59:59,156
Fear not, my son.

1463
01:59:59,245 --> 02:00:01,634
You are a man truly blessed.
Truly blessed.

1464
02:00:01,725 --> 02:00:03,716
You will die
in a state of grace.

1465
02:00:04,605 --> 02:00:08,041
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.

1466
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:10,081
Hold on to your faith, my son.

1467
02:00:10,165 --> 02:00:13,601
You will be with God and all
the saints, all the angels very soon.

1468
02:00:13,685 --> 02:00:15,960
I absolve you ofyour sins
in the name ofthe Father...

1469
02:00:16,045 --> 02:00:18,036
and ofthe Son
and the Holy Spirit.

1470
02:00:21,405 --> 02:00:22,724
Amen.

1471
02:00:29,405 --> 02:00:31,396
Go with God, my son.

1472
02:00:37,565 --> 02:00:39,476
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbour.

1473
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:41,396
We need help
from anybody who can move.

1474
02:00:41,485 --> 02:00:43,635
Don't lose us!
Keep swimming!

1475
02:00:46,125 --> 02:00:49,197
- Get us outta here!
- Help!

1476
02:00:49,285 --> 02:00:52,277
There's somebody in here!
Get somebody down here!

1477
02:00:54,925 --> 02:00:57,393
- They're cuttin' through!
- Yeah!

1478
02:00:59,005 --> 02:01:01,519
Get us outta here!

1479
02:01:01,605 --> 02:01:04,597
I hear somebody!
Let's get some guys over here!

1480
02:01:04,685 --> 02:01:06,516
Pull!

1481
02:01:09,165 --> 02:01:12,077
- Get us outta here!
- The room's filling up with water!

1482
02:01:12,165 --> 02:01:13,723
Get an air line in here!

1483
02:01:16,165 --> 02:01:18,076
- Help us! Hurry!
- The air hose!

1484
02:01:18,165 --> 02:01:19,200
What can we do?

1485
02:01:23,525 --> 02:01:25,004
It won't cut any faster!

1486
02:01:28,525 --> 02:01:29,753
Cut 'em out!

1487
02:02:02,725 --> 02:02:04,477
Yesterday...

1488
02:02:04,565 --> 02:02:08,274
December 7, 1 941 ...

1489
02:02:09,725 --> 02:02:12,523
a date which will live
in infamy...

1490
02:02:12,605 --> 02:02:18,521
the United States ofAmerica was
suddenly and deliberately attacked...

1491
02:02:18,605 --> 02:02:20,960
bynavalandairforces...

1492
02:02:21,045 --> 02:02:22,922
ofthe Empire ofJapan.

1493
02:02:25,205 --> 02:02:28,242
It is obvious
thatplanning the attack...

1494
02:02:28,325 --> 02:02:30,793
began many weeks ago.

1495
02:02:30,885 --> 02:02:33,797
During the intervening time...

1496
02:02:33,885 --> 02:02:36,957
theJapanesegovernment
hasdeliberatelysought...

1497
02:02:37,045 --> 02:02:39,036
to deceive the United States...

1498
02:02:39,125 --> 02:02:42,800
by false statements
and expressions of hope...

1499
02:02:42,885 --> 02:02:45,843
forcontinuedpeace.

1500
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:50,680
The attackyesterday
on the Hawaiian lslands...

1501
02:02:50,765 --> 02:02:55,475
has causedsevere damage
toAmerican militaryforces.

1502
02:02:55,565 --> 02:03:00,320
Iregret to tellyou
that over3.000American lives...

1503
02:03:00,405 --> 02:03:02,635
have been lost.

1504
02:03:02,725 --> 02:03:05,239
No matter how long
it may take us...

1505
02:03:05,325 --> 02:03:08,761
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

1506
02:03:08,845 --> 02:03:11,837
theAmericanpeople
in theirrighteousmight...

1507
02:03:12,925 --> 02:03:14,278
will win through...

1508
02:03:14,365 --> 02:03:16,435
to absolute victory.

1509
02:03:19,525 --> 02:03:21,436
Because ofthis...

1510
02:03:21,525 --> 02:03:25,154
unprovoked. dastardlyattack
byJapan...

1511
02:03:25,245 --> 02:03:28,999
I ask that the Congress
declare a state ofwar.

1512
02:03:34,485 --> 02:03:36,601
Is it true...

1513
02:03:36,685 --> 02:03:39,677
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?

1514
02:03:41,605 --> 02:03:43,561
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

1515
02:03:43,645 --> 02:03:46,876
We're doing everything
we can to get to them,
but they're 40 feet below water.

1516
02:03:53,405 --> 02:03:55,555
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible...

1517
02:03:56,925 --> 02:03:59,485
and now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...

1518
02:03:59,565 --> 02:04:01,954
by an enemy
we considered inferior.

1519
02:04:03,445 --> 02:04:05,720
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

1520
02:04:05,805 --> 02:04:09,400
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

1521
02:04:09,485 --> 02:04:12,158
We're preparing an attack against
the Marshall and Gilbert lslands, sir,
to keep our--

1522
02:04:12,245 --> 02:04:15,840
I'm talking about hitting the heart
ofJapan the way they have hit us.

1523
02:04:17,565 --> 02:04:21,160
Mr President,
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares...

1524
02:04:21,245 --> 02:04:22,963
because we didn't face facts.

1525
02:04:23,045 --> 02:04:25,878
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

1526
02:04:25,965 --> 02:04:29,196
The Army Air Corps has long-range
bombers but no place to launch them.

1527
02:04:29,285 --> 02:04:31,958
Midway is too far,
and Russia...

1528
02:04:32,045 --> 02:04:34,275
won't allow us
to launch a raid from there.

1529
02:04:35,685 --> 02:04:37,960
- Admiral?
- The navy's planes are small.

1530
02:04:38,045 --> 02:04:39,797
They carry light loads
and have a short range.

1531
02:04:39,885 --> 02:04:42,524
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles ofJapan...

1532
02:04:42,605 --> 02:04:45,517
and therefore risk our carriers,
and ifwe lose our carriers...

1533
02:04:45,605 --> 02:04:47,675
we'll have no shield
against invasion.

1534
02:04:47,765 --> 02:04:49,357
Does anyone in this room...

1535
02:04:49,445 --> 02:04:52,198
think that victory is possible
without facing danger?

1536
02:04:52,285 --> 02:04:55,197
We are at war.
Ofcourse there's a risk.

1537
02:04:55,285 --> 02:04:57,355
But consider the risk,
Mr President.

1538
02:04:57,445 --> 02:04:59,879
IftheJapanese
invade us right now...

1539
02:04:59,965 --> 02:05:03,002
they would penetrate as far
as Chicago before we could stop them.

1540
02:05:05,405 --> 02:05:06,758
Gentlemen...

1541
02:05:09,045 --> 02:05:12,276
most ofyou did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

1542
02:05:13,845 --> 02:05:17,121
I was strong and proud
and arrogant.

1543
02:05:18,085 --> 02:05:20,758
Now I wonder
every hour of my life...

1544
02:05:20,845 --> 02:05:23,313
why God put me
into this chair.

1545
02:05:24,445 --> 02:05:27,835
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my countrymen...

1546
02:05:27,925 --> 02:05:33,124
in your eyes right now, I start to think
that maybe he brought me down...

1547
02:05:33,205 --> 02:05:37,084
for times like these when we all need
to be reminded who we truly are--

1548
02:05:37,165 --> 02:05:39,918
that we will not give up
or give in.

1549
02:05:40,005 --> 02:05:41,597
Mr President,
with all respect, sir.

1550
02:05:41,685 --> 02:05:43,516
What you're asking can't be done.

1551
02:05:58,405 --> 02:06:02,478
- Mr President--
- Mr President!
- Get back, George. Get back.

1552
02:06:14,525 --> 02:06:16,720
Do not tell me...

1553
02:06:16,805 --> 02:06:18,716
it can't be done.

1554
02:06:23,845 --> 02:06:27,520
Japan continues itsmilitaryconquest
throughout the Pacific.

1555
02:06:29,005 --> 02:06:31,565
But. backhome.
millions ofAmerican workers...

1556
02:06:31,645 --> 02:06:35,558
bandtogether. bringing factories
to life to avenge PearIHarbor.

1557
02:06:39,925 --> 02:06:43,634
Mr President, I think we have an idea
about how to bomb theJapanese.

1558
02:06:43,725 --> 02:06:46,683
Sir, it's risky, but it's bold.

1559
02:06:47,805 --> 02:06:50,524
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

1560
02:06:50,605 --> 02:06:52,516
Captain Low, Mr President.

1561
02:06:53,605 --> 02:06:55,755
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea, sir.

1562
02:06:55,845 --> 02:06:58,279
I like sub commanders.

1563
02:06:58,365 --> 02:07:01,960
They don't have time for bullshit,
and neither do l.

1564
02:07:02,045 --> 02:07:03,763
Fire away, gentlemen.

1565
02:07:19,485 --> 02:07:21,396
And where is God in all this?

1566
02:07:23,245 --> 02:07:26,715
Our enemies believe
that a divine wind protects them.

1567
02:07:28,005 --> 02:07:30,439
But we see our friends
laid out here before us--

1568
02:07:52,685 --> 02:07:54,004
Hey, Cap'n.

1569
02:08:16,325 --> 02:08:19,317
- Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker?
- Major.

1570
02:08:20,325 --> 02:08:22,634
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

1571
02:08:22,725 --> 02:08:23,919
What for, sir?

1572
02:08:24,005 --> 02:08:25,563
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

1573
02:08:29,205 --> 02:08:30,399
Yes, sir.

1574
02:08:34,405 --> 02:08:35,804
Over there.

1575
02:08:45,725 --> 02:08:47,716
Packing.

1576
02:08:49,845 --> 02:08:50,994
Orders.

1577
02:08:52,085 --> 02:08:54,997
What kind oforders?

1578
02:08:55,085 --> 02:08:57,155
The top secret kind.

1579
02:08:57,245 --> 02:08:59,918
Dangerous kind.

1580
02:09:01,205 --> 02:09:02,638
I, uh, can't find Danny.

1581
02:09:02,725 --> 02:09:06,274
That why you're here?
Looking for Danny?

1582
02:09:07,645 --> 02:09:10,955
He's probably
saying goodbye to his squadron.
We've been assigned to Doolittle.

1583
02:09:19,485 --> 02:09:21,476
I wasn't looking for Danny.

1584
02:09:26,085 --> 02:09:29,157
I couldn't have you go away
without you understanding something.

1585
02:09:34,605 --> 02:09:36,835
Yeah, well, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

1586
02:09:36,925 --> 02:09:39,917
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

1587
02:09:41,205 --> 02:09:44,197
Evelyn, loving you
kept me alive.

1588
02:09:55,085 --> 02:09:57,235
I should've died over there.

1589
02:09:57,325 --> 02:10:00,362
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

1590
02:10:02,365 --> 02:10:04,196
I told Him I was sorry.

1591
02:10:04,285 --> 02:10:06,719
I told Him I knew I'd been
a fool for leaving you...

1592
02:10:06,805 --> 02:10:09,717
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

1593
02:10:09,805 --> 02:10:11,955
and I promised I'd never
ask for anything again...

1594
02:10:13,965 --> 02:10:15,921
if I could just see you
one more time.

1595
02:10:19,525 --> 02:10:21,117
You know what?

1596
02:10:22,405 --> 02:10:23,804
It was worth it.

1597
02:10:26,045 --> 02:10:28,923
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

1598
02:10:30,365 --> 02:10:32,401
So I'm gonna stand by
my end ofthe deal.

1599
02:10:32,485 --> 02:10:35,875
I'm gonna walk away,
and I won't askyou for anything.

1600
02:10:37,205 --> 02:10:38,957
But I just wanna know why.

1601
02:10:39,045 --> 02:10:42,003
Just tell me that, will you, please?
Just tell me why.

1602
02:10:43,685 --> 02:10:45,676
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

1603
02:10:54,485 --> 02:10:55,804
Oh, my God.

1604
02:10:59,325 --> 02:11:02,237
I didn't even know until the day
you turned up alive.

1605
02:11:04,125 --> 02:11:06,116
And then all this happened.

1606
02:11:07,605 --> 02:11:10,597
I haven't told Danny.

1607
02:11:10,685 --> 02:11:12,596
I don't want him to know.

1608
02:11:12,685 --> 02:11:16,917
All he needs to think about is how
to do this mission and get back alive.

1609
02:11:20,285 --> 02:11:24,642
Rafe, all I ever wanted
was for us to have a home...

1610
02:11:24,725 --> 02:11:29,082
and grow old together, but life
never asked me what I wanted.

1611
02:11:29,165 --> 02:11:31,725
Now I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

1612
02:11:34,365 --> 02:11:38,278
but I don't think I'll ever look at
another sunset without thinking ofyou.

1613
02:11:41,965 --> 02:11:43,956
I'll love you my whole life.

1614
02:12:20,045 --> 02:12:21,956
I'll see you on board.

1615
02:12:38,805 --> 02:12:41,399
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

1616
02:12:42,925 --> 02:12:45,200
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

1617
02:12:48,005 --> 02:12:50,917
I love you, Danny...

1618
02:12:52,445 --> 02:12:54,913
and I'll be here
waiting foryou when you come back.

1619
02:13:12,325 --> 02:13:13,553
Follow me.

1620
02:13:17,045 --> 02:13:18,444
Colonel.

1621
02:13:22,445 --> 02:13:25,517
- Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.
- I heard what you did.

1622
02:13:25,605 --> 02:13:27,436
We can explain that, sir.

1623
02:13:27,525 --> 02:13:29,243
Explain what?

1624
02:13:29,325 --> 02:13:31,964
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

1625
02:13:32,045 --> 02:13:34,764
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

1626
02:13:39,005 --> 02:13:40,916
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

1627
02:13:44,285 --> 02:13:46,321
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

1628
02:13:47,525 --> 02:13:49,197
and promoted to captain.

1629
02:13:51,045 --> 02:13:52,956
Is that the good news, sir, or--

1630
02:13:53,045 --> 02:13:56,321
You'rejust about the only pilots
in the army with combat experience.

1631
02:13:57,405 --> 02:14:00,636
I need you for a mission
I've been ordered to put together.

1632
02:14:02,045 --> 02:14:05,401
- You know what top secret is?
- Yes, sir.

1633
02:14:05,485 --> 02:14:07,874
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

1634
02:14:07,965 --> 02:14:09,876
But they send them
to your relatives.

1635
02:14:09,965 --> 02:14:11,921
Top secret means
you train for something...

1636
02:14:12,005 --> 02:14:14,519
never done before
in aviation history...

1637
02:14:14,605 --> 02:14:16,516
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

1638
02:14:17,805 --> 02:14:21,320
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

1639
02:14:21,405 --> 02:14:22,633
I'll go, sir.

1640
02:14:23,645 --> 02:14:25,317
I'll go too, sir.

1641
02:14:27,045 --> 02:14:28,922
By the way, McCawley,
the Brits sent this over.

1642
02:14:29,005 --> 02:14:31,394
- It's your personal effects.
- Thankyou, sir.

1643
02:14:31,485 --> 02:14:33,919
There's only one more thing
I can tell you.

1644
02:14:34,005 --> 02:14:36,803
Leave your goddam hula shirts
at home.

1645
02:14:39,644 --> 02:14:43,717
Dear Rafe, it's so strange
to be this far from you...

1646
02:14:43,804 --> 02:14:47,319
but you should know this:
every night--

1647
02:14:56,324 --> 02:14:58,474
I've been looking
all over foryou.

1648
02:14:59,684 --> 02:15:02,437
Danny, this-- this--

1649
02:15:02,524 --> 02:15:04,913
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

1650
02:15:06,004 --> 02:15:07,915
We gotta face facts here.

1651
02:15:08,004 --> 02:15:12,043
The fact is, wejust both
love the same woman.

1652
02:15:18,364 --> 02:15:21,242
You know, she's the first girl
I ever felt this way about, Rafe.

1653
02:15:24,524 --> 02:15:27,436
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

1654
02:15:30,804 --> 02:15:33,113
This is different, though, Danny.

1655
02:15:33,204 --> 02:15:36,833
Evelyn already lost the man she loved
once. I just don't want to see
that happen to her again.

1656
02:15:36,924 --> 02:15:39,916
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.

1657
02:15:40,004 --> 02:15:41,642
She knows that.

1658
02:15:41,724 --> 02:15:45,273
Danny, don't do this.
Don't go on this mission.

1659
02:15:46,604 --> 02:15:48,276
You got nothing to prove.

1660
02:15:49,884 --> 02:15:51,795
You've been trying to protect me
since we were kids.

1661
02:15:53,404 --> 02:15:56,919
Yeah, well, you do tend
to need it from time to time.

1662
02:16:15,604 --> 02:16:19,233
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer
for is exceptionally dangerous.

1663
02:16:20,444 --> 02:16:22,674
Take a look
at the man beside you.

1664
02:16:22,764 --> 02:16:25,039
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...

1665
02:16:25,124 --> 02:16:28,321
you or he...

1666
02:16:28,404 --> 02:16:30,315
will be dead.

1667
02:16:32,604 --> 02:16:34,879
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

1668
02:16:36,604 --> 02:16:37,832
step forward.

1669
02:16:45,444 --> 02:16:49,960
Your grandmother could take a B-25 off
on a mile-long runway.

1670
02:16:50,044 --> 02:16:53,673
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

1671
02:16:54,804 --> 02:16:58,035
Because at 468 feet...

1672
02:16:58,124 --> 02:17:00,115
you're dead.

1673
02:17:00,204 --> 02:17:03,594
And once you get it up, you're gonna
learn to fly it like a fighter...

1674
02:17:03,684 --> 02:17:06,323
thirty feet offthe ground.

1675
02:17:06,404 --> 02:17:09,396
I want you to say hello to Lieutenant
Jack Richards, Navy Aviation.

1676
02:17:09,484 --> 02:17:11,759
He's gonna help us lighten
these fat ladies here.

1677
02:17:12,644 --> 02:17:16,034
Dump that ashcan.
See that bombsight? Get rid of it.

1678
02:17:16,124 --> 02:17:19,719
- Colonel, he's crazy.
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.

1679
02:17:19,804 --> 02:17:21,556
She's a fat lady.
We want a skinny lady.

1680
02:17:26,564 --> 02:17:27,474
Max power!

1681
02:17:30,924 --> 02:17:32,880
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1682
02:17:32,964 --> 02:17:35,717
- Damn!
- How in the heckyou--
- Damn!

1683
02:17:43,244 --> 02:17:44,962
Theyjust keep rolling
past that line.

1684
02:17:45,044 --> 02:17:48,957
- Maybe this mission's a bad idea.
- No, they're too heavy. We got
to get drastic with these planes.

1685
02:17:49,044 --> 02:17:50,557
This armoured plating's
got to go.

1686
02:17:50,644 --> 02:17:54,273
- I'm sure. I'm sure.
Now, lose it like a skirt, son.
- Release brakes!

1687
02:17:56,884 --> 02:17:58,203
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1688
02:18:00,044 --> 02:18:03,753
- God!
- Put every man on the line now!

1689
02:18:06,324 --> 02:18:08,280
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!

1690
02:18:10,284 --> 02:18:12,115
Come on! Max power!

1691
02:18:16,964 --> 02:18:20,161
Well, if he can do it--

1692
02:18:35,724 --> 02:18:39,273
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you
that we're going to Tokyo.

1693
02:18:40,964 --> 02:18:43,558
And we're gonna bomb it.

1694
02:18:48,164 --> 02:18:52,442
That comes as a special request
directly from President Roosevelt.

1695
02:18:52,524 --> 02:18:56,915
The navy's gonna sneak us about
400 miles offtheJapanese coast,
and we'll launch from the carrier there.

1696
02:18:57,004 --> 02:19:00,917
Has that ever even been done before?
Taking army bombers offa navy carrier?

1697
02:19:01,004 --> 02:19:02,995
No.

1698
02:19:03,084 --> 02:19:03,994
Okay.

1699
02:19:04,084 --> 02:19:06,473
- Any other questions?
- Well, sir...

1700
02:19:06,564 --> 02:19:09,920
is it even possible to land a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

1701
02:19:10,004 --> 02:19:11,995
That won't matter.

1702
02:19:12,084 --> 02:19:14,917
As soon as we're airborne, the carrier
will head straight back for Hawaii.

1703
02:19:15,004 --> 02:19:17,120
But ifthe carriers head home,
where do we land?

1704
02:19:17,204 --> 02:19:19,923
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

1705
02:19:24,404 --> 02:19:26,713
It means "I am an American."

1706
02:19:28,244 --> 02:19:29,836
In Chinese.

1707
02:19:31,004 --> 02:19:35,043
Ain't gonna be any easier. That's three
feet shorter than our practice runway.

1708
02:19:35,124 --> 02:19:37,035
- Fellas?
- Sir.

1709
02:19:38,204 --> 02:19:39,523
Sir.

1710
02:19:41,164 --> 02:19:45,362
- Secretary ofthe navy gave me these.
- What are they?

1711
02:19:45,444 --> 02:19:48,834
Friendship medals theJapanese gave us
when they were pretending
they wanted peace.

1712
02:19:48,924 --> 02:19:52,712
- What do they want you
to do with them, sir?
- We're gonna wire them
to the bombs and give them back.

1713
02:19:56,884 --> 02:19:59,876
- So what's going on?
- Well, sir, we only have 1 6 planes.

1714
02:19:59,964 --> 02:20:01,113
So?

1715
02:20:01,204 --> 02:20:03,843
When theJaps hit us,
they had more than 300.

1716
02:20:03,924 --> 02:20:06,484
I mean, how much difference
we really gonna make?

1717
02:20:06,564 --> 02:20:11,638
It's not that we're afraid, sir.
It'sjust that we might die doing this,
and we wanna know what it's for.

1718
02:20:14,724 --> 02:20:17,796
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

1719
02:20:19,604 --> 02:20:22,721
This raid,
even ifwe make it through...

1720
02:20:22,804 --> 02:20:25,318
it'll only be a pinprick.

1721
02:20:25,404 --> 02:20:27,315
But it'll be straight
through their hearts.

1722
02:20:28,724 --> 02:20:33,514
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most
and believe in it the longest.

1723
02:20:35,484 --> 02:20:39,716
We're gonna believe. We're gonna
make America believe too.

1724
02:20:39,804 --> 02:20:41,795
Colonel! I need a minute.

1725
02:20:44,524 --> 02:20:48,039
- Excuse me, MajorJackson.
- Yes.
- Do you remember me?

1726
02:20:49,404 --> 02:20:53,283
Oh, sure I do. I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thankyou.

1727
02:20:53,364 --> 02:20:55,036
Maybe you can.

1728
02:20:55,124 --> 02:20:58,514
When the news starts coming in about
those boys in the Doolittle outfit...

1729
02:20:58,604 --> 02:21:01,277
- I wanna be in the command post.
- I'm sorry.

1730
02:21:01,364 --> 02:21:03,594
I-l don't know
what you're talking about.

1731
02:21:05,444 --> 02:21:08,436
How in the hell do you know
about this mission, Lieutenant?

1732
02:21:08,524 --> 02:21:10,480
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.

1733
02:21:10,564 --> 02:21:12,794
You mean some fly boy
you're dating shot his mouth off.

1734
02:21:14,444 --> 02:21:16,799
Actually, It's about two pilots.

1735
02:21:16,884 --> 02:21:19,114
I know they're going
into great danger.

1736
02:21:19,204 --> 02:21:22,514
I just wanna be there
when the news comes in
to tell us ifthey've lived or died.

1737
02:21:26,964 --> 02:21:28,955
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

1738
02:21:29,044 --> 02:21:33,003
Most nurses would have gone on
to someone else instead of keeping
their fingers plugged in your artery.

1739
02:21:38,524 --> 02:21:41,721
I can't promise you anything.

1740
02:21:41,804 --> 02:21:46,514
One, two, three, one!
One, two, three, two!
One, two, three--

1741
02:21:46,604 --> 02:21:51,803
Hey, Red, you think theyjust picked us
to do this 'cause we're young and dumb?

1742
02:21:53,604 --> 02:21:55,515
Come on, Gooz.
We're the tip ofthe sword.

1743
02:22:11,924 --> 02:22:16,440
All right,
in honour ofour trip toJapan,
I got us some, uh, victory cigars!

1744
02:22:16,524 --> 02:22:19,243
Yeah, victory cigars!
There you go.

1745
02:22:19,324 --> 02:22:21,360
Put that in your inside pocket
next to your heart.

1746
02:22:21,444 --> 02:22:25,835
You know,Jack, we may lose this battle,
but we're gonna win this war.

1747
02:22:25,924 --> 02:22:27,915
- You know how I know?
- No.

1748
02:22:30,164 --> 02:22:31,074
Them.

1749
02:22:32,324 --> 02:22:34,884
Because they're rare.

1750
02:22:34,964 --> 02:22:37,432
And in times like these,
you see them...

1751
02:22:39,004 --> 02:22:40,153
stepping forward.

1752
02:22:41,964 --> 02:22:45,195
There's nothing stronger
than the heart ofa volunteer,Jack.

1753
02:22:50,484 --> 02:22:53,954
My friends in the War Department
don't want me to lead this raid...

1754
02:22:54,044 --> 02:22:56,956
because they say I'm too valuable.

1755
02:22:57,044 --> 02:23:01,003
They don't want me up in the air
flying with the men that I've chosen...

1756
02:23:01,084 --> 02:23:04,394
that I've chewed out, cussed out,
pushed to the limit...

1757
02:23:07,204 --> 02:23:09,115
and that I've come to respect.

1758
02:23:11,324 --> 02:23:16,000
They want me to stand
in the flight deck and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.

1759
02:23:17,684 --> 02:23:19,595
So I'm going with you.

1760
02:23:23,764 --> 02:23:27,473
We take offtomorrow afternoon,
drop our fire and head for China.

1761
02:23:27,564 --> 02:23:31,796
Our mission is to hit military targets,
aircraft and tank factories.

1762
02:23:31,884 --> 02:23:32,873
Colonel...

1763
02:23:32,964 --> 02:23:37,435
you've given us the homing beacons,
but you've also told us that China
is overrun withJapanese troops.

1764
02:23:37,524 --> 02:23:39,435
What do we do
ifthe beacons are switched off?

1765
02:23:39,524 --> 02:23:42,516
You bring her down any way you can
and do your best to avoid capture.

1766
02:23:42,604 --> 02:23:45,482
What do we do ifour planes are damaged
and we have to bail out overJapan?

1767
02:23:45,564 --> 02:23:49,762
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what you should do.

1768
02:23:49,844 --> 02:23:51,641
What would you do, Colonel?

1769
02:23:54,644 --> 02:23:56,794
I wasn't built to be a prisoner.

1770
02:23:58,324 --> 02:24:01,555
So I would have my crew bail out.

1771
02:24:01,644 --> 02:24:03,839
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

1772
02:24:03,924 --> 02:24:07,280
and drive my plane
right smack into the middle of it.

1773
02:24:10,684 --> 02:24:12,595
But that'sjust me.

1774
02:24:15,124 --> 02:24:17,035
I'm 45 years old.
I'm an old man.

1775
02:24:17,124 --> 02:24:20,400
You guys have
your whole lives ahead ofyou.

1776
02:24:20,484 --> 02:24:22,395
So what you do is up to you.

1777
02:24:29,524 --> 02:24:32,482
The mission will launch
in a couple of hours.

1778
02:24:32,564 --> 02:24:34,714
You'll stay right in here.

1779
02:24:37,884 --> 02:24:41,240
Here. Stay here. Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.

1780
02:24:41,324 --> 02:24:43,884
Pretend to type whatever information
we pass you. That's it.

1781
02:24:45,804 --> 02:24:49,513
This is OrphanAnnie
from Radio Tokyo...

1782
02:24:49,604 --> 02:24:52,038
to allthe lonelyboys
in theSouth Pacific.

1783
02:24:52,124 --> 02:24:56,037
- Watch out. The enemy willgetyou.
- Maybe she's right.

1784
02:24:59,884 --> 02:25:02,398
Japs transmitting!
Japs transmitting!

1785
02:25:03,804 --> 02:25:07,114
Captain, Radar reportsJapanese
patrol boats range of400 yards.

1786
02:25:07,204 --> 02:25:09,274
- How many yards?
- 400 yards and closing, sir.

1787
02:25:09,364 --> 02:25:12,276
Richards!Japs! 400 yards.
Let's go!

1788
02:25:12,364 --> 02:25:15,003
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire!

1789
02:25:15,084 --> 02:25:17,803
We gotta sink theseJap boats
before they give away our position.

1790
02:25:17,884 --> 02:25:19,112
Go to general quarters!

1791
02:25:19,204 --> 02:25:21,479
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1792
02:25:22,564 --> 02:25:23,838
Oh, my God.

1793
02:25:24,924 --> 02:25:26,437
This can't be good.

1794
02:25:26,524 --> 02:25:28,674
Allhands.
manyourbattlestations!

1795
02:25:32,524 --> 02:25:35,561
Japs one mile away!
They've reported our position!

1796
02:25:35,644 --> 02:25:38,317
We're supposed to launch 400 miles away.
How far are we now?

1797
02:25:38,404 --> 02:25:39,883
624 miles.

1798
02:25:39,964 --> 02:25:42,034
-Jesus!
- What do you wanna do?

1799
02:25:42,124 --> 02:25:44,922
624 miles--

1800
02:25:46,884 --> 02:25:48,442
I don't know. Colonel...

1801
02:25:48,524 --> 02:25:50,719
I don't know ifthe planes can carry
enough fuel to make it to China.

1802
02:25:51,604 --> 02:25:53,640
Now. We launch now!

1803
02:25:55,124 --> 02:25:57,240
Army pilots, man your planes!

1804
02:25:57,324 --> 02:25:59,201
Manyourplanes!

1805
02:26:01,804 --> 02:26:03,840
They're shooting at something.

1806
02:26:17,044 --> 02:26:19,114
Colonel,
we're too far out to make it.

1807
02:26:19,204 --> 02:26:22,196
These planes need more fuel,
but ifthey're too heavy,
they might not get offthe deck.

1808
02:26:22,284 --> 02:26:25,833
Listen. I want you to strip
everything out ofthis plane
you don't need, and I mean now.

1809
02:26:27,484 --> 02:26:29,520
Start preflight. Let's go!

1810
02:26:29,604 --> 02:26:32,164
Add ten more cans offuel
for each plane.

1811
02:26:32,244 --> 02:26:33,962
Every plane!

1812
02:26:37,164 --> 02:26:40,236
- Let's go! Let's go! Move!
- Come on, you guys. Get up there!

1813
02:26:40,324 --> 02:26:42,121
Lose those suitcases now!

1814
02:26:42,204 --> 02:26:43,842
- What's your favourite gun?
- What?

1815
02:26:43,924 --> 02:26:48,202
You wanna get offthis deck,
you give me one ofthose guns now.
It's still too heavy.

1816
02:26:50,204 --> 02:26:54,402
Yo. I want you to go to the kitchen,
get some broomsticks. Cut 'em down,
paint 'em black and bring 'em here.

1817
02:26:54,484 --> 02:26:57,442
- You're gonna put a broomstick
where this gun was.
- A broomstick.

1818
02:26:57,524 --> 02:26:59,116
Your plane's gonna be fine.

1819
02:26:59,204 --> 02:27:01,923
You tell your crew to take a piss
before they take off, or they're
not gonna clear the deck.

1820
02:27:05,004 --> 02:27:10,237
- We've got broomsticks for tail guns.
- Yeah, maybe it'll scare 'em.

1821
02:27:10,324 --> 02:27:13,316
- You take care ofyourself up there.
- Yeah. I will.

1822
02:27:13,404 --> 02:27:16,282
Danny, be careful.
You hear me?

1823
02:27:16,364 --> 02:27:20,516
- I will. I'll see you, Rafe.
- Rafe, we're the tip ofthe sword.

1824
02:27:26,484 --> 02:27:29,556
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!

1825
02:27:33,884 --> 02:27:35,681
All right.

1826
02:27:35,764 --> 02:27:37,356
You ready for this?

1827
02:27:39,284 --> 02:27:42,037
- Superchargers low and latched.
- Superchargers are low and latched.

1828
02:27:42,124 --> 02:27:43,716
We're full into the wind.

1829
02:27:43,804 --> 02:27:45,840
More speed! More speed!

1830
02:27:57,044 --> 02:27:59,160
- Are you nervous?
- No-- Yes, sir. Yes.

1831
02:27:59,244 --> 02:28:03,362
- When did you find religion?
- When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.

1832
02:28:03,444 --> 02:28:05,594
- I want you to do me a favour.
- What's that, Colonel?

1833
02:28:05,684 --> 02:28:08,039
- Pray for both of us.
- It's gotta be right!

1834
02:28:08,124 --> 02:28:09,443
Let's go!

1835
02:28:17,884 --> 02:28:19,795
Max power!

1836
02:28:22,404 --> 02:28:23,314
Up, please!

1837
02:28:25,004 --> 02:28:27,279
Come on! Come on!

1838
02:28:36,244 --> 02:28:38,599
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

1839
02:28:40,804 --> 02:28:42,715
Jesus, that was short.

1840
02:28:45,284 --> 02:28:48,560
- Move 'em up!
- All right, full power!
Full power! Here we go!

1841
02:28:50,804 --> 02:28:52,522
Come on!

1842
02:29:03,164 --> 02:29:05,120
Come on! Here we go!
Here we go!

1843
02:29:16,644 --> 02:29:17,679
We made it!

1844
02:29:35,164 --> 02:29:39,362
From Berlin, Rome and Tokyo,
we have been described...

1845
02:29:39,444 --> 02:29:42,277
as a nation
ofweaklings and playboys...

1846
02:29:42,364 --> 02:29:45,879
who hire British orRussian
orChinesesoldiers...

1847
02:29:45,964 --> 02:29:48,319
to do ourfighting forus.

1848
02:29:48,404 --> 02:29:51,123
Let them repeat that now.

1849
02:29:51,204 --> 02:29:54,560
Let them tell that
to General MacArthur and his men.

1850
02:29:54,644 --> 02:29:58,239
Let them tellthat
to thesoldiers who today...

1851
02:29:58,324 --> 02:30:01,953
are fightinghard
in the far waters ofthe Pacific.

1852
02:30:02,044 --> 02:30:06,037
Let them tell that
to the boys in the Flying Fortresses.

1853
02:30:06,124 --> 02:30:08,843
Let them tell that
to the marines.

1854
02:30:10,284 --> 02:30:14,516
That'sJapan right there, fellas.
Tighten up back there. Man your guns!

1855
02:30:16,004 --> 02:30:18,837
We're in the enemy's backyard.

1856
02:30:18,924 --> 02:30:21,597
All right,
look alive back there. I see coastline.

1857
02:30:28,364 --> 02:30:29,956
Heads up, boys! Heads up!

1858
02:30:35,124 --> 02:30:38,355
- Man your guns back there.
- I'm cocked and locked!

1859
02:30:38,444 --> 02:30:39,797
Get ready, you suckers.

1860
02:30:47,564 --> 02:30:52,558
Approaching targets for bombing raid.
Open bomb bay doors.
Open bomb bay doors.

1861
02:30:52,644 --> 02:30:55,477
Ripley, you got
our target in sight?

1862
02:30:55,564 --> 02:30:57,282
37 degrees. Target in sight.

1863
02:31:06,084 --> 02:31:08,234
All right, boys,
let's knock their clocks off!

1864
02:31:08,324 --> 02:31:10,280
- Drop your ordnance.
- Bombs away.

1865
02:31:10,364 --> 02:31:12,161
One away!

1866
02:31:12,244 --> 02:31:14,314
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!

1867
02:31:14,404 --> 02:31:15,996
Two away!

1868
02:31:24,604 --> 02:31:26,162
Three away! Four away!

1869
02:31:30,604 --> 02:31:33,357
- We caught 'em bysurprise.
- Dropping ordnance.

1870
02:31:33,444 --> 02:31:35,162
Bombsaway!Bombsaway!

1871
02:31:35,244 --> 02:31:37,360
Factories.Just factories.

1872
02:31:42,564 --> 02:31:44,282
- We got it!
- We got it!

1873
02:31:44,364 --> 02:31:46,320
We hit our targets.
Good job, Raiders.

1874
02:32:03,684 --> 02:32:05,436
We got flak everywhere.

1875
02:32:07,564 --> 02:32:10,715
- Go down there and get Gooz!
- I want everyone to separate!

1876
02:32:10,804 --> 02:32:12,795
- Clean that up.
- Yes, sir.

1877
02:32:12,884 --> 02:32:15,034
- Try and clean that up.
- They're shooting flakat us!

1878
02:32:26,924 --> 02:32:29,643
We gotta try
and get out ofthis shit, Gooz.

1879
02:32:31,724 --> 02:32:34,955
We got a fire!
We got a fire!

1880
02:32:35,044 --> 02:32:38,002
It's an electric fi--
We got a fire back here!

1881
02:32:38,084 --> 02:32:40,075
I'm gonna short this out!

1882
02:32:40,164 --> 02:32:42,678
Get into the clouds. Danny.
right now! Get up--

1883
02:32:56,364 --> 02:32:57,592
Goddam it!

1884
02:32:58,884 --> 02:33:00,158
Red, go check it out.

1885
02:33:05,844 --> 02:33:08,597
- I'm getting peppered up here!
-Just hope they don't hit a prop.

1886
02:33:13,724 --> 02:33:16,079
- I'm hit!
- They're gonna tear this plane apart.

1887
02:33:17,764 --> 02:33:19,641
We gotta take it up. 800 feet.

1888
02:33:23,884 --> 02:33:27,513
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up! Theo!

1889
02:33:29,204 --> 02:33:31,877
Get into the clouds, Danny,
right now. Get up in that soup!

1890
02:33:31,964 --> 02:33:34,000
All right, we're gonna pull out
ofthis, Gooz. Come on.

1891
02:33:46,524 --> 02:33:48,754
Thankyou, George.

1892
02:33:52,684 --> 02:33:54,003
What is it, General?

1893
02:33:54,084 --> 02:33:58,600
Colonel Doolittle had
to advance his execution order
by 1 2 hours, Mr President.

1894
02:33:58,684 --> 02:34:00,197
There'll be no homing beacons.

1895
02:34:00,284 --> 02:34:02,844
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China.

1896
02:34:02,924 --> 02:34:06,121
And our bombers may lack the fuel
to reach the mainland anyway, sir.

1897
02:34:06,204 --> 02:34:10,959
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.

1898
02:34:13,364 --> 02:34:15,753
God help them.

1899
02:34:22,764 --> 02:34:25,756
Still not getting a signal.

1900
02:34:25,844 --> 02:34:29,723
All ocean, no land.
Homing into nothing.

1901
02:34:31,724 --> 02:34:33,999
How many cans offuel
we got left?

1902
02:34:34,084 --> 02:34:36,644
These are all empty!

1903
02:34:36,724 --> 02:34:40,239
- Is this all you got?
- That's all we got, Red.

1904
02:34:40,324 --> 02:34:44,237
Rafe, you better pray for land.

1905
02:34:48,044 --> 02:34:49,363
Break radio silence.

1906
02:34:51,084 --> 02:34:53,803
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1907
02:34:53,884 --> 02:34:55,636
You're all brave souls...

1908
02:34:55,724 --> 02:34:58,761
among the bravest I've everhad
theprivilege offlying with.

1909
02:34:59,764 --> 02:35:02,642
But we're on our own.

1910
02:35:06,244 --> 02:35:09,156
This really was
a suicide mission.

1911
02:35:23,524 --> 02:35:27,233
- Engine one's fluctuating.
- We're gonna lose it any minute.

1912
02:35:28,484 --> 02:35:30,998
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I'm priming it. How about now?

1913
02:35:35,084 --> 02:35:37,678
I see the coastline.
I see the coast!

1914
02:35:38,764 --> 02:35:40,277
Copy that, Rafe.

1915
02:35:40,364 --> 02:35:41,956
- We're gonna make it.
- Yeah.

1916
02:35:42,044 --> 02:35:43,841
Danny, follow me now.
We can make this.

1917
02:35:43,924 --> 02:35:46,518
I can see the coast right now.
It's only a few miles out. Follow me.

1918
02:35:46,604 --> 02:35:49,164
We're following you, Rafe.
We gotta find a soft landing spot.

1919
02:35:49,244 --> 02:35:50,836
I'm pushing up on two.

1920
02:35:50,924 --> 02:35:53,040
Fellas, it's gonna be
a hard landing. Hold on.

1921
02:35:53,124 --> 02:35:56,036
I see rice paddies right there.
We'll bring it in right here.

1922
02:35:58,524 --> 02:36:00,276
Oh, God. Engine one's dead.

1923
02:36:00,364 --> 02:36:02,559
We're gonna lose
engine two any second.

1924
02:36:06,004 --> 02:36:08,882
We can make it in.
Easy. Pull it back.

1925
02:36:08,964 --> 02:36:11,080
We'll glide in,
go in on fumes.

1926
02:36:13,404 --> 02:36:16,635
Japs! We gotJap patrols
all over the place!

1927
02:36:16,724 --> 02:36:19,192
There'sJaps everywhere!
Danny. Iandsomewhere else!

1928
02:36:19,284 --> 02:36:21,559
Strap yourself in, boys!
We're coming in hard!

1929
02:36:21,644 --> 02:36:24,681
- We're a dead stick.
- Get out ofthe nose!

1930
02:36:25,924 --> 02:36:29,155
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!

1931
02:36:30,244 --> 02:36:31,518
Watch the trees!

1932
02:36:40,604 --> 02:36:41,639
Oh, God!

1933
02:36:54,484 --> 02:36:56,156
Everyone all right?

1934
02:36:57,524 --> 02:37:00,482
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1935
02:37:00,564 --> 02:37:02,919
Where's Ripley?

1936
02:37:03,004 --> 02:37:05,279
He's dead.

1937
02:37:05,364 --> 02:37:07,116
Watch forJaps.

1938
02:37:15,684 --> 02:37:18,039
Jap patrols! Take cover!

1939
02:37:34,804 --> 02:37:36,715
- Who's got extra magazines?
- I got 'em.

1940
02:37:36,804 --> 02:37:39,796
We got to get up into those hills
and find the Chinese.

1941
02:37:44,244 --> 02:37:45,996
They got us pinned down!

1942
02:37:56,444 --> 02:37:57,797
- Danny!
- Rafe!

1943
02:37:57,884 --> 02:37:59,556
- Rafe, no! Rafe!
- Danny!

1944
02:38:00,844 --> 02:38:03,642
You don't have a chance!
Rafe!

1945
02:38:05,764 --> 02:38:07,959
Oh, God. Dan-- Danny!

1946
02:38:08,044 --> 02:38:09,955
Come on!

1947
02:38:12,484 --> 02:38:16,113
- Gooz? You okay, man?
- Danny!

1948
02:38:16,204 --> 02:38:18,399
Oh, shit. Anthony.

1949
02:38:18,484 --> 02:38:20,042
Gooz!

1950
02:38:20,124 --> 02:38:23,082
- Can you hear me? Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1951
02:38:25,484 --> 02:38:28,442
- Danny. Easy, easy, easy.
- I've had better landings.

1952
02:38:28,524 --> 02:38:31,436
- You saved us back there.
- I got something in my neck.

1953
02:38:31,524 --> 02:38:33,480
- Let me try to pull this out foryou.
- Where's Gooz?

1954
02:38:33,564 --> 02:38:36,397
He's fine.
He's right over there.

1955
02:38:52,724 --> 02:38:53,839
Rafe!

1956
02:39:51,564 --> 02:39:52,440
Grenade!

1957
02:40:02,084 --> 02:40:03,642
Danny.

1958
02:40:03,724 --> 02:40:05,396
Danny!

1959
02:40:05,484 --> 02:40:07,634
Danny. Oh!

1960
02:40:10,524 --> 02:40:12,480
- Hold on.Just hold on one second.
- Rafe.

1961
02:40:12,564 --> 02:40:16,603
Hold on now. I got you.
You're all right.
You're all right. There you go.

1962
02:40:16,684 --> 02:40:19,039
I'm not--
I'm not gonna make it.

1963
02:40:22,924 --> 02:40:25,802
Oh, yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Danny, look at me.

1964
02:40:25,884 --> 02:40:27,363
Rafe.

1965
02:40:27,444 --> 02:40:30,242
I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

1966
02:40:31,324 --> 02:40:33,235
You're all right. Hey.

1967
02:40:37,724 --> 02:40:39,919
Hey, Rafe?

1968
02:40:40,004 --> 02:40:42,757
- Can you do me a favour?
- What?

1969
02:40:42,844 --> 02:40:47,395
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?

1970
02:40:47,484 --> 02:40:50,203
You're not gonna die. Look at me.
Listen to me. You ain't gonna die.

1971
02:40:50,284 --> 02:40:53,356
You hear me? Danny.

1972
02:40:53,444 --> 02:40:55,799
Danny, you can't die.
You can't die.

1973
02:40:55,884 --> 02:40:58,444
You know why? 'Cause
you're gonna be a father, Danny.

1974
02:40:59,684 --> 02:41:02,756
You're gonna be a daddy.
I was-- I wasn't supposed to tell you.

1975
02:41:04,844 --> 02:41:06,755
You're gonna be a father.

1976
02:41:09,004 --> 02:41:10,517
Please.

1977
02:41:14,564 --> 02:41:16,043
No, you are.

1978
02:41:25,524 --> 02:41:26,843
Danny.

1979
02:41:29,244 --> 02:41:31,280
Danny?

1980
02:41:31,364 --> 02:41:32,843
Danny?

1981
02:41:32,924 --> 02:41:36,314
Please. Please. Please.

1982
02:41:39,524 --> 02:41:41,719
God.

1983
02:41:41,804 --> 02:41:44,318
Please, Danny.

1984
02:41:53,724 --> 02:41:56,796
Hold your fire. They're Chinese.

1985
02:43:14,444 --> 02:43:17,720
When the action is over
and we look back...

1986
02:43:17,804 --> 02:43:20,443
we understand both more and less.

1987
02:43:20,524 --> 02:43:22,799
This much is certain.

1988
02:43:22,884 --> 02:43:26,797
Before the Doolittle raid,
America knew nothing but defeat.

1989
02:43:26,884 --> 02:43:30,274
After it,
there was hope ofvictory.

1990
02:43:30,364 --> 02:43:34,562
Japan realized, for the first time, that
they could lose and began to pull back.

1991
02:43:34,644 --> 02:43:38,319
America realized that she would win
and surged forward.

1992
02:43:38,404 --> 02:43:42,920
It was a war that changed
America and the world.

1993
02:43:43,004 --> 02:43:46,883
Dorie Miller was the first black
American to be awarded the Navy Cross.

1994
02:43:46,964 --> 02:43:51,116
But he would not be the last.
Hejoined a brotherhood of heroes.

1995
02:43:57,964 --> 02:44:00,603
That's for all the Raiders.

1996
02:44:09,164 --> 02:44:12,918
World War ll, for us,
began at Pearl Harbor...

1997
02:44:13,004 --> 02:44:17,714
and 1 ,1 77 men still lie entombed
in the battleship Arizona.

1998
02:44:19,004 --> 02:44:23,361
America suffered,
but America grew stronger.

1999
02:44:23,444 --> 02:44:25,435
It was not inevitable.

2000
02:44:25,524 --> 02:44:28,243
The times tried our souls...

2001
02:44:28,324 --> 02:44:31,634
and through the trial,
we overcame.

2002
02:44:51,124 --> 02:44:54,355
Hey, Danny.
How'd you like to go flying?

2003
02:44:56,004 --> 02:44:57,915
Come here.

2004
02:46:01,484 --> 02:46:04,920
When lthinkback on these times

2005
02:46:05,004 --> 02:46:08,553
