1
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,461
<i>Dearest, I feel certain</i>

2
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,379
<i>that I am going mad again.</i>

3
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,797
<i>I feel we can't go</i>

4
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,924
<i>through another
of these terrible times,</i>

5
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,176
<i>and I... shan't</i>

6
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,596
<i>recover this time.</i>

7
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:50,142
<i>I begin to hear voices,
and can't concentrate.</i>

8
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,397
<i>So, I am doing
what seems to be</i>

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,440
<i>the best thing to do.</i>

10
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,123
<i>You have given me</i>

11
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:18,043
<i>the greatest possible
happiness.</i>

12
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,628
<i>You have been in every way</i>

13
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:23,005
<i>all that anyone could be.</i>

14
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:29,803
<i>I know
that I am spoiling your life,</i>

15
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,556
<i>and without me,
you could work.</i>

16
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,683
<i>And you will,</i>

17
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,643
<i>I know.</i>

18
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,149
<i>You see, I can't
even write this properly.</i>

19
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:48,195
<i>What I want to say
is that I owe</i>

20
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:50,948
<i>all the happiness
of my life to you.</i>

21
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:53,992
<i>You have been entirely patient
with me...</i>

22
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,495
<i>and</i>

23
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:00,331
<i>incredibly good.</i>

24
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:01,666
<i>Everything's gone</i>

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,418
<i>from me but the certainty</i>

26
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:07,046
<i>of your goodness.</i>

27
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,965
<i>I can't go on
spoiling your life any longer.</i>

28
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:15,929
<i>I don't think two people
could have been happier</i>

29
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,473
<i>than we have been.</i>

30
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,099
<i>Virginia.</i>

31
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,124
Good morning, Doctor.

32
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,625
Mr. Woolf.

33
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,836
No worse, I think.

34
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,838
I see.

35
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:28,008
The main thing is to keep her
where she is, and calm.

36
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:31,428
Friday, then.

37
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,247
Good morning, Leonard.

38
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,581
Good morning, Virginia.

39
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:05,999
How was your sleep ?

40
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,667
Uneventful.

41
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:09,461
The headaches ?

42
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:13,381
No. No headaches.

43
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,841
Doctor seemed pleased.

44
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:17,551
That's all from this morning ?

45
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:20,054
Yes. This young man
has submitted his manuscript.

46
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:21,680
I've found three errors of fact

47
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:23,682
and two spelling mistakes,

48
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:26,268
and I'm not yet on page four.

49
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:28,353
Have you had breakfast ?

50
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,479
Yes.

51
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,688
Liar.

52
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:32,774
Virginia, it's not
my insistence.

53
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:35,193
It's your own doctor's.

54
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:37,903
I'm going to send

55
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:41,407
Nelly up with some fruit
and a bun.

56
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,200
Right. Lunch, then.

57
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:44,243
Proper lunch,

58
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:46,995
husband and wife
sitting down together...

59
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,371
soup, pudding

60
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,206
and all.

61
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,584
By force if necessary.

62
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,879
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.

63
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:04,428
Work, then.

64
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,269
Then you must eat.

65
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:14,283
Mrs. Dalloway said...

66
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:20,789
she would buy the flowers...
herself.

67
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:22,082
<i>Mrs. Dalloway said</i>

68
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:25,418
<i>she would buy the flowers
herself.</i>

69
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,298
Sally, I think I'll buy
the flowers myself.

70
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:32,508
What ?

71
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,677
What flowers ?

72
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,471
Oh, shit. I forgot.

73
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,307
You're never going
to be a big boy

74
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,517
if you don't eat
your breakfast.

75
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:43,977
You're going to be
the big brother.

76
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,103
It's a very important job.

77
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,313
Happy birthday.

78
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:48,064
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, Dan.

79
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,733
Roses on your own birthday.

80
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,151
You're too much.
Really.

81
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,694
He'll eat it

82
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:54,820
now that you're here.

83
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:57,156
It's your birthday.

84
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,824
You shouldn't be out
buying me flowers.

85
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,492
Well, you were still sleeping.

86
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:02,244
So ?

87
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:04,246
Well, we decided
it would be better

88
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,206
if we let you sleep in
a little, didn't we ?

89
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,499
Morning, bug.

90
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,503
You need to rest, Laura.

91
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,171
You're only four months away.

92
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:15,339
Dan, don't.

93
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,882
I'm fine.

94
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:18,884
I'm just tired.

95
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,262
I've been telling him
he's got to eat his breakfast.

96
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,513
That's true.

97
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,307
So, it's a beautiful day.

98
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,725
What are you two going
to be doing with it ?

99
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:31,437
We've got our plans,
don't we ?

100
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,688
What plans ?

101
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,065
Hmm...

102
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,775
Well, it wouldn't
be much of a party,

103
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:37,818
would it, if I told you

104
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:38,944
every detail in advance ?

105
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,195
Well, I better just stop

106
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,863
asking questions then, huh ?

107
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:44,157
That the time ?

108
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,533
I better get going.

109
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:46,534
Have a good day.

110
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:47,660
You, too.

111
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,915
Dan, happy birthday.

112
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,125
Oh, thank you.

113
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,949
You need to finish
your breakfast.

114
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,766
Oh, I'm going to make a cake.

115
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:03,104
That's what I'm going to do.

116
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm going to make the cake
for Daddy's birthday.

117
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:06,816
Mommy, can I help ?

118
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:09,277
Can I help make the cake ?

119
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:12,488
Of course you can, sweet pea.

120
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:15,991
I'm not going to do
anything without you.

121
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,076
No, of course.

122
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,869
You have to come.

123
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:22,164
Of course.

124
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,290
Well, I always wanted you

125
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:25,333
and everybody involved
in the actual ceremony.

126
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,126
I don't know.

127
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,586
Around 60.

128
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,046
Well, it will.

129
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:31,964
It'll mean so much.

130
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:33,299
The whole occasion.

131
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,384
It's the least I can do

132
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,469
to have a nice dinner
and say thank you

133
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,637
to everybody.

134
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,305
You've done so much for him.

135
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,848
Oh, I take that as a yes.

136
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,475
He'll be thrilled.

137
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:44,809
Oh, my God.

138
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:48,021
I'm thrilled.
Oh, good.

139
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,480
What if nobody comes ?

140
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,232
This is Clarissa Vaughan.

141
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,609
Yes, I am just confirming

142
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,986
that you're sending a car
to pick me up first.

143
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,362
Yeah.

144
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,031
- Hi, Clarissa.
- Hi, can't talk.

145
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:01,741
And then we're
going over to 679 Hudson,

146
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,702
which is at 9th and 14th.

147
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:07,413
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us.

148
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,081
And it'll be over at seven.

149
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:21,218
Flowers !
What a beautiful morning.

150
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,219
Hi, Clarissa.
How are you ?

151
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,722
I'm having a party.

152
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:28,766
My friend Richard's won
the Carruthers.

153
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,226
Well, that's just terrific...

154
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:32,812
if I knew what it was.

155
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:36,565
It's a poetry prize
for a life's work.

156
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,484
It's the most prestigious.

157
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:40,986
For a poet,
it's the best you can do.

158
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:42,279
Oh, very good.

159
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,114
So, what would you like ?

160
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:46,032
The lilies are perfect.

161
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:49,202
No. Too morbid.

162
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:50,328
Hydrangeas, I think.

163
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:51,829
And, um...

164
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:55,958
Oh, oh, let's just have
buckets of roses.

165
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:02,589
And... I think I'm going
to take these with me.

166
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:03,423
Rodney ?

167
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,966
Okay.

168
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,009
Thank you.

169
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,554
I actually tried
to read Richard's novel.

170
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,557
You did ?

171
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,436
Oh, I know. It's not easy.

172
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,645
I know.

173
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,189
It did take him
ten years to write.

174
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,234
Maybe it just takes
another ten to read.

175
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,112
It's you, isn't it ?

176
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,572
What is ?

177
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,115
In the novel,
isn't it meant to be you ?

178
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,909
Oh, I see.

179
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,452
Yeah.

180
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,954
Sort of.

181
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,455
I mean, in a way.

182
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:39,789
You know, Richard's a writer.

183
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,124
That's what he is.

184
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,709
He uses things
which actually happen.

185
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,210
Yeah.

186
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,588
And years ago,
he and I were students.

187
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:48,756
That's true.

188
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,341
But, you know,
then he changes things.

189
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,217
Oh, sure.

190
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,427
I don't mean in a bad way.

191
00:16:57,556 --> 00:17:01,309
It's more like...
he makes them his own.

192
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:13,404
A woman's whole life...

193
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:16,823
in a single day,

194
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:20,744
just one day...

195
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:23,705
and in that day,

196
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,748
her whole life.

197
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,627
This is what we need.

198
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,128
Shortening...

199
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,394
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

200
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:35,771
Yes, it's me !

201
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:38,356
Oh... It's me.

202
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,649
Come in.

203
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:44,445
Richard,
it's a beautiful morning.

204
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,990
How about we let in
a little more light ?

205
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:49,825
Is it still morning ?

206
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,785
Yes, it is.

207
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,037
Have I died ?

208
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:58,249
Good morning, my dear.

209
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,295
Any visitors ?

210
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:03,337
Yes.

211
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:04,547
Are they still here ?

212
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,090
No. They've gone.

213
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,008
Mm. How'd they look ?

214
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:10,052
Today ?

215
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,179
Sort of like black fire.

216
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:14,639
I mean, sort of light

217
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:18,184
and dark at the same time.

218
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,478
There was one a bit
like an electrified jellyfish.

219
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,940
They were singing.

220
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:25,524
May have been Greek.

221
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:29,653
So the ceremony is at 5:00.

222
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:30,988
Do you remember ?

223
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:38,536
And then...

224
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,997
the party is right after.

225
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,965
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they ?

226
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,801
What a question. Of course.

227
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:55,886
Richard, you did eat it ?

228
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,304
Well, can you see it ?

229
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,556
Is it here ?

230
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,598
Any breakfast lying around ?

231
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,017
No, I don't see it.

232
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,852
Well, then I must have
eaten it, mustn't I ?

233
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,313
I suppose.

234
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:08,439
Does it matter ?

235
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:11,441
Of course, it matters.

236
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:14,903
You know what the doctors say.

237
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:24,078
Have you been skipping pills ?

238
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,454
Clarissa, I can't take this.

239
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,455
Take what ?

240
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:27,790
Having to be proud and brave

241
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:29,291
in front of everybody.

242
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,460
Oh. Honey, it's not
a performance.

243
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:32,586
Of course it is.

244
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,880
I got the prize
for my performance.

245
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:35,922
Well, that is
nonsense.

246
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:38,133
I got the prize for having AIDS
and going nuts

247
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:39,384
and being brave about it.

248
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,803
I actually got the prize
for having come through.

249
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:43,638
It's not true.

250
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:45,264
- For surviving, that's what
- It's not true.

251
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:46,807
I got the prize for.
Oh, you think they

252
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:47,975
would have given it to me
if I were healthy ?

253
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:50,018
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

254
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,028
Is it here somewhere ?

255
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:01,029
What ?

256
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,530
The prize.
I'd like to look at it.

257
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:09,078
No, you haven't gotten it yet.

258
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,831
It's tonight.

259
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:14,457
Are you sure ?

260
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,710
Um...

261
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,003
I remember
the ceremony perfectly.

262
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,632
I seem to have
fallen out of time.

263
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:28,387
Richard.

264
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,181
Richard...

265
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,974
it's a party,

266
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,352
and it's only a party.

267
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,646
Hmm ? Populated entirely

268
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,483
by people who respect
and admire you.

269
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,068
A small party, is it ?

270
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,778
A select party, is it ?

271
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,321
Your friends.

272
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,239
I thought I lost all my friends.

273
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:51,408
I thought I drove
my friends crazy.

274
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:53,493
Jesus.

275
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,787
Oh, Mrs. Dalloway,

276
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,458
always giving parties
to cover the silence.

277
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:13,803
Richard...

278
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:19,559
You won't need to do anything.

279
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,602
All you have to do is appear,

280
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:24,772
sit on the sofa.

281
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,484
And I will be there.

282
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,028
This is a group of people

283
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:35,907
who want to tell you
your work is going to live.

284
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:37,158
Oh, is it ?

285
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:40,203
Is my work going to live ?

286
00:22:40,286 --> 00:22:42,455
I can't go through with it,
Clarissa.

287
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:45,624
Oh... Why do you say that ?

288
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,292
- I can't.
- Why ?

289
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:49,002
Because I wanted
to be a writer, that's all.

290
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:50,003
So ?

291
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,964
I wanted to write about it all.

292
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,133
Everything that happens
in a moment.

293
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:57,260
The way the flowers looked

294
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:59,053
when you carried them
in your arms.

295
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:01,430
This towel, how it... smells,
how it feels.

296
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:02,598
This thread.

297
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,267
All our feelings,

298
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,102
yours and mine.

299
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,145
The history of it,

300
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:10,897
who we once were.

301
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:12,732
Everything in the world.

302
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:17,320
Everything all mixed up...

303
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:20,198
like it's all mixed up now.

304
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:25,953
And I failed.

305
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,211
I failed.

306
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:39,132
No matter what you start with,
it ends up being so much less.

307
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,679
Sheer fucking pride...

308
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,347
and stupidity.

309
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:58,441
We want everything, don't we ?

310
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:03,070
I suppose we do.

311
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:06,323
You kissed me on a beach.

312
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:12,287
Yeah.

313
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,164
Do you remember...

314
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,835
how many years ago ?

315
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:20,086
Of course.

316
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,505
What did you want then ?

317
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,804
Come closer.

318
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,432
I'm right here.

319
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,684
Come closer, would you, please ?

320
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,316
Take my hand.

321
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,072
Would you be angry ?

322
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:55,535
Would I be angry
if you didn't show up

323
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:56,869
at the party ?

324
00:24:56,911 --> 00:25:00,247
Would you be angry if I died ?

325
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:01,540
If you died ?

326
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:03,959
Who is this party for ?

327
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,169
What do you mean, who's it for ?

328
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:08,088
What are you asking ?
What are you trying to say ?

329
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:09,881
I'm not trying to say anything.

330
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:11,049
Mm.

331
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:12,384
I'm saying...

332
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:17,597
I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.

333
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:27,981
Well...

334
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,734
so that is what we do.

335
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,569
That is what people do.

336
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:36,405
They stay alive for each other.

337
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,448
And the doctors told you,

338
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,949
you-you don't need to die.

339
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:39,950
They told you that.

340
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,537
You can... live
like this for years.

341
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,414
Well, exactly.

342
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,459
I don't accept this.

343
00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:52,420
I don't accept what you say.

344
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:53,463
Oh.

345
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:55,798
And it's for you
to decide, is it ?

346
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,342
How long have you been
doing that ?

347
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,636
How many years ?

348
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:01,971
Coming to the apartment.

349
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:05,015
What about your own life ?

350
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:07,726
What about Sally ?

351
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,104
Just wait till I die.

352
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:12,564
Then you'll have to think
of yourself.

353
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,900
How are you going to like that ?

354
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,826
Richard...

355
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,247
it would be great
if you did come to the party,

356
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,791
if you felt
well enough to come.

357
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,042
Just to let you know,

358
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,212
I am making the crab thing.

359
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:41,256
Not that I imagine
it makes any difference to you.

360
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,966
Of course,
it makes a difference.

361
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,259
I love the crab thing.

362
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:48,346
Clarissa ?

363
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,557
Yes ?

364
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:07,322
I'll be back at 3:30,

365
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,865
and I'll help you
get dressed.

366
00:27:08,949 --> 00:27:11,159
Wonderful.

367
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:13,286
3:30.

368
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,381
Wonderful.

369
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:54,824
<i>It's on this day,</i>

370
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,076
<i>this day of all days...</i>

371
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:08,378
<i>her fate becomes clear
to her.</i>

372
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,594
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.

373
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:19,013
Mr. Woolf said I was to come
and speak with you.

374
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:22,474
I've nearly finished, Nelly.

375
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:24,518
You can tell me in the kitchen.

376
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:26,102
I'll be down very soon.

377
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:33,234
Hmm.

378
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:36,695
What happens is,
she says she wants something,

379
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,239
and then it turns out
she doesn't.

380
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:39,990
Well, she never does, does she ?

381
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:41,033
She never wants anything.

382
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:42,075
Mm-hmm.

383
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:44,411
Especially when she's
particularly after it.

384
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:45,412
That's a sure sign.

385
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:46,663
I wish I'd been there.

386
00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:48,081
I wish you had, too.

387
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:50,333
Did you give her that look ?

388
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,459
That sort of look you do ?

389
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:55,838
<i>I said, Madam...</i>

390
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:04,554
Yes, Nelly, tell me.

391
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:05,764
How can I help ?

392
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:07,140
It's about lunch.

393
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:10,601
I just had
to go ahead on my own.

394
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:12,437
I understand.

395
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,233
You chose a pie ?

396
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:19,026
I chose a lamb pie.

397
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,320
That seems suitable.

398
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:24,865
You being so busy
with your writing...

399
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:29,369
I had no instructions.

400
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,997
You do remember
that my sister is coming

401
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,665
at 4:00 with the children ?

402
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:35,916
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,960
I hadn't forgotten.

404
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,630
China tea, I think.

405
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:46,593
And ginger.

406
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,805
Ginger, Madam ?

407
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,685
I'd like
to give the children a treat.

408
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,023
We'd have to go to London

409
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:02,024
for ginger, Madam.

410
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:03,400
I haven't finished this,

411
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,402
and there's the rest
of lunch

412
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:06,903
to get ready.

413
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:09,864
The 12:30 train, Nelly,
will get you

414
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:11,491
into London just after 1:00.

415
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,034
If you return on the 2:30,

416
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,703
you should be back in Richmond
soon after 3:00.

417
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:18,664
Do I miscalculate ?

418
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,916
No.

419
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,460
Well, then, is something
detaining you, Nelly ?

420
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,678
I can't think of anything
more exhilarating

421
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,888
than a trip to London.

422
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:44,896
- Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.
- Good morning.

423
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,941
We shall publish
no more new authors.

424
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:49,067
I have to tell you,

425
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,902
I've discovered ten errors
in the first proof.

426
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,570
Lucky to have found them then.

427
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:55,322
<i>Passiondale was a...</i>

428
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:56,532
<i>charnel house</i>

429
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:59,243
<i>from which no min returned.</i>

430
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:02,829
Do you think it's possible that

431
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,581
bad writing actually
attracts a higher

432
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:05,498
incidence of error ?

433
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,419
If it's all right, I thought
I might take a short walk.

434
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,381
Not far ?

435
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:14,924
No. Just for air.

436
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,886
Go then.

437
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,097
If I could walk midmorning,

438
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,556
I'd be a happy man.

439
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:35,776
She'll die.

440
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:39,279
She's going to die.

441
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,409
That's what's going to happen.

442
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:45,994
Huh.

443
00:31:46,077 --> 00:31:47,662
That's it.

444
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:55,586
She'll kill herself.

445
00:31:58,714 --> 00:32:00,757
She'll kill herself
over something

446
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:02,676
which doesn't seem to matter.

447
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,303
Let's think.

448
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:07,138
You grease the pan, Mommy.

449
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:09,307
I know you grease the pan,
sweet one.

450
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,683
Even Mommy knows that.

451
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:15,479
This is what we're going to do.

452
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:17,731
Flour...

453
00:32:17,814 --> 00:32:20,192
bowl...

454
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:21,401
sifter.

455
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:22,527
Can I do it, Mommy ?

456
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:25,196
Can you sift the flour ?

457
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:28,407
Yes, you can sift the flour,
baby,

458
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,201
if that's what makes you happy.

459
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,457
Yeah.

460
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,505
Isn't it beautiful ?

461
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,883
Don't you think
it looks like snow ?

462
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:47,884
Hmm ?

463
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:48,885
Okay.

464
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,303
Now, the next thing...

465
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,013
The next thing I'm going

466
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:56,225
to show you... uh, is...

467
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,434
we measure out the cups.

468
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,978
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

469
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,813
Now, I know.
I know it isn't difficult.

470
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,856
It's just that I...

471
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,316
I just want to do this
for Daddy.

472
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,318
Because it's his birthday ?

473
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,319
That's right.

474
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,862
We're baking the cake

475
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,864
to show him
that we love him.

476
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:14,491
Otherwise he won't know
we love him ?

477
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:19,913
That's right.

478
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,715
I got all the stuff.

479
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,050
I'm going right out again.

480
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,802
My God, what a zoo !

481
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:37,596
Why do people have to talk
about dry cleaning ?

482
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,806
I mean, what is there
to talk about ?

483
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,516
I bought you some flowers.

484
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,061
Where are you ?

485
00:33:45,144 --> 00:33:46,854
In here.

486
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:49,315
I got someone at work
to cover me.

487
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:52,610
I'll be with you all night.

488
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,283
Are you all right ?

489
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,243
Sure.

490
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:07,957
I guess you saw Richard.

491
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,333
That's right.

492
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:13,837
Well, of course.

493
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:15,839
I bet he said,

494
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,549
<i>Oh, by the way,
honey, do you mind ?</i>

495
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:18,717
<i>Can I skip the party ?</i>

496
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:22,053
Don't worry.

497
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,763
He always shows up.

498
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:24,889
Oh, sure.

499
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,057
In the end.

500
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,892
What, Richard miss an award ?

501
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:30,102
A chance to talk about his work.

502
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:31,562
I don't think so.

503
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:32,730
He'll show up.

504
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:34,523
You did the seating.

505
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,442
I did.

506
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,404
I don't believe it...
Louis Waters.

507
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,740
Is Louis coming ?

508
00:34:43,823 --> 00:34:44,907
Richard's Louis ?

509
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,325
He is.

510
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,411
You put him next to me.

511
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:52,998
Why do I always have
to sit next to the exes ?

512
00:34:53,082 --> 00:34:54,917
Is this some kind of a hint,
sweetheart ?

513
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,419
And, anyway, shouldn't
the exes have a table

514
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:00,922
of their own,
where they can all ex together

515
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:02,465
in ex-quisite agony ?

516
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:06,552
I'm off.

517
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:10,639
Try not to pass out
from excitement.

518
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,603
Clarissa...

519
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:17,938
it's going to be beautiful.

520
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,362
Thank you.

521
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:29,323
You're welcome.

522
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:39,249
Why is everything wrong ?

523
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:45,004
It didn't work.

524
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:46,088
Damn it !

525
00:35:46,172 --> 00:35:48,132
It didn't work.

526
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:52,803
Hey, Scott.

527
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,930
Hi, Mrs. Barlowe.

528
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:09,693
Mommy, Mommy, there's
someone at the door !

529
00:36:18,368 --> 00:36:19,702
Hello ?

530
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,706
Hello ? Laura ?

531
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,790
Hi, Kitty.

532
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,000
Hi. Am I interrupting ?

533
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,668
Oh, of course not. Come in.

534
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,836
Are you all right ?

535
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,462
Why, sure.

536
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:32,673
Hi, Richie.

537
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:33,840
Sit down.

538
00:36:33,882 --> 00:36:35,342
I've got coffee on.

539
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:37,177
Um, would you like some ?

540
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:38,345
Please.

541
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:39,679
Oh, look.

542
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:42,015
You made a cake.

543
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:43,349
I know.

544
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:44,517
Didn't work.

545
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,186
I thought it was going to work.

546
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,730
I thought
it would work better than that.

547
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:51,899
Oh, Laura, I don't understand

548
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:53,025
why you find it so difficult.

549
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:54,109
I don't know either.

550
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,360
Anyone can make a cake.

551
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:56,361
I know.

552
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:57,487
Everyone can.

553
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,197
It's ridiculously easy.

554
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:02,325
Like, I bet you didn't
even grease the pan.

555
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:04,035
I greased the pan.

556
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,119
All right.

557
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:06,287
You know, you have

558
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,664
other virtues... and
Dan loves you so much,

559
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:09,998
he won't even notice.

560
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:11,125
Whatever you do,

561
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,543
he's going to say
it's wonderful.

562
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:14,878
Well, it's true.

563
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,506
Does Ray have a birthday ?

564
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,467
Sure he does.

565
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:22,552
When is it ?

566
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:23,761
September.

567
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:25,262
We go to the country club.

568
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,139
We always go
to the country club.

569
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:30,059
We drink martinis and spend
the day with 50 people.

570
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:31,685
Ray's got a lot of friends.

571
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:34,146
He does.

572
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,772
You both have a lot of friends.

573
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:36,815
You're good at it.

574
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,152
How is Ray ?

575
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,196
I haven't seen him in a while.

576
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:44,363
Ray's fine.

577
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:45,573
Mmm.

578
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:47,741
These guys are
something, aren't they ?

579
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:49,076
You can say that again.

580
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:51,161
They came home from the war.

581
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:53,455
They deserved it, didn't they ?

582
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,790
After what they'd
been through.

583
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,584
What... did they deserve ?

584
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,835
I don't know.

585
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:01,963
Us, I guess.

586
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,923
All this.

587
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:06,675
Oh.

588
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,677
You're reading a book.

589
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:09,928
Yeah.

590
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,181
What's this one about ?

591
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,516
Oh, it's about...

592
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,310
this woman who's incredibly...

593
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:20,605
Well, she's a hostess, and
she's incredibly confident,

594
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:22,815
and she's going to give a party,

595
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:25,276
and maybe because
she's confident,

596
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:28,320
everyone thinks she's fine...

597
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:29,905
but she isn't.

598
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,665
So.

599
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,125
Well.

600
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,506
Kitty, what is it ?

601
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,383
Is something wrong ?

602
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:55,470
I, uh... I have
to go into the hospital

603
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:56,721
for a couple of days.

604
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:58,473
Kitty.

605
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:02,977
Yeah. I have, um...

606
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:05,271
some kind of... growth,
in my uterus,

607
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:07,981
and they're going to go in
and take a look.

608
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:08,982
When ?

609
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:11,360
This afternoon.

610
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,821
Well, I need you
to feed the dog.

611
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:17,991
Of course.

612
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:38,384
Is that what you
came here to ask ?

613
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:43,973
What did the doctor
say exactly ?

614
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:48,352
Well, it's probably
what the trouble's been.

615
00:39:48,393 --> 00:39:50,854
About getting pregnant.

616
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:54,899
The thing is...

617
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,359
I mean, you know,

618
00:39:56,401 --> 00:39:59,320
I've been...
really happy with Ray.

619
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:06,243
And now it turns out
there was a reason.

620
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,206
There was a reason
I couldn't conceive.

621
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:17,378
You're lucky, Laura.

622
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,672
I don't think you
can call yourself a woman

623
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:20,923
until you're a mother.

624
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:29,389
The joke is...

625
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:31,266
all my life
I could do everything.

626
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:35,979
I mean, I could
do anything, really.

627
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:40,733
Except the one thing I wanted.

628
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,610
Yes.

629
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:44,987
That's all.

630
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,782
Well, at least now they'll
be able to deal with it.

631
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,867
That's right.
That's what they're doing.

632
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:51,952
That's right.

633
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,411
Mm. I'm not worried.

634
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,955
What would be
the point of worrying ?

635
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,957
No, it's not in your hands.

636
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,333
But that's it.

637
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:03,879
It's in the hands of some
physician I've never even met.

638
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:07,591
Some surgeon who probably
drinks more martinis

639
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,675
than Ray and...

640
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:09,718
Oh, Kitty.

641
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,345
I'm mean, of course I'm worried
about Ray.

642
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,221
Come here.

643
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,514
I'm doing fine.

644
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,515
Really.

645
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,641
I know. I know you are.

646
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,017
I'm more worried about Ray.

647
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,269
If anything,
he's not good with this stuff.

648
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,938
Forget about him, hmm ?

649
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,398
Just forget about Ray.

650
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,087
You're sweet.

651
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:56,344
You know the routine, right ?

652
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:58,763
Half a can
in the evening, and...

653
00:41:58,846 --> 00:42:00,973
check the water now and then,

654
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:04,018
and Ray will feed
him in the morning.

655
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:11,733
Kitty, you didn't mind ?

656
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:16,821
What ?

657
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:17,864
I didn't mind what ?

658
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,749
Do you want me to drive you ?

659
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:36,380
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.

660
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:42,761
Kitty, it's going to be
all right.

661
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:47,265
Of course it is.

662
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:51,770
Bye.

663
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:13,915
What ?

664
00:43:13,998 --> 00:43:15,208
What do you want ?

665
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,726
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell
has arrived.

666
00:43:38,229 --> 00:43:39,939
Not due till 4:00.

667
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:43,025
I can't help it.
She's here.

668
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:51,741
You look a perfect angel.

669
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:54,035
Don't let the boys
make fun of you.

670
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:55,703
Fly away, fly.

671
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,541
Virginia.

672
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,670
Leonard thinks it's
the end of civilization...

673
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:07,756
people who are invited
at 4:00 and arrive at 2:30.

674
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,175
Oh, God.

675
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:12,677
Barbarians.

676
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,598
Well, we finished lunch
sooner than we imagined.

677
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:24,104
I've had to send Nelly off
to London for sugar ginger.

678
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:26,731
Oh, Virginia.

679
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:30,944
You're not still frightened
of the servants, are you ?

680
00:44:30,985 --> 00:44:32,320
Come on.

681
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:37,241
And how are you, sister ?

682
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:39,451
Frantic.

683
00:44:39,535 --> 00:44:41,328
It's been ridiculous in London.

684
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,288
Ridiculous ? How ?

685
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,791
Busy.

686
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:49,919
Why is busy ridiculous ?

687
00:44:50,003 --> 00:44:53,589
I would have invited you
to our party,

688
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:54,799
but I knew you wouldn't come.

689
00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:56,300
Did you ?
How did you know that ?

690
00:44:58,093 --> 00:45:00,346
I thought
you never came to town.

691
00:45:01,805 --> 00:45:04,182
That's because
you no longer ask me.

692
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,813
Are you not forbidden to come ?

693
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,482
Do the doctors not forbid it ?

694
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:14,609
Oh, the doctors.

695
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,987
Do you not pay heed
to your doctors ?

696
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,240
Not when they're a bunch
of contemptible Victorians.

697
00:45:21,323 --> 00:45:23,450
So... what are you saying ?

698
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:27,078
Are you feeling better ?

699
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:29,664
Has this vastness
made you stronger ?

700
00:45:29,747 --> 00:45:33,668
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even
crazy people like to be asked.

701
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:37,338
Nessa ! Nessa !

702
00:45:37,463 --> 00:45:39,673
Hello, changelings.

703
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:41,425
What have you got ?

704
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:42,676
What have you found ?

705
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,177
We found a bird.

706
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:45,804
Did you ?

707
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:46,846
Yes.

708
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:48,515
Where did you find that ?

709
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:50,516
I think it must have
fallen from a tree.

710
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:51,976
Oh, my goodness.

711
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,686
Just look at him.

712
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:56,021
We might be able to save him.

713
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:57,565
Save him ?

714
00:45:57,648 --> 00:46:00,776
I think you have
to be careful, Quentin.

715
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:01,818
There's a time to die,

716
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:03,195
and it may be
the bird's time.

717
00:46:03,278 --> 00:46:05,197
Come on, let's pick some grass

718
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,823
to make a grave.

719
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,867
- Oh, Julian.
- I'm just saying.

720
00:46:08,908 --> 00:46:10,618
Then at least there'll be
a bed for him to die on.

721
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:13,871
Come on, Nessa,
let's make a grave.

722
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:16,999
Nessa, come on !

723
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:18,292
Oh...

724
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:20,169
Very well, I'm coming.

725
00:46:20,252 --> 00:46:21,461
Wait for me then.

726
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,131
Angelica, will
you be all right ?

727
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,215
Stay with your aunt.

728
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:27,425
You're going too fast.

729
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,194
Do you think she'd like roses ?

730
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:57,911
Is it a she ?

731
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:01,832
Yes, the females are larger.

732
00:47:01,915 --> 00:47:05,669
And less colorful.

733
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:08,504
What happens when we die ?

734
00:47:08,588 --> 00:47:10,340
What happens ?

735
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:18,889
We return to the place
that we came from.

736
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:21,850
I don't remember
where I came from.

737
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:23,393
Nor do I.

738
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:30,233
She looks very small.

739
00:47:31,692 --> 00:47:33,444
Yes.

740
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:36,113
Yes, that's one
of the things that happens...

741
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:39,741
we look smaller.

742
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:43,078
But very peaceful.

743
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:57,091
Oh, is it done ?

744
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,384
Have we finished ?

745
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:01,386
Is the bird funeral complete ?

746
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,387
Yes.

747
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:03,805
Very well, then.

748
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:06,724
Are we to be denied tea
altogether for coming so early ?

749
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:08,184
No, of course not.

750
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:09,394
Good.

751
00:48:09,477 --> 00:48:12,521
Come on, Angelica.

752
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:13,898
Come on, come on, boys.

753
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:14,982
Let's get some tea.

754
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:16,984
Nessa, tell him to stop it !

755
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:19,278
Now stop it, Julian.

756
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:30,288
Virginia, we're going in.

757
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,581
Virginia !

758
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:50,987
Hey, bug.

759
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,197
I've got this idea.

760
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,657
We're going
to make another cake.

761
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:59,244
We're going to make
a better one.

762
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:00,829
What happened
to the first one ?

763
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,002
And after that...

764
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:10,755
I think we should go out.

765
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:22,807
Yes ?

766
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:25,059
Clarissa, it's Louis.

767
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:26,602
Louis Waters.

768
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:29,522
Louis ? Oh, my God.

769
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:30,523
You're early.

770
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:31,565
Do you mind ?

771
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,233
Is it all right ?

772
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:53,752
Oh, why should I mind ?

773
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:54,920
I'm delighted !

774
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:56,546
Well, now !

775
00:50:59,508 --> 00:51:01,384
I feel like I'm interrupting.

776
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:02,385
Oh, why ?!

777
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:03,887
No.

778
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,763
I know the ceremony
isn't until 5:00,

779
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:07,098
but I flew in this morning.

780
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:12,478
Oh, well, Richard's
going to be thrilled.

781
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:15,022
He'll be thrilled
to see you.

782
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,064
You think so ?

783
00:51:16,148 --> 00:51:17,649
Of course.

784
00:51:24,072 --> 00:51:26,407
What are we doing ?
We should go in.

785
00:51:34,832 --> 00:51:36,249
Are you all right ?

786
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,959
Yes. It's nothing.

787
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:39,836
It's just the party.

788
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,421
Oh, right.

789
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:46,217
Oh, wow !

790
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,218
It's looking beautiful.

791
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:48,969
Thanks.

792
00:51:49,053 --> 00:51:49,762
Are you still with... ?

793
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:50,804
Yes, I am.

794
00:51:50,888 --> 00:51:52,806
Still with her. Ten years.

795
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:54,766
It's crazy.

796
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,893
Why is it crazy ?

797
00:51:56,977 --> 00:51:58,645
No reason.

798
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:00,230
Would you like something
to drink ?

799
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:01,940
Some water.

800
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:02,857
Okay.

801
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,874
Are you still an editor ?

802
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:23,167
Oh, sure.

803
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:24,585
With the same publisher ?

804
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,296
Mm-hmm.

805
00:52:27,421 --> 00:52:29,215
How's San Francisco ?

806
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:33,343
Oh, it's one of those cities
people tell you to like.

807
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,942
Richard said he thought

808
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:51,068
you were happy out there.

809
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:52,069
Oh, great.

810
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:54,112
So now the illness
makes him psychic.

811
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,575
You have to prepare
yourself, Louis.

812
00:52:58,617 --> 00:53:00,952
He's very changed.

813
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,164
I read the book.

814
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,415
Oh, God...

815
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:08,417
Exactly.

816
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:10,252
I thought you were
meant to do more

817
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:11,920
than just change people's names.

818
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:12,963
Well...

819
00:53:13,046 --> 00:53:15,257
Isn't it meant to be fiction ?

820
00:53:15,298 --> 00:53:17,008
He even had you living

821
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:18,593
on 10th Street.

822
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:19,719
It isn't me.

823
00:53:19,803 --> 00:53:20,845
Isn't it ?

824
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,138
You know how Richard is.

825
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:23,222
It's a fantasy.

826
00:53:23,264 --> 00:53:24,765
A whole chapter on

827
00:53:24,807 --> 00:53:27,601
<i>Should she buy
some nail polish ?</i>

828
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:28,978
And then, guess what ?

829
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:31,105
After 50 pages, she doesn't.

830
00:53:32,147 --> 00:53:35,275
The whole thing seems to go on
for eternity.

831
00:53:35,442 --> 00:53:36,276
Nothing happens.

832
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:37,277
And then, wham !

833
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,779
For no reason,
she kills herself.

834
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:41,114
His mother

835
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,240
kills herself.

836
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:43,950
Yeah, sure, his mother,
but still for no reason.

837
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:46,285
Well, I...

838
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:47,369
Out of the blue.

839
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:51,123
I know the book is tough,
but I liked it.

840
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:53,292
I know.

841
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:56,836
Only one thing upset me.

842
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,129
What's that ?

843
00:53:58,171 --> 00:53:59,130
What upset you ?

844
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:02,675
Well...

845
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:05,678
that there wasn't more
about you.

846
00:54:10,474 --> 00:54:12,142
That's kind.

847
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,855
I went back to Wellfleet.

848
00:54:20,316 --> 00:54:21,234
You did ?

849
00:54:21,317 --> 00:54:22,235
One day.

850
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:23,402
I didn't tell you ?

851
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,281
No.

852
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,366
But then, I never see you.

853
00:54:30,826 --> 00:54:32,661
You remember the house.

854
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,288
It's still there.

855
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,373
I think you're courageous.

856
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:39,292
Courageous ? Why ?

857
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,127
To dare go visit.

858
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,421
What I mean is...

859
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:45,297
to face the fact

860
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:49,843
that we have lost
those feelings forever.

861
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,222
Shit !

862
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:56,182
Clarissa ?

863
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:58,476
Um...

864
00:54:58,518 --> 00:55:00,561
I don't know what's happening.

865
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:01,562
I'm sorry.

866
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:03,064
I seem to be in some strange

867
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:04,649
sort of mood.

868
00:55:04,732 --> 00:55:05,691
I'm sorry.

869
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:08,652
It's, uh, it's very rude of me.

870
00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:13,115
I seem to be unraveling.

871
00:55:13,198 --> 00:55:14,157
I shouldn't have come.

872
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:15,242
No, it's not you.

873
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:16,117
It's not you.

874
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,162
It's more like having
a presentiment.

875
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:20,788
Do you know what I'm saying ?

876
00:55:22,582 --> 00:55:25,042
Oh, God,
it's probably just nerves

877
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:27,086
about the party, you know ?

878
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:29,671
Bad hostess !

879
00:55:29,755 --> 00:55:32,382
Clarissa, what's happened ?

880
00:55:32,424 --> 00:55:34,217
Jesus !

881
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:36,636
What is it ?!

882
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,137
Oh ! Oh, God !

883
00:55:40,098 --> 00:55:43,184
Do you want me to go ?

884
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:46,979
No, don't go ! Don't...

885
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:48,814
Don't go.

886
00:55:48,897 --> 00:55:50,732
Explain to me
why this is happening.

887
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:55,278
Don't... don't touch me.

888
00:55:55,403 --> 00:55:56,571
Jesus.

889
00:55:56,613 --> 00:55:58,781
It's better if you don't.

890
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,620
It's just too much.

891
00:56:04,703 --> 00:56:07,581
You fly in from San Francisco,

892
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,542
and I've been nursing Richard
for years.

893
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:13,670
And all the time,
I've held myself together...

894
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:15,213
no problem.

895
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,756
I know.

896
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:22,845
One morning, in Wellfleet...

897
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:27,349
you were there,
we were all there...

898
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:29,935
I'd been sleeping with him,

899
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:33,104
and I was out
on the back porch.

900
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:37,066
He came out behind me,

901
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:41,988
and he put his hand
on my shoulder.

902
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:44,824
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.</i>

903
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,162
That's...

904
00:56:52,372 --> 00:56:54,040
That's when...

905
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:56,918
From then on, I've...
been stuck.

906
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:58,044
Stuck ?

907
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:00,296
Yep.

908
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:02,798
Yeah.

909
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:05,843
With the name, I mean.

910
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,098
And now you walk in.

911
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:15,393
To see you

912
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:18,938
walk in...
because I never see you.

913
00:57:19,021 --> 00:57:21,440
Look at you.

914
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:27,988
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

915
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:29,990
It was you he stayed with.

916
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,032
It was you he lived with.

917
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:34,202
I had one summer.

918
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:48,131
The day I left him,

919
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:54,846
I got on a train
and made my way across Europe.

920
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:59,517
I felt free
for the first time in years.

921
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:19,160
So... tell me about
San Francisco.

922
00:58:19,243 --> 00:58:20,494
What's to tell ?

923
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:24,206
I still teach drama
to idiots, mostly.

924
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:25,833
They can't all be idiots.

925
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:28,085
No, no. In fact,

926
00:58:28,168 --> 00:58:31,171
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

927
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:32,422
I've fallen in love.

928
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:34,632
Really ?

929
00:58:34,716 --> 00:58:36,801
Yes.

930
00:58:36,884 --> 00:58:40,012
With a student.

931
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:41,764
Exactly.

932
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:43,766
I know.

933
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:46,226
You think,
Am I still up for this ?

934
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,228
All this intensity,
all those arguments,

935
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:51,106
doors being slammed.

936
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:54,108
Well, you know what it's like.

937
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,652
Are you feeling better ?

938
00:58:58,905 --> 00:58:59,989
A little.

939
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:01,615
Thank you.

940
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:07,704
You think I'm ridiculous ?

941
00:59:09,748 --> 00:59:12,125
Ridiculous ?

942
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:14,836
Fortunate, too.

943
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:47,407
I'm going to leave you
at Mrs. Latch's.

944
00:59:47,491 --> 00:59:49,409
I have to do something.

945
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:03,213
Mommy, I don't want to go.

946
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:05,424
You have to. I'm sorry.

947
01:00:05,507 --> 01:00:07,676
I have something to do
before Daddy gets home.

948
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:57,305
Hello.

949
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:58,889
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

950
01:00:58,973 --> 01:01:00,599
My boy's not very happy.

951
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,977
Mommy, I don't want
to do this.

952
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:06,521
I have to go, honey.

953
01:01:07,856 --> 01:01:10,108
Your mommy has things
she has to do.

954
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:11,651
Come in, I got cookies.

955
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,028
Okay, baby ?

956
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:17,615
You have to be brave now.

957
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,117
Don't worry now.

958
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,577
It's going to be fine.

959
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,619
Well...

960
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:41,345
Honey !

961
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:03,824
Come on. Come on, darling.

962
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:10,747
Mommy !

963
01:02:10,788 --> 01:02:11,748
- Stop it.
- No !

964
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:13,041
Darling, stop it.

965
01:02:13,082 --> 01:02:14,208
Mommy !

966
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,376
- All right.
- Mommy !

967
01:02:15,418 --> 01:02:18,754
Mommy !

968
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:21,840
Come on.

969
01:02:21,924 --> 01:02:23,342
Mommy !

970
01:02:24,426 --> 01:02:27,012
Mommy !

971
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:30,890
No !

972
01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:07,187
Breakfast is served

973
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,188
between 7:00 and 11:00
in the Regency Room,

974
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:10,523
and room service is available

975
01:04:10,606 --> 01:04:12,150
24 hours.

976
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:15,486
Thank you, ma'am.

977
01:04:17,363 --> 01:04:19,198
Is there anything else
you need ?

978
01:04:19,364 --> 01:04:21,950
Yes, um...

979
01:04:22,034 --> 01:04:23,952
No.

980
01:04:24,035 --> 01:04:25,662
Not to be disturbed.

981
01:05:39,855 --> 01:05:43,441
<i>'Did it matter, then ? '
She asked herself,</i>

982
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:45,944
<i>walking toward Bon Street.</i>

983
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:51,324
<i>Did it matter that she must
inevitably cease completely ?</i>

984
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:55,119
<i>All this must go on
without her.</i>

985
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:58,372
<i>Did she resent it ?</i>

986
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,416
<i>Or did it not become consoling</i>

987
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:06,462
<i>to believe that death
ended absolutely ?</i>

988
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:11,008
<i>It is possible to die.</i>

989
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,428
It is possible...

990
01:06:14,511 --> 01:06:15,929
<i>...to die.</i>

991
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:22,143
There was a lovely coat
for Angelica at Harrod's,

992
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:23,728
then nothing for the boys.

993
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:24,938
It seems so unfair.

994
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:26,606
Why should Angelica
be favored ?

995
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:31,193
Virginia ?

996
01:06:33,195 --> 01:06:35,656
Virginia ?

997
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,157
Virginia !

998
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,328
What are you thinking about ?

999
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:56,592
Are you still with us ?

1000
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:11,981
Your aunt's a very
lucky woman, Angelica...

1001
01:07:12,022 --> 01:07:14,525
because she has two lives.

1002
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:17,027
She has the life
she's leading,

1003
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,696
and also the book she's writing.

1004
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:24,033
This makes her very
fortunate indeed.

1005
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:26,160
What were you thinking about ?

1006
01:07:53,143 --> 01:07:57,439
I was going to kill
my heroine...

1007
01:07:57,522 --> 01:08:00,984
but I've changed my mind.

1008
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:05,196
I... I can't.

1009
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:22,378
I fear I may have to kill
someone else instead.

1010
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,595
Oh, Quentin !

1011
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,014
We're ready !

1012
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:37,267
A fascinating visit.

1013
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:40,645
We enjoyed it thoroughly.

1014
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:43,022
Do you have to go already ?

1015
01:08:44,774 --> 01:08:46,025
I do wish you wouldn't go.

1016
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:47,026
Oh, Virginia,

1017
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:49,945
the last thing you want
is our noisiness.

1018
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:53,615
My hopeless, clumsy boys.

1019
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:55,534
Say good-bye, boys.

1020
01:08:55,617 --> 01:08:57,994
Bye !

1021
01:09:00,288 --> 01:09:01,581
You'll return to what ?

1022
01:09:01,623 --> 01:09:03,082
Tonight ?

1023
01:09:03,124 --> 01:09:08,546
Oh, just some...
insufferable dinner.

1024
01:09:08,629 --> 01:09:11,590
Not even you could
envy, Virginia.

1025
01:09:11,674 --> 01:09:13,133
But I do.

1026
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:51,460
Say something, Nessa.

1027
01:09:51,502 --> 01:09:53,170
Didn't you think
I seemed better ?

1028
01:09:53,337 --> 01:09:55,589
Yes...

1029
01:09:55,672 --> 01:09:59,134
Yes... Virginia,
you seemed better.

1030
01:10:12,938 --> 01:10:14,481
You think...

1031
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,985
You think I may one day escape ?

1032
01:10:19,027 --> 01:10:22,280
One day. One...

1033
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,949
Nessa.

1034
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:28,661
Nessa !

1035
01:10:28,702 --> 01:10:30,329
Come on, Nessa.

1036
01:10:30,371 --> 01:10:31,997
Come, Angelica, we must go.

1037
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:35,542
Come on !

1038
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:36,543
Good-bye.

1039
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:38,670
Good-bye, little girl.

1040
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:41,464
Angelica !

1041
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:42,924
The train !

1042
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:47,845
We're going to miss the train.

1043
01:10:47,887 --> 01:10:49,388
Come on. Hurry up.

1044
01:10:49,471 --> 01:10:50,431
Big step.

1045
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:57,354
Come on, come on, come on !

1046
01:10:57,437 --> 01:10:59,022
I want to go home.

1047
01:10:59,064 --> 01:11:00,023
Yeah, all right.

1048
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:02,483
We stayed too long,
we've missed the train.

1049
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:04,735
Stay close.

1050
01:12:28,145 --> 01:12:29,688
I'm sorry, I know.

1051
01:12:29,772 --> 01:12:31,148
I tried to get here earlier.

1052
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:32,774
I tried, okay ? Don't start.

1053
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:34,693
I know,

1054
01:12:34,776 --> 01:12:38,530
it's just incredibly important
because it's your party.

1055
01:12:38,613 --> 01:12:41,199
Julia, how have you been doing ?

1056
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:43,784
I'm fine.

1057
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:44,660
Come here.

1058
01:12:44,702 --> 01:12:47,538
What have you been doing ?

1059
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:49,998
Well, studying, Mom.

1060
01:12:53,919 --> 01:12:55,003
Um...

1061
01:12:55,086 --> 01:12:58,047
So, what should I do ? Chairs ?

1062
01:12:58,131 --> 01:13:00,383
No. Let's clear off the desk
first.

1063
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:03,386
You can take it
into the bedroom.

1064
01:13:03,469 --> 01:13:05,846
I bumped into Louis Waters.

1065
01:13:05,888 --> 01:13:07,181
Oh, you did ?

1066
01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:08,432
Where ?

1067
01:13:08,515 --> 01:13:09,433
In the street.

1068
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:14,020
They're all here, aren't they ?

1069
01:13:14,104 --> 01:13:15,146
All the ghosts.

1070
01:13:15,313 --> 01:13:19,025
All of the ghosts are
assembling for the party.

1071
01:13:19,067 --> 01:13:21,861
He's so weird.

1072
01:13:21,903 --> 01:13:24,405
Oh, what ?

1073
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:25,781
You can't see that ?

1074
01:13:25,865 --> 01:13:28,325
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird ?

1075
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,121
I can see that he's sad.

1076
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:37,625
Well... all your friends
are sad.

1077
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:41,754
You've been crying.
What's happening ?

1078
01:13:45,925 --> 01:13:48,093
All it is,
I looked around this room,

1079
01:13:48,177 --> 01:13:51,013
<i>and I thought,
I'm giving a party.</i>

1080
01:13:51,054 --> 01:13:53,682
<i>All I want to do
is give a party.</i>

1081
01:13:53,723 --> 01:13:55,016
And ?

1082
01:13:55,058 --> 01:13:57,894
I know why he does it;
he does it deliberately.

1083
01:13:57,977 --> 01:14:00,938
Oh, is this Richard ?

1084
01:14:01,022 --> 01:14:02,523
Of course.

1085
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:04,358
He did it this morning.

1086
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,402
He gives me that look.

1087
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:07,903
What look ?

1088
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:11,573
To say...

1089
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:15,452
<i>Your life is... trivial.</i>

1090
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:19,539
<i>You are so trivial.</i>

1091
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,041
Just...

1092
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,626
daily stuff, you know.

1093
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:26,086
Schedules and parties
and... details.

1094
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,965
That's what he means... by it,
that is what he's saying.

1095
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,217
Mom, it only matters
if you think it's true.

1096
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,553
Well ?

1097
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:37,555
Do you ? Tell me.

1098
01:14:40,433 --> 01:14:42,810
When I'm with him, I feel...

1099
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:49,316
Yes, I am living.

1100
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:54,612
And when I'm not with him...

1101
01:14:54,696 --> 01:14:57,282
Yes, everything does seem
sort of s...

1102
01:14:57,365 --> 01:14:59,659
...silly.

1103
01:15:04,788 --> 01:15:06,582
I don't mean with you.

1104
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,875
Oh, I...

1105
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,710
God. Jesus.

1106
01:15:12,003 --> 01:15:14,005
Never with you.

1107
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:15,173
It's all the rest of it.

1108
01:15:20,469 --> 01:15:21,721
Sally ?

1109
01:15:22,972 --> 01:15:24,807
The rest of it.

1110
01:15:29,269 --> 01:15:31,938
False comfort.

1111
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,523
Because ?

1112
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:36,651
<i>If you say to me,
When were you happiest ?</i>

1113
01:15:36,693 --> 01:15:37,860
Mom...

1114
01:15:37,944 --> 01:15:40,446
<i>Tell me the moment
you were happiest.</i>

1115
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:43,699
I know, I know,
it was years ago.

1116
01:15:43,782 --> 01:15:46,827
Yeah.

1117
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:51,456
All you're saying is...
you were once young.

1118
01:15:57,336 --> 01:16:00,256
I remember one morning...

1119
01:16:00,339 --> 01:16:02,383
getting up at dawn,

1120
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:06,762
there was such a sense
of possibility.

1121
01:16:06,845 --> 01:16:08,764
You know ?
That feeling ?

1122
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:09,890
Hmm ?

1123
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:12,308
And I remember
thinking to myself,

1124
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,270
<i>So, this is the
beginning of happiness.</i>

1125
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:17,146
<i>This is where it starts.</i>

1126
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:20,316
<i>And, of course, there
will always be more.</i>

1127
01:16:23,861 --> 01:16:26,363
It never occurred to me

1128
01:16:26,446 --> 01:16:29,491
it wasn't the beginning.

1129
01:16:31,201 --> 01:16:34,495
It was happiness.

1130
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:40,251
It was the moment...

1131
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:42,544
right then.

1132
01:18:07,622 --> 01:18:09,499
Ah, Nelly, good evening.
I was wondering

1133
01:18:09,624 --> 01:18:10,708
if you'd seen Mrs. Woolf.

1134
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:12,752
I thought you knew, sir.

1135
01:18:12,835 --> 01:18:14,837
Mrs. Woolf has gone out.

1136
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:53,039
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

1137
01:19:20,105 --> 01:19:22,399
Mr. Woolf, what an
unexpected pleasure.

1138
01:19:22,483 --> 01:19:23,984
Perhaps you could tell me

1139
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:26,236
exactly what you think
you're doing ?

1140
01:19:26,278 --> 01:19:27,654
What I was doing ?

1141
01:19:27,737 --> 01:19:29,030
I went to look for you,
and you weren't there.

1142
01:19:29,114 --> 01:19:31,658
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.

1143
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:33,451
You disturb me
when you disappear.

1144
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:34,493
I didn't disappear.

1145
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:37,746
I went for a walk.

1146
01:19:37,788 --> 01:19:39,373
A walk ?!
Is that all ?

1147
01:19:39,456 --> 01:19:41,083
Just a walk ?

1148
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:45,003
Virginia, we must go home now.
Nelly's cooking dinner.

1149
01:19:45,087 --> 01:19:47,505
She's already had
a very difficult day.

1150
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:49,340
It's just our obligation
to eat Nelly's dinner.

1151
01:19:49,424 --> 01:19:51,759
There is no such
obligation.

1152
01:19:51,843 --> 01:19:54,136
No such obligation exists.

1153
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,221
Virginia,

1154
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:56,847
you have an obligation
to your own sanity.

1155
01:19:56,931 --> 01:19:59,016
I have endured this custody !

1156
01:19:59,099 --> 01:20:01,518
I have endured
this imprisonment.

1157
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:02,894
Oh, Virginia !

1158
01:20:02,978 --> 01:20:05,689
I am attended by
doctors, everywhere.

1159
01:20:05,772 --> 01:20:07,607
I am attended by doctors

1160
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:10,276
who inform me of
my own interests !

1161
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,527
They know your interests.

1162
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:12,612
They do not !

1163
01:20:12,695 --> 01:20:14,530
They do not speak
for my interests.

1164
01:20:14,614 --> 01:20:15,906
Virginia, I can...

1165
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:18,367
I can see that it must be
hard for a woman of your...

1166
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,285
- Of what ? Of my what, exactly ?
- Uh, your...

1167
01:20:20,327 --> 01:20:21,411
your talents to see

1168
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:23,413
that she may not be
the best judge

1169
01:20:23,497 --> 01:20:24,664
of her own condition !

1170
01:20:24,748 --> 01:20:26,750
Who, then, is a better judge ?

1171
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,084
You have a history !

1172
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:31,546
You have a history
of confinement.

1173
01:20:31,629 --> 01:20:33,089
We brought you to Richmond

1174
01:20:33,172 --> 01:20:36,175
because you have a history
of fits, moods, blackouts,

1175
01:20:36,258 --> 01:20:37,760
hearing voices.

1176
01:20:37,843 --> 01:20:39,803
We brought you here

1177
01:20:39,845 --> 01:20:41,305
to save you
from the irrevocable damage

1178
01:20:41,346 --> 01:20:44,558
you intended upon yourself.

1179
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:47,310
You've tried to kill yourself
twice !

1180
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:52,690
I live daily with that threat.

1181
01:20:52,773 --> 01:20:55,234
I set up the press...
we set up the printing press

1182
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,361
not just for itself,

1183
01:20:57,444 --> 01:21:00,739
not just purely for itself,
but so that you might have

1184
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:04,242
a ready source
of absorption and of remedy.

1185
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,535
Like needlework ?

1186
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:08,830
It was done for you !

1187
01:21:08,913 --> 01:21:11,165
It was done for your betterment !

1188
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:13,292
It was done out of love !

1189
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:18,964
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.

1190
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:22,009
I am ungrateful ?

1191
01:21:22,092 --> 01:21:24,261
You call me ungrateful ?

1192
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:29,599
My life has been stolen from me.

1193
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,354
I'm living in a town
I have no wish to live in.

1194
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:40,067
I'm living... a life
I have no wish to live.

1195
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:46,823
How did this happen ?

1196
01:21:59,918 --> 01:22:03,296
It is time for us
to move back to London.

1197
01:22:08,801 --> 01:22:11,053
I miss London.

1198
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:14,181
I miss London life.

1199
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:18,936
This is not you speaking,
Virginia.

1200
01:22:19,019 --> 01:22:20,479
This is an aspect
of your illness.

1201
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:22,522
- It's not you.
- It is me. It is my voice.

1202
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:23,648
It's not your voice.

1203
01:22:23,732 --> 01:22:24,941
It's mine and mine alone.

1204
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:26,443
This is the voice
that you hear.

1205
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:29,237
It is not ! It is mine !

1206
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,280
I'm dying in this town !

1207
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,411
If you were thinking clearly,
Virginia,

1208
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,787
you'd recall it was London

1209
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,539
that brought you low.

1210
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:43,500
If I were thinking clearly...

1211
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,378
If I were thinking clearly...

1212
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,173
We brought you to Richmond
to give you peace.

1213
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:53,092
If I were thinking clearly,
Leonard,

1214
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:57,137
I would tell you that I wrestle
alone in the dark,

1215
01:22:57,221 --> 01:23:00,432
in the deep dark,
and that only I can know,

1216
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:03,518
only I can understand
my own condition.

1217
01:23:04,894 --> 01:23:06,479
You live with the threat...
you tell me...

1218
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:08,439
you live with the threat
of my extinction.

1219
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:12,068
Leonard, I live with it,

1220
01:23:12,151 --> 01:23:13,652
too.

1221
01:23:17,322 --> 01:23:19,950
This is my right.

1222
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:22,285
It is the right
of every human being.

1223
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:25,914
I choose not the suffocating
anesthetic of the suburbs,

1224
01:23:25,997 --> 01:23:28,249
but the violent jolt
of the capital.

1225
01:23:28,332 --> 01:23:30,084
That is my choice.

1226
01:23:30,167 --> 01:23:32,711
The meanest patient,

1227
01:23:32,795 --> 01:23:35,422
yes, even the very lowest
is allowed some say

1228
01:23:35,506 --> 01:23:38,133
in the matter of her own
prescription.

1229
01:23:38,217 --> 01:23:40,552
Thereby she defines
her humanity.

1230
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:52,146
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,

1231
01:23:52,188 --> 01:23:57,776
I could be happy in this
quietness.

1232
01:23:57,859 --> 01:24:03,198
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death,

1233
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:04,991
I choose death.

1234
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:17,836
Very well, London, then.

1235
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,464
We'll go back to London.

1236
01:24:56,163 --> 01:24:59,124
You hungry ?

1237
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,005
I'm a little hungry myself.

1238
01:25:25,773 --> 01:25:28,859
Come along.

1239
01:25:28,943 --> 01:25:31,028
London train on platform one !

1240
01:25:31,111 --> 01:25:35,282
This is the London train
terminating at Vauxhall.

1241
01:25:39,786 --> 01:25:44,499
You cannot find peace
by avoiding life, Leonard.

1242
01:25:52,589 --> 01:25:54,591
This is the London train !

1243
01:25:56,009 --> 01:25:59,804
London train on platform one !

1244
01:26:15,402 --> 01:26:20,573
Mommy !

1245
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:32,042
Hey. Hey, there, bug.

1246
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:34,127
Hey, what's wrong ?

1247
01:26:34,211 --> 01:26:35,962
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

1248
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:37,130
Sorry I'm late.

1249
01:26:37,214 --> 01:26:38,256
He's fine.

1250
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:39,299
He's been fine.

1251
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:40,842
He's, he's just happy
to see you.

1252
01:26:40,925 --> 01:26:43,219
Aw, it couldn't have been
that bad, could it ? Hmm ?

1253
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:44,971
So, you got it cut, then ?

1254
01:26:45,012 --> 01:26:46,931
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.

1255
01:26:46,973 --> 01:26:47,890
Looks great.

1256
01:26:47,973 --> 01:26:49,391
Well, they didn't have
to do very much.

1257
01:26:49,475 --> 01:26:51,143
Well, we had a fine time

1258
01:26:51,185 --> 01:26:52,519
together.

1259
01:26:53,645 --> 01:26:55,605
Thank you very much.

1260
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:03,738
So, that wasn't too bad, was it ?

1261
01:27:03,821 --> 01:27:05,364
I wasn't gone too long.

1262
01:27:05,448 --> 01:27:07,533
No, you weren't long.

1263
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:09,410
That's right.

1264
01:27:12,204 --> 01:27:14,998
At one point...

1265
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,042
I don't know.

1266
01:27:20,003 --> 01:27:24,715
There was a moment where
I thought I might be longer.

1267
01:27:24,799 --> 01:27:26,592
But I changed my mind.

1268
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:35,350
What is it, honey ?

1269
01:27:35,392 --> 01:27:38,937
Mommy, I love you.

1270
01:27:41,147 --> 01:27:43,232
I love you, too, baby.

1271
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,533
What's wrong ?

1272
01:27:57,329 --> 01:27:58,371
What ?

1273
01:28:06,087 --> 01:28:07,546
Don't worry, honey,
everything's fine.

1274
01:28:07,588 --> 01:28:10,382
We're going to have
a wonderful party,

1275
01:28:10,424 --> 01:28:14,261
and we've made your daddy
such a nice cake.

1276
01:28:19,933 --> 01:28:21,476
I love you, sweetheart.

1277
01:28:22,769 --> 01:28:25,062
You're my guy.

1278
01:29:01,846 --> 01:29:06,809
Mommy !

1279
01:30:03,277 --> 01:30:06,280
Richard, it's me. I'm early.

1280
01:30:10,867 --> 01:30:12,994
What the hell is going on ?

1281
01:30:13,995 --> 01:30:14,955
Richard !

1282
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,251
What are you doing here ?
You're early !

1283
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:22,587
Wha-What is going on here ?

1284
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,296
What are you doing ?

1285
01:30:24,338 --> 01:30:26,173
I- I had this wonderful idea.

1286
01:30:26,215 --> 01:30:29,510
I needed some light.
I needed to let in some light !

1287
01:30:29,551 --> 01:30:32,262
Richard, what are you doing ?

1288
01:30:32,345 --> 01:30:34,681
I had this fantastic notion.

1289
01:30:34,723 --> 01:30:36,975
I took the Xanax
and the Ritalin together.

1290
01:30:37,058 --> 01:30:38,518
It-it never occurred to me.

1291
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:39,227
Richard...

1292
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,394
Don't come near me !

1293
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:50,946
It seemed to me I needed
to let in some light.

1294
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:56,784
What do you think ?
I cleared away all the windows.

1295
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,454
All right, Richard,
do me one simple favor.

1296
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:00,663
Come. Come sit.

1297
01:31:00,746 --> 01:31:03,666
I don't think I can make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1298
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:04,834
You don't have to go
to the party.

1299
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,168
You don't have to go
to the ceremony.

1300
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,878
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1301
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,463
You can do as you like.

1302
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:12,549
But I still have to face
the hours, don't I ?

1303
01:31:12,632 --> 01:31:14,718
I mean, the hours
after the party,

1304
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:17,053
and the hours after that...

1305
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:20,181
You do have good days still.

1306
01:31:20,223 --> 01:31:22,016
You know you do.

1307
01:31:22,099 --> 01:31:24,393
Not really.

1308
01:31:24,435 --> 01:31:27,354
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...

1309
01:31:27,396 --> 01:31:28,730
not really true.

1310
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:38,489
Are they here ?

1311
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:40,324
Who ?

1312
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:41,158
The voices.

1313
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:44,078
Oh, the voices are always here.

1314
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:47,873
And it's the voices that you're
hearing now, isn't it ?

1315
01:31:47,956 --> 01:31:49,666
No, no, no, no.

1316
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:53,128
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

1317
01:31:57,799 --> 01:32:01,344
I've stayed alive for you,

1318
01:32:01,427 --> 01:32:03,262
but now you have to let me go.

1319
01:32:05,097 --> 01:32:06,056
Richard, I...

1320
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,141
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1321
01:32:07,224 --> 01:32:09,476
Wait.

1322
01:32:13,313 --> 01:32:14,272
Tell me a story.

1323
01:32:14,314 --> 01:32:15,940
What about ?

1324
01:32:16,024 --> 01:32:19,944
Tell me a story from your day.

1325
01:32:20,027 --> 01:32:20,987
I, um...

1326
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,988
I- I got up...

1327
01:32:23,072 --> 01:32:24,698
Yes ?

1328
01:32:24,782 --> 01:32:31,246
...and I went out, and, uh,
I went to buy flowers,

1329
01:32:31,288 --> 01:32:33,206
Like Mrs. Dalloway,
in the book, you know ?

1330
01:32:33,289 --> 01:32:34,666
Yes.

1331
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:35,792
And it was a beautiful morning.

1332
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,335
Was it ?

1333
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:39,420
Yes, it was so beautiful.

1334
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:41,172
It was so fresh.

1335
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:42,965
Oh, fresh, was it ?

1336
01:32:43,048 --> 01:32:44,049
Yes.

1337
01:32:47,886 --> 01:32:48,428
Like a...

1338
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:51,264
like a morning on the beach ?

1339
01:32:51,306 --> 01:32:52,891
Yes.

1340
01:32:52,974 --> 01:32:54,058
Like that ?

1341
01:32:54,142 --> 01:32:55,977
Yes.

1342
01:32:56,019 --> 01:32:59,939
Like that morning when you
walked out of that old house,

1343
01:33:00,022 --> 01:33:03,192
and you were, you were 18,
and maybe I was 19.

1344
01:33:03,275 --> 01:33:05,069
Yes.

1345
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,279
I was 19 years old,

1346
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:11,908
and I'd never seen
anything so beautiful.

1347
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:14,035
You...

1348
01:33:14,118 --> 01:33:15,995
coming out of a glass door

1349
01:33:16,037 --> 01:33:18,581
in the early morning,
still sleepy.

1350
01:33:18,664 --> 01:33:21,459
Isn't it strange ?

1351
01:33:22,751 --> 01:33:27,422
Most ordinary morning
in anybody's life.

1352
01:33:29,966 --> 01:33:32,969
I'm afraid I can't make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1353
01:33:33,052 --> 01:33:36,472
The party...

1354
01:33:36,597 --> 01:33:38,558
doesn't matter.

1355
01:33:38,641 --> 01:33:42,102
You've been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.

1356
01:33:44,354 --> 01:33:46,440
I love you.

1357
01:33:51,653 --> 01:33:53,113
<i>I don't think two people</i>

1358
01:33:53,196 --> 01:33:55,573
<i>could've been happier
than we've been.</i>

1359
01:34:03,539 --> 01:34:04,623
Oh, God, no !

1360
01:34:13,798 --> 01:34:15,842
Happy birthday.

1361
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:17,218
Happy birthday, Dan.

1362
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,552
This is perfect.

1363
01:34:18,636 --> 01:34:20,387
This is just perfect.

1364
01:34:20,429 --> 01:34:22,640
Oh, do you think so ?

1365
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:23,807
Do you really think so ?

1366
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:24,808
Why, sure.

1367
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:26,685
You must've been
working all day.

1368
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,436
Well, that's what
we were doing.

1369
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,146
Weren't we, bug ?

1370
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:32,398
Been working all day.

1371
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,608
This is just fantastic.

1372
01:34:33,691 --> 01:34:35,193
It's what I've always wanted.

1373
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:37,028
Oh, Dan.

1374
01:34:37,111 --> 01:34:38,446
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.

1375
01:34:38,529 --> 01:34:40,239
I'll tell you
how it all happened.

1376
01:34:40,281 --> 01:34:42,241
Don't.

1377
01:34:42,282 --> 01:34:43,409
I want to.

1378
01:34:43,492 --> 01:34:46,411
I want to tell him the story.

1379
01:34:46,495 --> 01:34:47,454
What happened...

1380
01:34:47,537 --> 01:34:49,122
when I was in the war.

1381
01:34:49,206 --> 01:34:51,708
At war, I found myself

1382
01:34:51,749 --> 01:34:53,960
thinking about this girl
that I had seen...

1383
01:34:54,043 --> 01:34:55,420
I had never met her...

1384
01:34:55,503 --> 01:34:56,796
at high school,

1385
01:34:56,879 --> 01:34:58,381
this... strange,

1386
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:02,509
fragile-looking girl
named Laura McGrath.

1387
01:35:06,013 --> 01:35:07,305
Yeah.

1388
01:35:07,389 --> 01:35:08,431
And she was shy...

1389
01:35:09,516 --> 01:35:12,101
and she was interesting.

1390
01:35:12,185 --> 01:35:14,562
And... well,
your mother won't mind if

1391
01:35:14,604 --> 01:35:15,563
I tell you this, Richie.

1392
01:35:15,605 --> 01:35:17,148
She was the sort of
girl that you see

1393
01:35:17,231 --> 01:35:18,274
sitting mostly on her own.

1394
01:35:18,357 --> 01:35:20,067
And I'll tell you...

1395
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,653
sometimes, when I was
in the South Pacific,

1396
01:35:22,736 --> 01:35:24,404
the fact is

1397
01:35:24,446 --> 01:35:25,781
that I used to think

1398
01:35:25,864 --> 01:35:27,407
about this girl.

1399
01:35:27,532 --> 01:35:28,450
Dan.

1400
01:35:28,533 --> 01:35:29,951
I used to think

1401
01:35:29,993 --> 01:35:31,953
about bringing her to a house,

1402
01:35:31,995 --> 01:35:34,288
to a life.

1403
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,458
Pretty much like this.

1404
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:41,754
And it was the thought
of the happiness...

1405
01:35:43,422 --> 01:35:46,842
the thought of this woman,

1406
01:35:46,925 --> 01:35:48,009
the thought of this life...

1407
01:35:48,093 --> 01:35:49,844
that's what kept me going.

1408
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:53,806
I had an idea of our happiness.

1409
01:36:21,832 --> 01:36:23,750
Why does someone have to die ?

1410
01:36:28,088 --> 01:36:29,380
Leonard...

1411
01:36:29,464 --> 01:36:31,174
In your book,
you said someone had to die.

1412
01:36:31,257 --> 01:36:32,175
Hmm.

1413
01:36:32,258 --> 01:36:34,343
Why ?

1414
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:38,931
Is that a stupid question ?

1415
01:36:39,014 --> 01:36:40,349
No.

1416
01:36:40,432 --> 01:36:41,767
I imagine my question is stupid.

1417
01:36:43,602 --> 01:36:45,562
Not at all.

1418
01:36:46,938 --> 01:36:48,189
Well ?

1419
01:36:50,942 --> 01:36:52,902
Someone has to die

1420
01:36:52,985 --> 01:36:55,655
in order that the rest of us
should value life more.

1421
01:36:57,781 --> 01:36:59,700
It's contrast.

1422
01:36:59,783 --> 01:37:01,952
And who will die ?

1423
01:37:03,787 --> 01:37:05,372
Tell me.

1424
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:11,169
The poet will die.

1425
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:13,921
The visionary.

1426
01:37:28,143 --> 01:37:29,394
What are you doing ?

1427
01:37:29,519 --> 01:37:31,729
I'm brushing my teeth.

1428
01:37:36,108 --> 01:37:38,068
Are you coming to bed ?

1429
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,696
Yeah, in a minute.

1430
01:37:42,739 --> 01:37:45,075
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

1431
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:51,080
I ran into Ray.

1432
01:37:51,122 --> 01:37:53,124
He said Kitty had to
go to the hospital.

1433
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,752
I know.

1434
01:37:56,836 --> 01:37:58,087
Nothing serious.

1435
01:37:58,128 --> 01:38:00,339
He said just a checkup.

1436
01:38:01,924 --> 01:38:03,925
I'm terrified.

1437
01:38:04,009 --> 01:38:06,052
Why ?

1438
01:38:08,346 --> 01:38:10,765
Only I knew
that she could disappear.

1439
01:38:12,767 --> 01:38:13,935
Maybe you could

1440
01:38:14,018 --> 01:38:15,770
go see her
in the morning, honey.

1441
01:38:23,693 --> 01:38:25,153
I was going to.

1442
01:38:25,237 --> 01:38:27,947
I was going to stop by.

1443
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:30,783
I've had a wonderful day,

1444
01:38:30,867 --> 01:38:33,369
and I have you to thank.

1445
01:38:38,916 --> 01:38:43,295
Come to bed, honey.

1446
01:38:43,336 --> 01:38:45,422
I'm coming.

1447
01:38:54,055 --> 01:38:57,016
Are you coming ?

1448
01:38:57,099 --> 01:38:59,017
Yes.

1449
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:19,578
What ?

1450
01:39:22,664 --> 01:39:24,916
I was hoping
you were going to bed.

1451
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,085
I am.

1452
01:39:27,168 --> 01:39:29,128
I am going to bed.

1453
01:39:31,547 --> 01:39:33,507
What, then ?

1454
01:39:35,718 --> 01:39:38,887
All else is clear.

1455
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:41,681
The outline of the story
is planned,

1456
01:39:41,765 --> 01:39:43,558
now one thing only.

1457
01:39:43,642 --> 01:39:46,519
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.

1458
01:40:27,974 --> 01:40:30,768
You're Laura Brown.

1459
01:40:30,851 --> 01:40:35,689
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.

1460
01:40:37,733 --> 01:40:39,860
Of course.

1461
01:40:41,945 --> 01:40:43,446
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.

1462
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,323
Please come in.

1463
01:40:54,206 --> 01:40:57,084
My friend Sally
is in the kitchen,

1464
01:40:57,167 --> 01:40:59,503
and my daughter.

1465
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:01,421
I'll take this.

1466
01:41:01,546 --> 01:41:04,424
We were having a party.

1467
01:41:04,466 --> 01:41:07,802
We were going to have a party.

1468
01:41:07,885 --> 01:41:09,095
I was lucky.

1469
01:41:09,178 --> 01:41:10,930
I got the last plane
from Toronto.

1470
01:41:10,972 --> 01:41:15,559
So, that's the monster.

1471
01:41:15,642 --> 01:41:17,811
Hope I did the right thing.

1472
01:41:17,895 --> 01:41:19,855
I found your number
in his phone book.

1473
01:41:19,938 --> 01:41:24,317
Yes, he had it.

1474
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,903
We didn't speak often.

1475
01:41:38,789 --> 01:41:42,167
It's a terrible thing,
Miss Vaughan... to outlive

1476
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,877
your whole family.

1477
01:41:47,422 --> 01:41:49,924
Richard's father died.

1478
01:41:50,007 --> 01:41:53,427
Yes, he-he died of cancer
quite young.

1479
01:41:53,469 --> 01:41:55,387
And Richard's sister is dead.

1480
01:42:01,142 --> 01:42:04,229
Obviously, you...
feel unworthy.

1481
01:42:04,312 --> 01:42:09,275
Gives you feelings
of unworthiness.

1482
01:42:09,358 --> 01:42:12,528
You survive and they don't.

1483
01:42:16,949 --> 01:42:19,159
Have you read the poems ?

1484
01:42:19,242 --> 01:42:21,745
Oh, yes. Oh...

1485
01:42:23,413 --> 01:42:25,456
I also read the novel.

1486
01:42:33,172 --> 01:42:38,260
You see, uh, people say
the novel is difficult.

1487
01:42:38,343 --> 01:42:42,013
Uh... I know.

1488
01:42:42,097 --> 01:42:43,973
They say that.

1489
01:42:48,936 --> 01:42:51,480
I know.

1490
01:42:53,732 --> 01:42:56,360
He had me die in the novel.

1491
01:42:56,443 --> 01:42:59,112
I- I-I know why he did that.

1492
01:43:04,075 --> 01:43:05,159
It hurt, of course.

1493
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:07,536
I can't pretend it didn't hurt,
but I...

1494
01:43:07,578 --> 01:43:11,081
I know why he did it.

1495
01:43:13,792 --> 01:43:17,963
You left Richard
when he was a child.

1496
01:43:19,756 --> 01:43:24,052
I left both my children.

1497
01:43:24,093 --> 01:43:26,804
I abandoned them.

1498
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:36,438
They say it's the worst thing
a mother can do.

1499
01:43:49,575 --> 01:43:51,201
You have a daughter.

1500
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:57,374
Yes...

1501
01:43:57,415 --> 01:44:00,377
But I never met Julia's father.

1502
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:02,629
You so wanted a child.

1503
01:44:04,464 --> 01:44:07,091
That's right.

1504
01:44:07,174 --> 01:44:10,135
You're a lucky woman.

1505
01:44:19,436 --> 01:44:22,063
There are times
when you don't belong,

1506
01:44:22,105 --> 01:44:25,191
and you think you're going
to kill yourself.

1507
01:44:31,697 --> 01:44:33,907
Once, I went to a hotel.

1508
01:44:37,661 --> 01:44:41,289
Later that night, I made a plan.

1509
01:44:41,372 --> 01:44:43,833
The plan was
I would leave my family

1510
01:44:43,916 --> 01:44:48,129
when my second child was born...

1511
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:50,673
and that's what I did.

1512
01:44:50,756 --> 01:44:54,509
I got up one morning,

1513
01:44:54,593 --> 01:44:57,095
made breakfast,

1514
01:44:57,178 --> 01:45:00,640
went to the bus stop,

1515
01:45:00,682 --> 01:45:03,893
got on a bus.

1516
01:45:03,976 --> 01:45:06,228
I'd left a note.

1517
01:45:10,524 --> 01:45:15,278
I got a job in a library
in Canada.

1518
01:45:21,868 --> 01:45:23,786
It would...

1519
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:29,708
be wonderful to say
you regretted it.

1520
01:45:29,792 --> 01:45:31,793
It would be easy.

1521
01:45:36,965 --> 01:45:39,717
But what does it mean ?

1522
01:45:39,801 --> 01:45:43,804
What does it mean to regret...

1523
01:45:43,888 --> 01:45:46,766
when you have no choice ?

1524
01:45:57,192 --> 01:45:59,611
It's what you can bear.

1525
01:46:05,449 --> 01:46:07,368
There it is.

1526
01:46:07,493 --> 01:46:09,828
No one's going to forgive me.

1527
01:46:16,126 --> 01:46:20,255
It was death.

1528
01:46:20,338 --> 01:46:23,049
I chose life.

1529
01:47:22,812 --> 01:47:25,439
Time to take your coat off.

1530
01:48:09,396 --> 01:48:11,440
I thought you might like
a cup of tea.

1531
01:48:11,481 --> 01:48:13,191
Oh my goodness.

1532
01:48:13,275 --> 01:48:15,110
Thank you, dear.

1533
01:48:15,151 --> 01:48:17,278
I feel like I'm stealing
your room.

1534
01:48:19,322 --> 01:48:20,323
Um, we put the food away,

1535
01:48:20,448 --> 01:48:22,241
so, if you're at all hungry
in the night,

1536
01:48:22,325 --> 01:48:23,451
just help yourself.

1537
01:48:23,492 --> 01:48:24,702
Oh, I will.

1538
01:48:24,785 --> 01:48:26,912
Where will you sleep ?

1539
01:48:26,995 --> 01:48:28,288
Oh, the sofa.

1540
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:30,248
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1541
01:48:38,297 --> 01:48:40,550
Good night, sweetheart.

1542
01:48:41,801 --> 01:48:43,761
Good night.

1543
01:49:03,529 --> 01:49:05,614
<i>Dear Leonard,</i>

1544
01:49:05,698 --> 01:49:10,869
<i>to look life in the face...</i>

1545
01:49:10,952 --> 01:49:17,208
<i>always to look life in the face,</i>

1546
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:22,713
<i>and to know it for what it is.</i>

1547
01:49:22,797 --> 01:49:28,343
<i>At last, to know it,</i>

1548
01:49:28,385 --> 01:49:32,097
<i>to love it for what it is,</i>

1549
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:35,808
<i>and then...</i>

1550
01:49:35,892 --> 01:49:38,603
<i>to put it away.</i>

1551
01:49:42,356 --> 01:49:45,692
<i>Leonard...</i>

1552
01:49:45,734 --> 01:49:50,363
<i>always the years between us,</i>

1553
01:49:50,405 --> 01:49:54,159
<i>always the years...</i>

1554
01:49:54,242 --> 01:49:59,580
<i>always... the love...</i>

1555
01:49:59,622 --> 01:50:02,917
<i>always...</i>

1556
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,419
<i>the hours.</i>
