1
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,720
<i>I was orphaned at a young age
and was never given a name.</i>

2
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
<i>People simply called me Nameless.</i>

3
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,970
<i>With no family name to live up to,
I devoted myself to the sword.</i>

4
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,770
<i>I spent 10 years perfecting
unique skills as a swordsman.</i>

5
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,270
<i>The King of Qin
has summoned me to court,</i>

6
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,770
<i>for what I have accomplished
has astonished the kingdom.</i>

7
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,020
By order of his majesty,

8
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,600
we have traveled overnight to bring
the warrior to see you, Prime Minister.

9
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,540
Sky, Snow and Broken Sword.

10
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,750
For 10 years
these three assassins from Zhao

11
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,670
have repeatedly plotted
to kill his majesty,

12
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,640
so he has not known
a single peaceful night's sleep.

13
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,810
Today we discover that a hero
from our great kingdom of Qin

14
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,180
has single-handedly
wiped out the enemy.

15
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,860
From now on his majesty
can once more sleep without fear!

16
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,230
His majesty's courtiers
congratulate him.

17
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,240
Heaven has sent a great warrior
to vanquish the assassins!

18
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,460
By his majesty's command,
summon the warrior!

19
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,920
When you enter the palace,

20
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,750
always remain 100 paces
from the throne

21
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,920
or you will be killed without question.

22
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,010
Please do not forget!

23
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,500
For 10 years,

24
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,580
no one's approached
within 100 paces of the throne.

25
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,920
- Do you know why?
- Assassins were everywhere.

26
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,550
Correct.

27
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,050
As long as there are assassins,
I cannot remove my armor.

28
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,510
Now that you have rooted out this evil
on our behalf,

29
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,850
what do you desire as a reward?

30
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,970
To rid great Qin of its enemies
is my duty. I desire no reward.

31
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,810
In accordance with Qin law,
you must be properly rewarded.

32
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,780
Sky's silver spear

33
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,160
has wounded untold numbers of
our brave Qin warriors.

34
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,240
Pronounce my edict!

35
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,540
By order of his majesty,
he who vanquishes the assassin Sky

36
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,830
will be awarded 1,000 pieces of gold
and authority over 1,000 households.

37
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,590
Advance within 20 paces of the throne
and drink with his majesty!

38
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,860
According to my informants,
you are a citizen of Qin.

39
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,650
Your humble servant Nameless,
Prefect of Lan Meng district.

40
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,400
A mere local Prefect! With authority
over no more than 10 square miles!

41
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,570
This is the lowest rank of office
in our kingdom.

42
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,490
What enabled you to overcome
the three deadly assassins from Zhao?

43
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,540
I dealt with them one at a time.

44
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,500
Tell me in detail.

45
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,460
Perhaps your majesty has heard that
Broken Sword and Snow were lovers?

46
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,920
Indeed I have.

47
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,670
And was your majesty aware

48
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,340
that they had not spoken
to each other for three years?

49
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,840
Three years without words?
Why was that?

50
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,850
Snow had spent one night with Sky
as lovers.

51
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,970
Broken Sword took this to heart.

52
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,640
Why have I not heard about this?

53
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,900
It took your servant much effort
to uncover this secret.

54
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,230
To create a rift between
Snow and Broken Sword,

55
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,950
I had first to dispose of Sky.

56
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,160
I am beginning to fathom your strategy.

57
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,910
Your majesty is most perceptive.

58
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,370
What did you use to defeat Sky?

59
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,540
The sword.

60
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,130
<i>Within Lan Meng it is my responsibility
to arrest criminals.</i>

61
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,170
<i>On the fifth day of the sixth month
Sky appeared in a chess house.</i>

62
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,720
<i>I had heard</i>

63
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,930
<i>that he was a lover of chess
and music, and was a frequent visitor.</i>

64
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,820
The seven elite guards
from Qin Court...

65
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,040
We have been trailing you for days.
You are under arrest!

66
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,710
Reveal your weapon
and identify yourself!

67
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,010
Halt!

68
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,940
The local Prefect.
What can I do for you?

69
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,860
This region is under my control!

70
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,360
And?

71
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,370
You are a wanted criminal!
I am here to arrest you!

72
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,010
Sir, would you be kind enough
to play us another tune?

73
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,120
<i>Martial arts and music
share the same principles.</i>

74
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,120
<i>Both wrestle with complex chords
and rare melodies.</i>

75
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>We stood facing each other
for a long time,</i>

76
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,670
<i>neither of us made a move,</i>

77
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,260
<i>while our combat unfolded
in the depths of our minds.</i>

78
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,680
How swift your sword must be!

79
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,850
I prided myself in knowing
every corner of our land.

80
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,110
Yet I was unaware that

81
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,530
within the small district of Lan Meng
there is such a talent like you.

82
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,160
Broken Sword.

83
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,540
Flying Snow.

84
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,120
By edict of his majesty:

85
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,630
The assassins Broken Sword and Flying
Snow have always worked as partners.

86
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,380
He who eliminates either one of them

87
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,300
is awarded 10,000 pieces of gold
and authority over 5,000 households.

88
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,840
Advance within 10 paces
and drink with his majesty!

89
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,650
Three years ago Snow and Broken
Sword stormed our palace together.

90
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,070
Three thousand soldiers
were unable to resist them.

91
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,120
I have since had this great hall emptied,
so there is nowhere to hide!

92
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Are you saying that your sword
was swifter than theirs combined?

93
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
No.

94
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,750
So how did you manage
to overcome them?

95
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,020
<i>I was disguised as a citizen of Zhao
and went searching for them there.</i>

96
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:09,770
<i>It was rumored they were hiding
in a small calligraphy school.</i>

97
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,570
<i>I arrived as your majesty's troops
approached.</i>

98
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,320
<i>People fled in terror.</i>

99
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,160
<i>Only the students
and their master remained.</i>

100
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,370
Why have you come at such a time?

101
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,000
Who are you?

102
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,710
I am from a small province in Zhao.

103
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,420
My father's dying wish was to acquire
a scroll from your prestigious school.

104
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,220
I fear this may be the last day
of our school.

105
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,970
My honorable guest,
whose calligraphy do you seek?

106
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,100
Master Broken Sword's.

107
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,020
<i>Broken Sword's power
was immediately apparent to me.</i>

108
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,940
<i>Rumor had it that his martial arts skills
were rooted in his calligraphy.</i>

109
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,690
<i>In order to discover the swordsman,</i>

110
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,320
<i>I had first to study the calligrapher.</i>

111
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,860
- Which character do you seek?
- "Sword."

112
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,240
My honored guest is fond of swords?

113
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,120
I am merely fulfilling
my father's last wish.

114
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,090
What dimension of scroll?

115
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Eight feet.

116
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,430
A scroll of that size requires red ink.

117
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,640
Master wishes to borrow some red ink
from the mistress.

118
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,780
Master wishes to borrow some red ink.

119
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,160
Has mistress heard my request?

120
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,540
Master wishes to borrow some red ink.

121
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,710
Tell him to come himself.

122
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,230
Your student respectfully requests
some red ink.

123
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,920
<i>Broken Sword had not even
started on the scroll</i>

124
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,090
<i>when your majesty's troops arrived
at the city gates.</i>

125
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,100
Prepare!

126
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,910
Draw!

127
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,920
<i>Your majesty's army
has never lost a war</i>

128
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,760
<i>because they never underestimate
their enemy. Their tactics are brilliant,</i>

129
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,590
<i>and the archers are peerless
in their range and accuracy.</i>

130
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,520
<i>Wherever they venture
their reputation precedes them.</i>

131
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Storm! Storm! Storm!

132
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,080
You must all remember

133
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,790
the arrows of Qin may be powerful.

134
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,460
They may penetrate our cities
and destroy our kingdom.

135
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,590
But they can never annihilate
our written words!

136
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,840
Today

137
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,720
you will all learn
the true spirit of our art.

138
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,620
Storm! Storm! Storm!

139
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,110
The Zhao people,
did they really not move?

140
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,400
People from Zhao
are particularly strong in spirit.

141
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,240
You asked for the character "Sword."
Why was it difficult to do?

142
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,200
There are normally 19 ways
of writing this character.

143
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,830
What I requested from Broken Sword
was the 20th variation.

144
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,240
Calligraphy and swordplay

145
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,870
both rely on merging
the power of the wrist

146
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,250
with the spirit in the heart.

147
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,290
This 20th variation would reveal
the essence of his swordsmanship.

148
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,760
To think that one character
can be written 19 different ways!

149
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,380
How can people communicate when
they do not understand each other?

150
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,510
Once I have conquered
the six Kingdoms

151
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,640
and suppressed all other
rebellious states,

152
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,730
I shall rid the country
of these hopeless confusions,

153
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,020
keep one unified language
for the whole land.

154
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,270
Wouldn't that be something?

155
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,610
Is your majesty not stopping
after defeating the six Kingdoms?

156
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,780
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

157
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,570
I intend to lead our army
to every corner of this land

158
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,870
until we have established
a vast and powerful empire!

159
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,990
You must be mistress Flying Snow.

160
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,320
- Why are you leaving?
- I am going to fend off the arrows.

161
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,870
You are not needed. Please retire.

162
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,290
The archers of Qin are legendary.

163
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,540
Mistress Snow may not be able
to repel them on her own.

164
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,610
Storm! Storm! Storm!

165
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,300
You were quite brilliant.

166
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,380
Mistress Snow is far superior.

167
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,680
You have not come for the calligraphy.

168
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,430
Who are you?

169
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,060
I have brought something to show you.

170
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Please meet me in the library
at midnight.

171
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,740
- Beautiful calligraphy.
- Beautiful swordplay.

172
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,200
But you have not seen me
use my sword.

173
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,160
Without your sword
this scroll would not exist.

174
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,710
Please meet me in the library
at midnight.

175
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,870
I have something to show you.

176
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,340
<i>While several hundred thousand
Qin troops</i>

177
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,210
<i>were preparing for the next onslaught,</i>

178
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,840
<i>I spent the night
contemplating the scroll,</i>

179
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,430
<i>hoping to discover the secret
behind Broken Sword's skills.</i>

180
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,690
You say this calligraphy
contains the mystery of swordplay,

181
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,280
but I cannot see anything unusual here.

182
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,700
The brush and the sword
are fundamentally connected.

183
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,790
Their mystery is only revealed to those
who can perceive the connection.

184
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,080
- And you can?
- Not entirely.

185
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,250
Then how were you able to challenge
the two of them?

186
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,850
- Sky fell by your sword?
- Yes.

187
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,650
Who are you? Why have you come?

188
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,570
I am a citizen of Qin.
I have a message from Sky.

189
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,900
Speak.

190
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,240
Sky said he had always lived his life
without burden or responsibility.

191
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,080
Only one person had ever
touched his heart.

192
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,790
- Who?
- Flying Snow.

193
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,640
Sky said he was certain
Snow would avenge his death.

194
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,020
If you agree to a duel, meet me
at the Qin army encampment tomorrow.

195
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,320
Leave now.

196
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,490
Go on!

197
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,140
I know you saw us!

198
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,150
I deliberately wanted you to see us!

199
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,570
You are no longer in my heart!

200
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,880
We are both very foolish.

201
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,730
I am not going to fight with you.

202
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,810
Please leave.

203
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,280
I am going to kill you
and avenge my master!

204
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,670
Since you want to die,
I shall assist you.

205
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,900
What are you laughing at?

206
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,780
What you did last night.
It was unbelievably stupid.

207
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,120
<i>When we fought,
I could see that my plan had worked.</i>

208
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,240
<i>She was emotional and agitated,
unable to focus.</i>

209
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,160
<i>I defeated her easily.</i>

210
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,060
Who would have thought that
Broken Sword and Snow

211
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,350
were so emotionally fragile.

212
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,580
You are saying that you won
by setting them against each other?

213
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Yes.

214
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,330
And the reason they became enemies
was because they were jealous?

215
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,420
Yes.

216
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,550
Your story appears to make sense,

217
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:34,220
but in my opinion you have
underestimated one person.

218
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,510
Who?

219
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,350
Me.

220
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,430
Would you like to know what kind of
impression they made on me?

221
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,940
Three years ago, I had once
fought them face to face.

222
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,110
I found them both
honorable and exceptional,

223
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,780
hardly the narrow-minded people
you say.

224
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,320
That is why Snow and Sky
did not have an affair.

225
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,280
Snow and Broken Sword
were not enemies.

226
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,200
In other words, your entire story is a lie!

227
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,040
Only one thing was true.

228
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,630
Sky must have known one of you.

229
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,130
Which one?

230
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
You.

231
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,890
I suspect you and Sky were allies.

232
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,890
You were able to defeat him
for one reason only.

233
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,230
What reason?

234
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,730
He lost to you deliberately!

235
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,780
<i>In order to assassinate me,
the two of you staged a fight,</i>

236
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,490
<i>using my guards as witnesses.</i>

237
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,160
<i>Laying this trap was not difficult.</i>

238
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,750
<i>The hard part was in persuading Sky
to place his life in your hands.</i>

239
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,170
<i>Your sword may be swift,
but not enough to defeat Sky.</i>

240
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,800
<i>Yet he willingly fell under your blade.</i>

241
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,550
<i>What courage, what gallantry!</i>

242
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,510
<i>So Sky became your first accomplice.</i>

243
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,190
Sky was a proud man, who regarded
himself without equal in this land.

244
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,650
What made him think that you would
succeed where he had failed?

245
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,360
Unless, in order to assassinate me,

246
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,490
you had spent the last 10 years
honing a unique skill,

247
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,620
a lethal maneuver
that no one can counter?

248
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,170
Having defeated Sky, you could already
come within 20 paces of the throne.

249
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,300
Why did you need
Broken Sword and Snow as well?

250
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:46,390
I suspect you have to be within
10 paces of your target to be effective.

251
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:53,230
So, you required one more accomplice
to help you advance another 10 paces!

252
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,320
<i>I believe that even though
Broken Sword and Snow</i>

253
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,910
<i>had never met Sky.</i>

254
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,990
<i>They understood at once
why he had agreed to your plan.</i>

255
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,340
How far am I from the bookshelves?

256
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,720
- About 10 paces.
- Good. Ten paces it is.

257
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,190
I only need one of you to help me.
Please decide between yourselves.

258
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,860
Tomorrow morning,
at the Qin army encampment.

259
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,870
How swift his sword is!

260
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,710
Yes.

261
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,540
Sky was one of the greatest warriors
of our times.

262
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,960
Yet he was willing
to give his life to this man.

263
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,840
That is why he has the ability
to assassinate Qin's king.

264
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,430
We must go tomorrow.

265
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,260
To go is to die.

266
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,520
Then let us die together.

267
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,330
You are one step ahead of me.

268
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,360
I fear I have inflicted too deep a wound.

269
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,190
I should have been the one to go.

270
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,900
I want you to go on living.

271
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,030
If you died, how could I live?

272
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:36,960
Promise me you will live well
when I have gone.

273
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,670
Say it!

274
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,560
I will.

275
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,280
Moon will soon be here
to take care of you.

276
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,410
I should go.

277
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,510
Your servant Nameless,
the Prefect of Lan Meng.

278
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,590
I have come to Zhao
to catch this assassin.

279
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,130
Please let me fight her alone.

280
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,550
This is a dangerous criminal
wanted by his majesty.

281
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,350
Now that she has been found,
it is my duty to arrest her.

282
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,560
I have a prior agreement
with the assassin to fight her alone.

283
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,690
If I am unable to succeed,
please feel free to step in.

284
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,150
Please grant me permission to proceed.

285
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,230
Unsheathe your sword!

286
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,100
Make your move now!

287
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,990
I die willingly for our cause.
Please make your move!

288
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,500
How swift your sword is!

289
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,780
<i>I suspect you had a battle
with Broken Sword as well.</i>

290
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,610
<i>Like the fight between you and Sky,</i>

291
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,490
<i>you and Broken Sword fought
in the depth of your minds.</i>

292
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,000
<i>Except neither of you
wanted to harm the other,</i>

293
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,790
<i>but were content to go through
the honorable motions.</i>

294
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,170
<i>This was also a tribute to Snow.</i>

295
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,320
Master asked me to give you his sword.

296
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,610
Why has he done this?

297
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,370
Master and Snow will always
be together in life or in death,

298
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,960
and their swords will never be apart.

299
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,140
Master asked me to give you his sword
to help assassinate Qin's king.

300
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,920
<i>Sky, Broken Sword and Snow
gave themselves in different ways,</i>

301
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,260
<i>in order that you could come
within 10 paces of me.</i>

302
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,470
All three were willing
to entrust their lives to you.

303
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,390
Surely one can ask no more of a friend.

304
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,520
That is why you are the most
dangerous assassin of them all!

305
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,500
- How did your majesty figure this out?
- The candle flames in front of me

306
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,580
can sense your murderous intent.

307
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,670
The three of them, and you,

308
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,300
were all willing to die for your cause.

309
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,390
I am ashamed to say
I cannot measure up to your courage!

310
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,560
Your majesty has seen
through our plan.

311
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,230
I have only just worked it out.

312
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,110
Why else would I have allowed you
to come this close?

313
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,200
A man from Qin would never
try to kill me. Who are you?

314
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,530
I am a man of Zhao.

315
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,910
My family was killed by the Qin army.

316
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:25,160
Orphaned, I was taken in
by a family here in Qin.

317
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,420
Ten years ago I discovered
my real identity,

318
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,210
and decided to assassinate you.

319
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,500
So you are here on behalf of Zhao.

320
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,420
I understand now.

321
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,100
I presume you have
perfected a lethal move?

322
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,520
Just as your majesty suggests,
there is indeed such a move.

323
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,850
- And what is it?
- Within 10 paces I cannot fail.

324
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,900
Within 10 paces? I congratulate you!

325
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,400
My guards are outside,
100 paces away,

326
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,900
while you are only 10 paces from me.

327
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:04,160
It would seem that
I shall not escape my fate today.

328
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,500
And yet you hesitate?

329
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,170
Your majesty is most perceptive.

330
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,720
However,

331
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,590
you have also
underestimated somebody.

332
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,140
- Who?
- Broken Sword.

333
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,320
<i>It was imperative that I proved to them</i>

334
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,820
<i>that my sword was not only swift,
but perfectly accurate.</i>

335
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:26,120
Within 10 paces I can strike
with surgical precision.

336
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,370
The sword will enter and exit the body
avoiding all vital organs,

337
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,120
so the wound is deep but not fatal.

338
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:36,540
I respectfully request one of you
to take such a blow from me

339
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,210
in order to deceive Qin's king.

340
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,840
To take such a blow from you
asks a great deal of us.

341
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,970
- How is Sky now?
- Almost fully recovered.

342
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,560
He certainly had faith in your skills.

343
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:54,020
The security around the king is
impenetrable. This is the only way.

344
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,610
The imperial guards
are not worth a mention.

345
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,820
The King of Qin should have died
three years ago.

346
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,240
What happened?

347
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,450
I did not go through with it.

348
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,330
The King of Qin must not be killed.

349
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,830
- Broken Sword said that?
- Yes.

350
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,500
- Why?
- I asked the same question.

351
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,250
What was his answer?

352
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,590
He was unwilling to explain on that day.

353
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,550
Sky, Snow, Broken Sword.

354
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,510
Of the three, only Broken Sword
was my match.

355
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,140
That was why

356
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,060
what he said next

357
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,940
worried me greatly.

358
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,110
As long as I am alive I shall prevent
you from assassinating the king.

359
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,950
I am willing to help you.

360
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:53,580
Three years ago, somebody wasted
a golden opportunity.

361
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,420
This time, we must not fail.

362
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,380
Tomorrow morning, I shall meet you
at the Qin encampment.

363
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,640
I would like to ask a favor.

364
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,600
Help me to fight him now.

365
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,190
Master!

366
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,410
What are you waiting for?

367
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,700
<i>Although I had agreed to help Snow,</i>

368
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,160
<i>it did not seem honorable
to attack Broken Sword.</i>

369
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,710
<i>I found myself unable to make a move,</i>

370
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,170
<i>although we both knew that</i>

371
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:46,380
<i>if we did not stop Broken Sword,
we would have no chance of success.</i>

372
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,660
Moon, stop!

373
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,500
You are no match for him! Let it go!

374
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,190
I knew you would do this.

375
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:10,360
Now you cannot stand in my way.

376
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,570
Even wounded I can still stop you.

377
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,870
In that case I shall have to kill you.

378
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,250
I worry I may have wounded him
too deeply.

379
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:30,340
With mistress' medicine Master
should be out of danger in a day.

380
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,470
- Have you delivered the medicine yet?
- I tended Master's wound myself.

381
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,600
After the duel today, take my sword
and follow the Qin army into court.

382
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,890
I will.

383
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,770
The Qin guards
will not ill-treat a servant.

384
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:50,110
If the assassination is successful,
return with a red flag.

385
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,610
If it fails, a yellow one.

386
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:56,530
If mistress meets with misfortune
at the duel, what would be the point?

387
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,950
When I look down from heaven,

388
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,200
the red flag will bring
a smile to my lips.

389
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,340
- How is Snow?
- She is recovering.

390
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,810
I am here without her knowledge.

391
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,850
You once said as long as you are here
you would try to stop me.

392
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,980
Abandon your plan
to assassinate the king.

393
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,020
- Do you know I am from Zhao?
- So am I.

394
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,190
- Does Qin intend to destroy Zhao?
- Yes.

395
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,860
- Is the King of Qin an enemy of Zhao?
- Yes.

396
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,910
Then whom do you speak for?

397
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:21,570
How can you call yourself
a man of Zhao?

398
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,960
Snow asked me
the same question once.

399
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:37,130
The year we met I was a wanderer
with no home to call my own.

400
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,390
<i>She was the daughter of
the great general Zhao Zhen,</i>

401
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,060
<i>who lost his life
during a battle against Qin.</i>

402
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,730
<i>Snow inherited his sword.</i>

403
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:52,480
<i>She had vowed to avenge her
father's death. I wanted to help her.</i>

404
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,740
<i>Calligraphy and swordplay share
the same source and principles.</i>

405
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,950
<i>So we practiced calligraphy every day,</i>

406
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:04,200
<i>in the hope that it would refine
our skills, and increase our power.</i>

407
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,330
<i>Snow knew I had been rootless
since childhood,</i>

408
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,410
<i>Iiving nowhere and everywhere.</i>

409
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,750
<i>She often said to me, once
we had succeeded in killing the king,</i>

410
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,840
<i>she would take me back to her home.</i>

411
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,920
<i>She said no swords existed there,
and no swordsmen.</i>

412
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,680
<i>There would only be
a man and a woman.</i>

413
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:45,200
<i>The truth of calligraphy
has to be intuitively grasped.</i>

414
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,200
<i>It is the same with swordplay.</i>

415
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,790
<i>Both seek to return
to a state of simplicity.</i>

416
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,250
<i>Gradually I began to understand.</i>

417
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,380
<i>Three years ago,
I reached the peak of my training.</i>

418
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,970
<i>Snow felt it was time
to attempt the assassination.</i>

419
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,930
<i>Together we stormed the palace.</i>

420
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:11,210
<i>Snow asked me
why did I not go through with our plan.</i>

421
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,380
<i>I told her the King of Qin
must not be killed.</i>

422
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:18,680
<i>This was something I had come
to realize through studying calligraphy.</i>

423
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:22,890
<i>Because I spared the king,
Snow turned her back on me.</i>

424
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,570
- Please abort your plan.
- No.

425
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,570
Was all your training
motivated by hatred and revenge?

426
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,490
That's right.

427
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:41,540
For 10 years, I worked relentlessly
without a moment's rest.

428
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:45,080
- What will it take to dissuade you?
- You will have to kill me.

429
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:48,960
- So you are determined to go ahead?
- Yes.

430
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,260
In that case
I shall make you a gift of two words.

431
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,220
These words reflect what is in my heart.
Please think again.

432
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:47,480
Moon, give my sword
to the nameless hero.

433
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,650
Just as Snow and I
will always be together,

434
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,230
our swords will never be apart.

435
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,660
Master Nameless,

436
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,840
even though I am only a lowly servant,
please permit me a few words.

437
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,840
I have served my master
since I was eight.

438
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,180
From him I learnt the martial arts
and how to live with principles.

439
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,640
My master is never wrong.

440
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:29,100
What he wrote must be important.

441
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:32,610
Master Nameless,
please consider his advice carefully.

442
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,660
Which two words
did Broken Sword write?

443
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:53,340
"Our Land."

444
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:57,050
Broken Sword said for years
there has been continuous warfare,

445
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,880
causing huge suffering to the people.

446
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:03,140
Only your majesty has the power
to bring peace by uniting our land.

447
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:07,930
He hoped that for the sake of
the greater good,

448
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:10,350
I would abandon my plan to kill you.

449
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,610
Broken Sword also said,
"One person's pain is nothing

450
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:17,860
"when compared to the suffering of all."

451
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,070
The conflict between Zhao and Qin

452
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,620
is nothing when compared
with peace for all.

453
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,040
Who would have thought an assassin
would understand me the best!

454
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,220
Alone in my position
I have endured endless criticism,

455
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,050
endless attempts on my life.

456
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,810
No one has ever grasped
what I have been trying to do.

457
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:52,810
Even my own court
regards me as a tyrant.

458
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:00,990
And yet, Broken Sword,
a man I barely knew,

459
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:03,530
was able to see clearly,

460
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,870
what is truly in my heart.

461
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,920
I want to know,

462
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,390
without a sword,
how do you intend to kill me?

463
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:28,050
By taking yours.

464
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:45,320
For 10 years this sword
has accompanied me to every battle.

465
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,490
To have been understood
by a man such as Broken Sword

466
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,370
allows me to face death
without fear or regret.

467
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,250
Let the good of our country

468
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:58,420
guide your decision!

469
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,200
I have just come to a realization!

470
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:59,750
This scroll by Broken Sword contains
no secrets of his swordsmanship.

471
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,790
What this reveals is his highest ideal.

472
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:09,800
In the first stage, man and sword
become one and each other.

473
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,470
Here, even a blade of grass
can be used as a lethal weapon.

474
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:18,020
In the next stage, the sword resides
not in the hand, but in the heart.

475
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,390
Even without a weapon,

476
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,690
the warrior can slay his enemy
from 100 paces.

477
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,650
But the ultimate ideal is

478
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,400
when the sword disappears altogether.

479
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,320
The warrior embraces all around him.

480
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,910
The desire to kill no longer exists.

481
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:39,000
Only peace remains.

482
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:09,230
Your Majesty,
I have now completed my mission.

483
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:18,030
Because of my decision today,
many will die,

484
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,990
and your majesty will go on living.

485
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,000
A dead man begs you never to forget

486
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,460
the ultimate ideal for a warrior.

487
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,960
Nameless came within 10 paces
of the king.

488
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,300
He could not have failed.

489
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,760
There can be only one explanation.

490
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,100
He must have given up willingly.

491
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,390
What did you say to him?

492
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:47,520
I wrote two words.

493
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,190
- Which two words?
- "Our Land."

494
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,030
- Is that all there is in your heart?
- There is also you.

495
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,910
- I don't believe you.
- How can I convince you?

496
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,580
Draw your sword!

497
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,800
You have killed Nameless,

498
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,670
betrayed Sky, and destroyed Zhao.

499
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,760
Draw your sword!

500
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:28,810
When we first met,
you asked me to draw my sword then.

501
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:35,770
- Is the sword the only answer?
- I just want you to draw your sword.

502
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,780
Why did you not defend yourself?

503
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,860
So you would finally believe me.

504
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:14,370
I have always wanted
to go home with you.

505
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,210
That will not happen now.

506
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,300
On your own,
you must take good care of yourself.

507
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:43,610
Why didn't you block my sword?

508
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,790
Why didn't you block it?

509
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
Why didn't you?

510
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,000
No more struggle.

511
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,590
I shall take you home now,

512
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,180
to our home.

513
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:45,710
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Permission to execute?

514
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:48,170
Permission to execute?

515
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:51,840
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

516
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,420
Permission to execution?

517
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:16,070
He conspired to assassinate.

518
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,240
This man cannot be trusted!
He tried to kill you!

519
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,370
Do not spare him!

520
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,080
This is the sacred law of Qin!

521
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,420
If your majesty is to unite the land,

522
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,300
this man has to be made
an example of!

523
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,550
Your Majesty, execute him!

524
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:37,590
Your Majesty, execute him!
Your Majesty, execute him!

525
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:41,930
Your Majesty, execute him!

526
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,930
Your Majesty, execute him!
Your Majesty, execute him!
