Monsieur Fowler.

30
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,303
Thank you for coming in.

31
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,097
I'm sorry to ask you at this hour.

32
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,601
I know about as much as you do.

33
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,644
He's an American. He's about 30.

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,855
He works for the Economic Aid Mission.

35
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,899
And I like him.

36
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,068
He's a very good chap. Serious.

37
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,990
Not like those noisy bastards
down at the Continental.

38
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,242
He's a quiet American.

39
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,371
Yes. A very quiet American.

40
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,043
He's dead, isn't he?

41
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,715
Not guilty.
I just put two and two together.

42
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,243
He was killed by a knife.

43
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,082
Can you identify him?

44
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,709
Yes.

45
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,255
He was... a friend.

46
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,842
To tell you the truth,
I'm not completely sorry.

47
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,054
These Americans are causing
a lot of trouble to us.

48
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,392
But still, a murder is a murder.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,852
Anything to help us?

50
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,106
No.

51
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,275
Nothing at all.

52
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,905
Please.

53
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,072
Pyle...

54
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,037
...est mort.

55
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,836
Assassinated.

56
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,134
How?

57
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,721
He was stabbed.

58
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,194
Yes.

59
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,366
He was in love with me.

60
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,453
Yes. He was.

61
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,751
I'm so sorry, Phuong.

62
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,049
I go to my mother's.

63
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,431
I must think.

64
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,987
'I met Pyle
where you meet everybody,

65
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,864
'at the Hotel Continental.

66
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,825
'I'm there every morning at 11.00.

67
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,288
'I'm English. I have habits. I drink tea.

68
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,458
'I'm a reporter, so I listen.

69
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:45,422
'I have a lover. I like to watch her
arrive at the milk bar.

70
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,050
'And there was Alden Pyle.

71
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,595
'A face with no history
and no problems.

72
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,722
'The face we all had once. '

73
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,974
- I'm Alden Pyle.
- I'm Thomas Fowler.

74
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,603
- The London Times.
- You've done your homework.

75
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,396
I've read your articles.

76
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,565
- May I join you?
- Please.

77
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,860
And what brings you to Saigon,
Mr Pyle?

78
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,030
I'm with the Economic Aid Mission,
on the medical side.

79
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,868
Eye disease. Do know trachoma?
It's very common here. Very easy to treat.

80
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,872
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- No. I just dropped by for tea.

81
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,624
On the way to the office.

82
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,168
This is really a stroke of luck for me.

83
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,295
You're one of the few correspondents

84
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,507
who goes out into the field
to see what's happening.

85
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:33,428
Not any more. Besides, I have never
thought of myself as a correspondent.

86
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,389
I'm just a reporter.
I offer no point of view.

87
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,059
I take no action. I don't get involved.

88
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,977
I just report what I see.

89
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:45,148
- But you must have an opinion.
- Even an opinion is a form of action.

90
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,608
Still, I'd appreciate...

91
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,444
'Pyle was hungry for everything
I could tell him about Vietnam

92
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,863
'and her fight for independence.

93
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,741
'Why were the French losing the war?

94
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,035
'And why were the communists winning?

'Then he saw Phuong.

'I should have realised how saving
a country and saving a woman

97

'could be the same thing
to someone like Pyle. '

98
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,425
We've got to contain
communism...

'when I had wanted
to make a difference. '

103
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,272
- To watch liberty snuffed out?
- "Liberty" is a western word.

104
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,899
How do you define it
for the Vietnamese?

105
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,818
The freedom to choose.

106
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,030
OK, you give them that, they vote
and they elect Ho Chi Minh.

107
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,116
Things are more complicated
than they seem.

108
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,328
- What was that?
- A grenade.

109
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,417
- It sounded like a car backfiring.
- A week here, you'll know the difference.

110
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,836
It's been a genuine pleasure
meeting you.

111
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,797
- Maybe we could eat dinner.
- I look forward to it.

112
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,382
Great.

113
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,842
Good morning.

114
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,724
Morning, Hinh. Anything new?

115
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,269
Oh, corruption, mendacity...

116
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,146
I said new.

117
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,106
There is a rumour
that the communists

118
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,276
are planning an attack
in the north, at Phat Diem.

119
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,570
One of your contacts?

120
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,656
Yes, sir.

121
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,702
And a telegram.

122
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,954
- From the London office.
- Mr Stemins.

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,833
He says the paper has conducted
a review of the foreign desk.

124
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,085
He wants you based in London.

125
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,839
Christ.

126
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,175
I thought you liked London, sir.

127
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,428
I do, but I like it just where it is.
I don't want to bloody go there.

128
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,764
For what? A desk job?

129
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,724
They probably think it's cheaper

130
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,268
to let the wire services cover Vietnam.

131
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,520
How many stories
have we given them?

132
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,356
This year?

133
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,900
- Yes.
- Three.

134
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,152
Oh, shit.

135
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,628
Maybe... I should go up there.

136
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,925
- Where, sir?
- Phat Diem.

137
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,346
It's not an easy place to get into,
with the communist attack.

138
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,474
Send a cable to Stemins.

139
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,602
"Understand your current concern.
Stop.

140
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:32,148
"Am working on a story
of major proportions. Stop.

141
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,986
"Suggest I remain in Saigon
until completed. Stop.

142
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,197
"Fowler. "

143
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,826
Which story is that, sir?

144
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,247
I don't know.

145
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:52,460
But I'm sure you know someone
who can get me in there.

146
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,119
Today our anniversary. Did you forget?

147
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,288
Can it be two years already?

148
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,166
- Yes.
- Yes?

149
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,919
Be careful with me. I'm old and fragile.

150
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,922
Not so old.

151
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,261
Not so fragile.

152
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,645
Tom!

153
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,399
Thomas.

154
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,651
- Hello.
- Hello again.

155
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,321
I'm here with some friends.
Care to join us?

156
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,282
- Phuong, this is Mr Pyle.
- Alden, please.

157
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,577
Delighted to meet you too.

158
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,914
Please excuse my bad French.

159
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,501
You know Joe Tunney,
from the American legation.

160
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,796
Yes, I know Joe.
Overthrown any small countries recently?

161
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,258
- Fowler sees conspiracies everywhere.
- That's for sure.

162
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,386
Bill, is it true that the communists
are attacking Phat Diem?

163
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,015
How the fuck should I know?
We only report victories.

164
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,268
One of our medical teams wasn't
allowed past Phnom Penh.

165
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,022
- I was thinking of going up there.
- It's a Catholic town, isn't it?

166
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,943
- You got a date tonight?
- Bill...

167
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,945
She's got a date every night.

168
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,615
You got your piece of ass.
I want mine.

169
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,870
Pyle, fellas, let's go
to the House of 500 Girls.

170
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,622
Oh, no thanks.

171
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:57,418
- I was planning on taking them to dinner.
- We've already booked at L'Arc en Ciel.

172
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,880
That's great.
You go eat at the L'Arc en Ciel

173
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,258
and I'll get eaten next door.

174
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,469
Sounds like a plan. Come on, Bill.

175
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,180
Walk with me.

176
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,822
Seems like a nice young man.

177
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:30,451
- What does he do?
- Something with medical aid.

178
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:38,626
You go and get us a table and
I'll go and rescue our Mr Pyle.

179
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,629
- Merci, monsieur.
- Thank you.

180
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,719
I'm not staying.
Just dropping him off.

181
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,478
Pyle! Let's get out of here.

182
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,400
Put your arm around this one.

183
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,654
If they think you've chosen,
they'll let you go.

184
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,114
- Put your arm around her.
- Excusez-moi.

185
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,621
- Night, Granger!
- Who wants the money most?

186
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,013
Miss Phuong, please forgive us
for keeping you waiting.

187
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,473
I forgive you.

188
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,268
- We had to make sure Bill got home.
- Home!

189
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,646
- Number 30?
- Sorry?

190
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,984
Tickets for the taxi dancers.
You buy a ticket for a dance.

191
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,238
Buy a ticket. Maybe I dance with you.

192
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,493
There you are.

193
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,163
Shall we?

194
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,053
Phuong is a very beautiful name.

195
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,724
Phuong. It mean phoenix.

196
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,310
Oh.

197
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,522
I thought it meant flower.
Like the ones in your hair.

198
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,983
Do you like my hair?

199
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:53,905
- This is traditional style.
- It's very nice.

200
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,908
- Do you know Vietnamese?
- Sure. Try me.

201
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,163
When you dance,
don't try to lead.

202
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,125
No. I don't...

203
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,127
I only know two words.

204
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,881
Beer and... hair cut.

205
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,552
- Mr Fowler.
- Hello.

206
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,138
- May I?
- Of course.

207
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,182
Thanks.

208
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,143
Haven't seen you for a long time.

209
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,687
- I'm away a lot.
- Yes.

210
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,986
Who's he? Your friend?

211
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,031
His name is Pyle. He's with
the American Economic Mission.

212
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,784
He's from Boston. In America.

213
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,911
He's a very bad dancer.

214
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,579
Yes.

215
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:54,590
- He is married?
- Not that I know of, no.

216
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,345
This is Phuong's sister. Alden Pyle.

217
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,931
Very happy to meet you.

218
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,727
Your father is a businessman?

219
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,064
No. He's a professor.

220
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,609
My sister is very good dancer, yes?

221
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,946
- She's too good for me.
- She's my only sister.

222
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,200
He's cute, the American.
And money too.

223
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,662
Sometimes you're as vulgar
as the French you hate so much.

224
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,040
Your sister's a very pretty girl.

225
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,420
My sister is the most
beautiful girl in Saigon.

226
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:37,550
I don't doubt that at all.
Mr Fowler's a very lucky man.

227
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,138
My father was very sad
he had no grandchildren.

228
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,058
Would you like a drink?

229
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,060
No. Thank you.

230
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,855
My friends.

231
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,567
So pleased to have met you.
I hope we meet again soon.

232
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,737
- Perhaps you could arrange.
- When I get back from the north.

233
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,822
You are going north?

234
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,115
Yes.

235
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,286
Then you must come
and have dinner

236
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,998
with me and my sister
when Mr Fowler is gone.

237
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,960
- To cheer her up.
- Thank you. I'd like that very much.

238
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,011
- What a nice woman.
- Absolute saint.

239
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,640
She used to work in office.
Import-export.

240
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,059
- Really?
- She knows shorthand.

241
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,270
- Does she?
- Maybe you need someone.

242
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,357
Maybe we could work something out.

243
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,449
Please forgive me for dancing
with Miss Phuong so many times.

244
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,661
- I like watching her dance.
- She's a very good dancer.

245
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,789
She should be.
She used to do it for a living.

246
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,293
- What do you mean?
- She was a taxi dancer.

247
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,255
A hostess. Here at the Arc en Ciel.

248
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,716
I thought you said
she came from a good family.

249
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:05,554
She did, but the father died
so the sisters had to earn a living.

250
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,683
- Well, that's too bad.
- What?

251
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,727
Isn't that just a step up
from the girls across the street?

252
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,690
Good God, no. It took me six months
to get her to go on a date.

253
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,072
- Grenade.
- A grenade.

254
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,662
- Are you married?
- Yes, I am.

255
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,670
But not to her.

256
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,296
There's something I haven't told you.

257
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,844
I got a telegram from the paper,
asking me to go back to London.

258
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,057
So will you go?

259
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,185
I've cabled them,

260
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,271
asking them to let me stay, but...

261
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,401
If they stop paying me,

262
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,279
I'm not sure how we'll live.

263
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,034
I come with you to London.

264
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,912
I'd marry you if I could.

265
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,542
- You know that.
- Yes.

266
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,421
That's what I always tell my sister.

267
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,144
You think your wife will give divorce?

268
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,859
I doubt it.

269
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,747
'When did everything change?

270
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,252
'Maybe there isn't one moment.

271
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,966
'The cable from London
calling me home?

272
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,136
'Or watching them dancing together?

273
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,639
'Or what followed between us,
she and I,

274
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,016
'through the long night?

275
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,818
'I was never brave.

276
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,864
'But there I was, heading north,

277
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,658
'the fear of losing Phuong
more terrifying

278
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,369
'than the fear of any bullet. '

279
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,297
The communists attacked four days ago.

280
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,133
We pushed them back only yesterday.

281
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,511
We think there is 300 in this village.

282
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,892
- But you will not see them.
- It's getting worse, isn't it?

283
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,394
How long can you keep going?

284
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,605
A few months, maybe.

285
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,399
My men are counting bullets.

286
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,080
Silence!

287
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,961
Quick! Hide!

288
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,132
Quickly, hurry!

289
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,191
No, no! Don't shoot!

290
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,568
Pyle?

291
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,073
What the hell are you doing here?

292
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,325
They wouldn't let my truck
out of Phnom Penh

293
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,036
so I figured I'd see
what was going on for myself.

294
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,790
You're lucky to get here alive.

295
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,380
It wasn't that hard after I hired a boat.
It wasn't expensive.

296
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,924
- In the end I just bought it.
- You are mad.

297
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,259
- I'm mad?
- Yes.

298
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,553
Have you ever seen anyone
with trachoma?

299
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,931
- Yes, I suppose I have.
- It's not that easy to remain uninvolved.

300
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,809
Here, this way.

301
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,562
"'Not that easy
to remain uninvolved. "

302
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,485
'I had hidden for so long
behind a typewriter.

303
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:20,160
'What we found there,
what we saw, in Phat Diem...

304
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,371
'... what did that do?

305
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,834
'To his zeal, to my detachment?

306
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,379
'The dead are not involved.

307
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,174
'The dead have no zeal.

308
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,177
'They are lying in wait.

00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,599
'You see them, all their tenderness,

00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,019
'and then they haunt you. '

311
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,190
- Communists?
- This is not the work of French soldiers.

312
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,694
It doesn't make sense.

313
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,156
The communists don't kill townspeople.

314
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,827
- It is not in their interest.
- Maybe another faction.

315
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,038
There are so many of them.

316
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,333
Each with their own army.

317
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,930
What's that book
you're always reading?

318
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,725
York Harding,
"The Dangers To Democracy".

319
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,519
- An American?
- Yeah.

320
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,064
He was out here a couple of years back.

321
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,691
- Was he here long?
- I don't know.

322
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,361
I heard him lecture once.
Joe actually met him.

323
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,364
He put forward the idea
of a third force to run Vietnam.

324
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,700
- Not the communists, not the French.
- Not the Americans?

325
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,203
No. We're not colonialists.

326
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,914
Something that could
really help these people.

327
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,501
- You have a gun, either of you?
- No.

328
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,170
They shall attack again tonight.

329
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,714
You don't want to be taken alive.

330
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,008
Believe me.

331
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,345
Shoot yourselves.

332
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,098
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

333
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,850
Stay inside that bunker.

334
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,702
- Do you want something to eat?
- No, thank you.

335
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,913
Come on.

336
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,084
You didn't come up
to check your medical team.

337
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,338
Joe Tunney sent you, right?
A little intelligence work.

338
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,222
I've never have been very good
at keeping secrets.

339
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,892
There is another reason
why I came up here.

340
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,357
- It's you.
- Me?

341
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,360
Yeah.

342
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,740
You said that you might be
coming up here.

343
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,462
The thing is, it's about Phuong.

344
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,798
Well, I guess it started
that night when we were

345
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,301
at the Arc en Ciel
and I was dancing with her.

346
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,554
I didn't think you ever got
close enough.

347
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,141
And then I had dinner
with her and her sister

348
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,395
that Saturday and...

349
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,151
...just when I was sitting
there looking at her,

350
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,654
it all just became so clear to me.

351
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,073
I see.

352
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,493
Look, Tom,
none of this was planned.

353
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,495
There's no way...

354
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,957
I never ever used to believe in
love at first sight.

355
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,002
But after seeing those other girls
in that awful place

356
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,798
and thinking that Phuong
could easily become one of them,

357
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,467
I want to protect her.

358
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,345
What did she say when you
offered her your protection?

359
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,680
- I haven't told her yet.
- You haven't?

360
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,017
No. I didn't think it would be right.
I wanted to speak with you first.

361
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,148
Look, if you two were married
that would be completely different.

362
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,526
I can never marry her. Oh, shit!

363
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,821
My wife would never give me a divorce.
She's a Catholic.

364
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,453
They're getting closer.
They're walking in.

365
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,313
'Dear Thomas, I guess
I'll be back in Saigon ahead of you.

366
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,984
'And I wanted to reassure you

367
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,904
'that I won't go to see Phuong
until after you return.

368
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,031
'If you can make
the next transport out,

369
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:11,243
'you should be back
by the end of the week.

370
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,746
'I can check in with your assistant
to see if you made it.

371
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,001
'If so, I'll come around
to see you both together on Friday.

372
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,128
'Say 5.00? '

373
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,006
Anyone due to go out to Hong Kong?

374
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,592
Someone from Reuters, I believe.

375
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,678
Type this up and ask him
to cable it to London for me.

376
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,763
- Your big story?
- Yes.

377
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,350
Massacre at Phat Diem.
Nobody did it, of course.

378
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,728
Not the French,
not the communists...

379
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,522
But there are rumours.

380
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,360
- What's going on?
- I forgot.

381
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,738
- What?
- It's a rally.

382
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,116
- A new political party.
- Bloody hell.

383
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:55,120
I think I'd better leave your car here.
We can walk.

384
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,492
- Isn't that Colonel Thé?
- General Thé.

385
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,577
- Who made him a general?
- He did.

386
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,997
He broke away from the French
and formed his own army.

387
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,702
- Hello.
- Hi.

388
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,747
You have a dog.

389
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,835
- Come in.
- Thanks.

390
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,928
- Where's Phuong?
- She's gone to see her sister.

391
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,847
Oh.

392
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,643
- Would you like a whisky?
- Just a soda, thanks.

393
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,524
Does he have to do that?

394
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,360
Duke! Come here.

395
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,071
- You called him Duke.
- Yeah.

396
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,866
I found this guy in the street.

397
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,870
Didn't I? Who could turn
their back on a mug like that?

398
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,373
I saw you and Joe Tunney
at the parade.

399
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,667
Did you go on to the rally?

400
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,421
Thanks. Yeah, I did.
It was really something else.

401
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,841
I thought only American politicians
went in for that nonsense.

402
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,926
All that was missing
was the ticker tape.

403
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,763
They sure didn't forget
the brass band.

404
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,682
Impressive guy, that General Thé.

405
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,477
It doesn't trouble you that
he's a complete egomaniac?

406
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,856
Look, I don't want to talk
about Phuong behind her back.

407
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,859
I thought she was going
to be here, but...

408
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,654
- Her sister told me of her predicament.
- And what predicament is that?

409
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,157
I think you know.

410
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,284
You can't marry her,

411
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,497
and by living with you she can never have
a proper marriage to a Vietnamese man.

412
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,708
She doesn't need a proper marriage
with a Vietnamese man.

413
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,211
She's with me.

414
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,338
Here she is.

415
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,216
Hello, Phuong.

416
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,676
My sister is out.

417
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,514
- Hello.
- Hello. It's nice to see you.

418
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,768
It's you that Mr Pyle
has come to visit, Phuong.

419
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,770
So why don't we all sit down?

420
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,147
Unless, of course,
you want me to leave.

421
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,274
No. That wouldn't be right.

422
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,611
We should sit down, then.

423
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,249
Fire away.

424
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,712
Phuong...

425
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:40,887
Ever since I met you
and danced with you and talked with you,

426
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,351
I haven't been able to get you out of
my thoughts for more than a moment.

427
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,193
I've fallen in love with you.

428
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,076
You fall in love with me?

429
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,997
Please believe me.
I've never behaved like this before.

430
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:12,169
I apologise. It is abrupt
and it is ill-mannered, but...

431
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,673
I'm in love with you.

432
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,428
Shouldn't you be on one knee?

433
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,560
Look... Phuong,
I'm not a rich man

434
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,187
but I do have assets.

435
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,606
- Let's toss for her.
- What can you offer her?

436
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,443
- Oh, Christ.
- I don't expect you to love me right away.

437
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,987
You could always make love
to the chauffeur.

438
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,656
You have no right to insult her!

439
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,242
- Shut your bloody dog up.
- Come away with me.

440
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,370
Tell him to bugger off
and take his dog with him.

441
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,209
No.

442
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,924
Did you say no?

443
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,260
Yes. Sit down and have a scotch.

444
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,804
No. I should go. I'm so sorry.

445
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,557
- Do you want to smoke a pipe?
- A pipe?

446
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,643
Opium.

447
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,270
No. Why would I do that?

448
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,875
'I know before we married
you warned me

449
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,712
'beliefs meant that
there could never be a divorce.

450
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,967
'All the same,
that's what I'm asking for now.

451
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,512
'The fact is,
I love someone very much.

452
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:50,141
'I want you to feel affection
and act before you have time to think.

453
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,312
'Just cable and tell me you agree. '

454
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,532
I've just asked my wife for a divorce.

455
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,789
Your sister...

456
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,127
Was she really out?

457
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,005
I told you.

458
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,469
I thought perhaps she sent you back

459
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,306
so that you could meet Pyle.

460
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,058
He's very young.

461
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,688
That's not so important.

462
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,786
Good news. They printed your story.

463
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,875
I got a cable from Stemins.
This got me a month's reprieve.

464
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,588
Page 10.
"French Break Communist Siege. "

465
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,134
They didn't use much, did they?

466
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,846
Nothing here about
the villagers that were killed.

467
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,765
What did the French papers say?

468
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,226
Headlines blame it
on the communists, of course.

469
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,438
Well, a month is a month.

470
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:23,109
What else can you tell me
about this General Thé?

471
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,531
He's set himself up against both
the French and the communists.

472
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,496
Do you think he'd give me
an interview if I went up there?

473
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,414
Difficult to say.

474
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,043
Perhaps if he thought
he could get his message across.

475
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,837
The problem would be
getting it past the censor.

476
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,007
No, the real problem would be
to get close to the Cambodian border

477
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,592
and back before dark.

478
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,512
The communists control
that road at night.

479
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,223
So many Europeans
have been killed out there.

480
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,195
I am Thomas Fowler
of the London Times,

481
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:12,325
and I'm here to interview General Thé.

482
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,789
I'm Thomas Fowler
of the London Times.

483
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,751
I'm here to see General Thé.

484
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,931
'September,
October, November...

485
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,560
'I'd seen Pyle only once since
he'd asked Phuong to marry him,

486
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,687
'at the Continental.

487
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,730
'He'd been polite, of course,

488
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,067
"'how was I, how was Phuong?

489
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,736
'He'd been busy, he said,
out of the city,

490
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,823
'working on his medical programme.

491
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,868
'Though somehow,
wasn't surprised to see him.

492
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,955
'I was surprised
to be pleased to see him. '

493
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:03,293
- What brings you out to these parts?
- I was hoping to interview the General.

494
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,296
But they've thrown me
out of the place.

495
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,341
- What's your excuse this time?
- This is like a test run for us.

496
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,095
The French, in their typically French way,
have been very uncooperative,

497
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:18,766
but General Thé has been good enough
to let us set up camp here.

498
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,686
I'll get them to let you in.
C'est bon.

499
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,690
Joe Tunney's running aid programmes
with business people close to Thé.

500
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,817
- Mr Muoi.
- Mr Pyle.

501
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,279
- Hello. How are you?
- Good.

502
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,553
My name is Mr Muoi.
The General only has a few moments.

503
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,097
May I first ask you
a question?

504
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,851
- Please.
- What is your relationship to the General?

505
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,562
I'm a businessman and a patriot.

506
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:11,152
Many of the supplies and aid you see
are the result of my efforts.

507
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,112
Shall we begin
with the first question?

508
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,240
You say you've broken away

509
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,410
from the French and Vietnamese
forces with which you serve.

510
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,579
Do any ties remain?

511
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,294
The French are colonialists.

512
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,881
Not to be trusted.

513
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,598
It will take an independent
Vietnamese leader to rule our country.

514
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,102
How does the General expect
to launch a successful campaign

515
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,230
against the larger forces
of the communists and the French

516
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,524
with so few men and supplies?

517
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,904
And who is providing the means
for the General to achieve this?

518
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,292
Has he been fighting his war
in the north?

519
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,687
There was a massacre at Phat Diem.

520
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,606
Were your forces present?

521
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:48,249
Regrettably the General has just recalled
that he has an urgent appointment.

522
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,460
- So, please.
- Thank you.

523
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,682
That was quick.

524
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,519
Things didn't go entirely
according to plan.

525
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,356
Watch yourself with Joe.

526
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,484
I think he's up to something
with General Thé.

527
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,864
Can I get a ride to Saigon with you?
Something's wrong with my car.

528
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,908
Yes, of course you can.

529
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:26,496
Hello. Some kind soul
has had mine cleaned.

530
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:39,467
I heard a rumour that
you'd been recalled to London.

531
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,596
Really? Who told you that?

532
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,099
Phuong's sister.

533
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,315
- Shit.
- What is it?

534
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,026
We're out of petrol.

535
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,446
Some bugger up in the mountains
must have siphoned it off.

536
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,087
They might have some spare petrol
in that watchtower.

537
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,975
Is anybody there?

538
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,607
It looks like it's deserted.

539
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,860
I'll go in and have a look.

540
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,079
Hello?

541
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,291
Is anyone there?

542
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,768
My car below has run out of gas.

543
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,856
- Do you have any gas to sell?
- No.

544
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,943
- Is everything OK?
- Come up.

545
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:27,116
Then my friend and I will have
to stay here until morning.

546
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,413
It's not allowed.

547
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,625
My friend.

548
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,650
It's OK. Please, lower your guns.

549
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,445
Please lower them. He's a friend.

550
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,806
What are you thinking?

551
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,396
I was wondering
what she was doing right now.

552
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,867
This morning she met
her friends for elevenses

553
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,327
at La Fontaine.

554
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,873
Ice cream and the latest gossip.

555
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,128
On her way home,
she stopped at the market

556
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,463
for fresh fish for dinner.

557
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:11,679
And now she's flipping through
the pages of magazines,

558
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,267
looking at photographs
of the royal family and film stars,

559
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,064
listening to Bach's
"Well-Tempered Clavier".

560
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,153
I just got her started on Bach.

561
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,162
Have you had a lot of women,
Thomas?

562
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,418
You start out by being promiscuous,

563
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,213
and end up like your grandfather,

564
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,965
faithful to one woman.

565
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,512
I know I'm not essential to Phuong.

566
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,100
But believe me when I tell you that

567
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,395
if I were to lose her,

568
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,232
for me...

569
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,987
...it would be the beginning of death.

570
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,457
Somebody's had it.

571
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,087
There are 30 or 40 of these towers
between here and Saigon.

572
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,299
They only hit one or two a night
so our odds aren't too bad.

573
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,681
So what do you think they'd do
if the communists attacked?

574
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,809
These two?
They'd fire a shot and run.

575
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,854
Why should they die for us?
Or the French.

576
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,693
What's that?
I thought I saw something.

577
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,367
Christ, they're here!

578
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,918
As far as I can make out,
he told them to give us up or else.

579
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,094
Stop! Give me that!

580
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,263
Come on, Thomas.

581
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,232
- What is it?
- I think I've twisted my ankle.

582
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,154
I'm gonna head up the road
to the next watchtower.

583
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,033
See if I can find a French patrol.

584
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,036
Sit tight, OK? I'll be back.

585
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,288
May I introduce myself?
Thomas Fowler.

586
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,766
Thomas! Thomas!

587
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,269
I found a patrol.

588
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,771
If I had died...

589
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,650
...you could have had her.

590
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,204
And I think you should
inform your sources

591
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,458
that General Thé has a lot more men
than the hundred of their last count.

592
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,378
He's a story we should take seriously.

593
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,881
Never underestimate a patriot, sir.

594
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,427
What do you know about Muoi?
Could he finance Thé's army?

595
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,888
He owns a bicycle factory!

596
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:09,226
Well, I think Joe Tunney
is plotting with both he and Thé.

597
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,062
And it's more than just
foreign aid programmes.

598
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,899
I'll see what I can find out, sir.

599
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,906
Things are under control at the office.

600
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,450
- Try to get some rest.
- Thank you, Hinh.

601
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,070
- I missed you.
- Ow!

602
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,948
- Are you all right?
- I'm all in one piece.

603
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,285
- You got a letter from London.
- Yes?

604
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,747
- I fetch it for you?
- No. Give me a kiss.

605
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,166
Big one.

606
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,630
I will get it.

607
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,976
You look afraid.

608
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,604
I think I'd better have
a brandy and soda.

609
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,129
Pyle. Come in, come in.

610
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,926
Thought I'd drop by,
see how you were doing.

611
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,346
- Very well, thanks.
- How's the leg?

612
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,225
My tennis game will suffer,
but it wasn't much to begin with.

613
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,147
Ah. Thank you.

614
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,399
I'm glad you dropped by.

615
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,528
We have to thank Mr Pyle,
Phuong, for saving my life.

616
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,200
Thank you.

617
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,119
How's your sister doing?

618
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,038
- Sister?
- Yes.

619
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,916
Alden got her a job with Americans.

620
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,460
Oh, yes?

621
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,379
She likes it very much. Thank you.

622
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,757
Good. I'm very glad.

623
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,843
Since you're both here,
now is as good a time as any

624
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:52,348
to tell you that I have received
a letter from my wife

625
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,143
and she has more or less agreed
to give me a divorce.

626
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,106
Ow!

627
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,818
That's wonderful.

628
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,744
- Come sit.
- Thank you. I've got plans.

629
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,746
Thank you for dropping by.

630
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,792
Bye.

631
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,646
Sir, I...

632
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,652
I trusted you, Thomas.

633
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,739
Always a mistake
when there's a woman involved.

634
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,866
Couldn't you have won without lying?

635
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,661
What is it, anyway?

636
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,455
My sister read the letter from your wife.

637
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,749
I show it to her,

638
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:05,504
because... I was so proud.

639
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,841
- So happy.
- How could you treat her like this?

640
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,848
"Dear Thomas,
you always picked up women

641
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,225
"like you picked up mud on your shoes. "

642
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,894
I'm sorry, Phuong.

643
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,523
- So then why'd you lie to her?
- Because I wanted to keep her.

644
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,358
That's not love.

645
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,652
See, he doesn't even deny
he's a liar.

646
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,533
"Have you ever stopped to think
how lonely she'll be in England

647
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,076
"especially when you leave her?"

648
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,245
Shut up, for Christ's sake.

649
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,749
"I don't believe in divorce.

650
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:48,589
"My religion forbids it.
And so the answer is... no. "

651
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,012
I was taught never to read
other people's letters.

652
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,348
- I was taught not to tell lies.
- Come on, Phuong.

653
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,479
I don't speak Vietnamese.

654
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,648
Get lost!

655
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,950
You were right about Muoi.
He does have connections.

656
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,411
Can we discuss this some other time?

657
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,414
Crates from overseas have been
moving through his factory,

658
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,708
bypassing French customs.

659
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,003
My sources have been unable
to determine what they contain.

660
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,633
He's probably got someone
on the take.

661
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,344
He's an exporter, not an importer.

662
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,555
Yes, well, we'll do that tomorrow, OK?

663
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,308
No. A shipment just came in
this afternoon.

664
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,685
It could be gone by the morning.

665
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,293
What are you doing here?

666
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,588
I'm looking for Monsieur Muoi.

667
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,757
He's not here.

668
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,053
He invited me to visit him here.

669
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,849
I'm a British journalist.

670
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,602
A friend of General Thé.

671
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,564
Where is Monsieur Muoi?

672
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,318
- What is this Diolacton?
- We must leave immediately.

673
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,653
Crazy British, they drink too much.

674
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,449
He's nobody, he's no one.

675
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,453
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your life. Go!

676
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:55,484
Phuong?

677
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:07,871
Good morning.

678
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,666
- Can I help you?
- You've done quite enough already.

679
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:16,713
- Where's Pyle?
- He's not in the office this morning.

680
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,675
- He does a lot of work at home.
- I know what he does at home.

681
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,595
- What do you mean?
- Ask her. She's fixed him up with my girl.

682
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,682
- We can't have scenes in the office.
- I know I am behaving badly.

683
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,267
But I have every intention
of behaving badly.

684
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:33,730
This is exactly the kind of situation
where one should behave badly.

685
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,775
- Could we please lower our voices?
- Why don't you bugger off?

686
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,777
Thomas, there is a lady here.

687
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,113
This lady and I know
each other quite well.

688
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,574
She tried to get a rake-off from me,
but now she's getting one from Pyle.

689
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,161
- We have a lot of work to do.
- If Pyle phones, tell him I called.

690
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,206
It would be polite to return the visit.

691
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,545
How did he get in here?

692
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,793
This is Boston?

693
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,672
No, that's Niagara Falls. So is that.

694
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,302
This is Boston. That's Faneuil Hall.

695
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,223
I can't wait to take you to my country.

696
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,904
My friend from school.

697
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,366
She go to airport with her boyfriend.

698
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,580
He said he'd take her to France.

699
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,004
But in the airport,

700
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:25,258
he disappear, leave her there.

701
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,137
So many girls with French boyfriend,

702
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,184
no one to marry them.

703
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,813
Well, that'll never happen to you.

704
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,163
I promise.

705
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,553
- Hi.
- Have a nice Christmas?

706
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,847
One long party.

707
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,266
Did Phuong forget something?

708
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,852
Heard you came by the legation.

709
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,770
Yes.

710
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,731
- Who's this?
- Bodyguard. We all have them now.

711
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,150
Are you married yet?

712
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,279
No, I figured I'd wait until we got home
and do it properly.

713
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,031
You don't mind living here improperly?

714
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,076
It's hard to talk
if you're going to be so cynical.

715
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,912
I meant it'd be good to do it
with my parents there.

716
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,917
I had a cable from head office.
They want me back.

717
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,752
Oh, that's...

718
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,921
So it's good that
Phuong went off with you.

719
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:49,301
She might have ended up as another
piece of arse for someone like Granger.

720
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,928
At least I know you'll treat her right.

721
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:56,892
So does this mean
that we can still be friends?

722
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,060
I don't see why not.

723
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:11,698
So what is Diolacton, anyway?

724
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,701
- You know about that?
- Shouldn't I?

725
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,829
Well... Diolacton is
a milk-based plastic.

726
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,916
It's used for the frames
in the eyeglasses.

727
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,919
Are you still in touch
with General Thé?

728
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,380
- We keep the channels open.
- And Muoi?

729
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,925
Mr Muoi's helped
get our supplies through customs.

730
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,845
- The French have started to charge for...
- You asked me for advice once.

731
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,265
Here it is. Leave the bloody
third force to Joe,

732
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:41,186
forget York Harding,
and go home with Phuong.

733
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,943
And would you shut the door
on the way out, please?

734
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:07,087
Morning, Larry.
What is it today?

735
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,631
You know,
some cockamamie assignment.

736
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:19,224
We should go. Joe Tunney said
to be out of here by ten to eleven.

737
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,518
- What is it, anyway?
- I'm not sure.

738
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,355
- Is it a demonstration?
- I don't know.

739
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:18,992
My friend is in there.

740
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,149
Did you cut your hand, sir?

741
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,699
Yes.

742
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,371
- How is it down there?
- 30 dead.

743
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,583
Probably 20 more by morning.

744
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:37,213
They've started arresting
communist sympathisers.

745
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,008
There was a woman.

746
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,386
With a baby.

747
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,685
She covered it with her hat.

748
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:07,410
This man... he died.

749
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,372
Right in front of his family.

750

Pyle...

751
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,056
Did you see him?

752
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,229
He spoke Vietnamese.

753

Vietnamese.

754
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:45,240

you know, native language.

Murray! Come over here! Get this.

756

Move it. Right here. On this side.

01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,979
Suppose you invite him to dinner
at the Vieux Moulin,

792
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,315
say between 9.00 and 9.30.

793
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:29,237
It's quiet near there.
My friends can speak to him undisturbed.

794
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,116
Maybe he's engaged.

795
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:39,831
At 6.30, my contacts will have someone
in the street outside your apartment.

796
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:45,336
All you have to do,
if you decide to invite him to dinner,

797
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,464
go to the window and open a book.

798
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,512
What will they do to him?

799
01:13:54,638 --> 01:14:00,476
I promise you, my contacts will act
as gently as the situation allows.

800
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,983
Sooner or later, Mr Fowler,

801
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:12,780
one has to take sides
if one is to remain human.

802
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,180
'I need to speak to you
about what happened this morning

803
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:40,183
'in the Place Garnier. '

804
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:09,754
- Phuong.
- A letter for you.

805
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,299
Thank you.

806
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:16,135
Just give me a few minutes, all right?

807
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,181
Come in.

808
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,312
I got your message.

809
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,398
So I see.

810
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,990
- I'd love a drink.
- I've only got hard liquor.

811
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:24,161
You're probably on duty. I've noticed
you're rarely off duty these days.

812
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,248
Whisky'd be fine. People change.

813
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:31,502
Or maybe they just never were
what we thought they were.

814
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,007
Who of us is, Thomas?
Who of us is?

815
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:48,519
- You want to talk about General Thé?
- Yes. And Mr Muoi.

816
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,606
And Diolacton.

817
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:59,947
- We met with Thé this afternoon.
- He's in Saigon?

818
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,241
Come to see
how his explosives worked?

819
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:05,494
You know, his original target
was a military parade.

820
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,913
We were pretty tough on him.

821
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,915
Did you tell him
you wouldn't support him?

822
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,500
We told him
if he steps out of line again...

823
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,086
He tried to kill you
on the road to Saigon.

824
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:17,465
No. He tried to kill you.

825
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,552
You knew?

826
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:25,181
I suspected he might try something.
Or one of his officers.

827
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,558
So I tagged along just in case.

828
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,311
You're a fool if you think
you can control General Thé.

829
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,813
In a war,
you use the tools you've got.

830
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:35,316
Right now, he's the best we have.

831
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:38,611
And in the meantime,
even more people must die.

832
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,614
Last year the US government
gave $210 million

833
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,325
in military assistance
to the French in Indochina.

834
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:48,746
If we are going to stop communism
and underwrite a third way,

835
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,999
we need to give the people
a leader who they admire.

836
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,086
Tomorrow when Congress sees
the photographs

837
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,798
of the communist atrocities,
they are going to give us that support.

838
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,800
The French won't stop the communists.

839
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:04,136
They haven't got the brains
and they haven't got the guts.

840
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,850
How did I fit into all this?

841
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,396
Am I part of your cover?

842
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,857
Or a source of information?

843
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,946
Or did you have your eye
on Phuong all the time?

844
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:25,991
You and Phuong? I never planned
for any of that to happen. Believe me.

845
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:29,745
It would've been easier
if I'd never met either one of you.

846
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:34,250
- But you did. And you lied to us.
- What do you want me to tell you?

847
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:38,546
That I took no action?
That I have no opinion?

848
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:44,552
Tell me that you don't mean
any of this.

849
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,097
Tell me that you were only
obeying orders.

850
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:51,892
Or tell me that after what you saw
in the square, those children,

851
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:53,894
who did nothing and hurt no one,

852
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,439
tell me that you were
so confused and horrified

853
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:00,067
at how brutal and insane
these actions are.

854
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:03,779
Tell me how your love for Phuong
has caused you to have some doubts.

855
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,783
But it's because of Phuong
that I am even more determined.

856
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:13,080
Let's just look at Phuong. There's beauty.
There's daughter of a professor.

857
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,750
Taxi dancer.
Mistress of an older European man.

858
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,335
That pretty well describes
the whole country, doesn't it?

859
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:22,840
Look, Thomas, we are here
to save Vietnam from all of that.

860
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:25,009
What happened in the square
makes me sick.

861
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,928
But in the long run,
I'm going to save lives.

862
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,933
It's you, isn't it?

863
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:36,896
Joe Tunney,
the staff at the legation,

864
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,148
Mr Muoi, General Thé.

865
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:44,278
They all take their fucking orders
from you, Pyle.

866
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:48,949
York Harding prattles on about a third
force in that book you carry around.

867
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:53,078
You've actually gone out
and made one.

868
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:57,166
I don't think you see
the big picture, Thomas.

869
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,170
No, I do not see the big picture.

870
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:13,974
Do you know this poem?

871
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,770
"I walk down the street
and I don't give a damn

872
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:21,315
"The people, they stare
and they ask who I am

873
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:25,236
"And if by chance
I should run over a cad

874
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:29,532
"I can pay for the damage,
if ever so bad. "

875
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:34,328
We can disagree and remain friends,
can't we, Thomas?

876
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,627
Yes.

877
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,213
Look, I'm sorry.

878
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,883
Let's have dinner
and put all this mess behind us.

879
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:53,013
- 9.00, Vieux Moulin. OK?
- That sounds great.

880
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,100
I miss our conversations.

881
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,310
Vieux Moulin it is.

882
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:03,691
All right, then. I'll tell Phuong
she can have dinner with her sister.

883
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,527
I'll get her to meet me here
afterwards.

884
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:16,453
Look, if you can't make it,
come straight here.

885
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:19,456
- I'll wait for you.
- All right.

886
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,917
I'll see you soon, Thomas.

887
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,109
Walk.

888
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,122
I need to talk to somebody
who speaks English.

889
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,292
You see,
it's my son's birthday tonight.

890
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,720
We need to ask you
some questions.

891
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:41,473
I'm from the American legation.
I just try and help people see.

892
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:47,646
The thing is, I...

893
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,316
...I got a cable from my wife.

894
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:59,908
My boy has polio.
They don't know if he's going to make it.

895
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:05,497
I don't care if he's crippled.

896
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,791
I just don't want him to die.

897
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,377
I'm sorry. I've just got to get some air.

898
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,897
Throw him in the river.

899
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:44,054
'At least 2,000 people
were killed and scores of others injured.

900
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,808
'In the wake of last week's
devastating bomb blast in Saigon,

901
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,643
'French officials report... '

902
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:54,731
Phuong?

903
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,236
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

904
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:01,613
would you mind to come
downstairs with me?

905
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:06,326
- What do you want?
- I have something to show you.

906
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:12,457
It seems Monsieur Pyle came
to see you the night he died.

907
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,878
- So what, Vigot?
- You said he did not.

908
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:22,885
By the way, we found Pyle's dog.

909
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,387
They cut its throat.

910
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,684
You see here?

911
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:34,146
Pyle's dog had cement
between its toes.

912
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,691
This was poured
on the afternoon of his murder.

913
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:39,860
So what does that prove?

914
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,324
And the patron
of the Vieux Moulin told me

915
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:50,078
that night you asked
for a table for one.

916
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,830
Not two.

917
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,752
I have nothing more to add
to my original statement.

918
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,506
Nothing?

919
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,764
You know I didn't kill him, Vigot.

920
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,730
There's a war on.

921
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:18,774
People are dying every day.

922
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:42,983
Ask another girl.

923
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,278
I don't want another girl.

924
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,770
Will you come back now, Phuong?

925
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,482
- Will you come back to me?
- To London?

926
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:27,277
No. Not to London.

927
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,865
Then I don't come back.

928
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:33,700
Please. I...

929
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,746
I can't take you to London.

930
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:41,041
Because I'm not going.

931
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,711
I'm not leaving you.

932
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,345
Never.

933
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:58,475
Will you come back to me?

934
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,763
- Will you take down my hair?
- Yes.

935
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:57,868
Do you miss him?

936
01:31:05,334 --> 01:31:06,751
Yes.

937
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,255
I'm sorry.

938
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:15,260
Why are you sorry?

939
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,596
I don't know.

940
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,558
I just feel that...

941
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:24,936
I ought to apologise to... someone.

942
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,901
Not to me.

943
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,403
Never to me.

944
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,664
'They say
you come to Vietnam

945
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:48,877
'and understand a lot
