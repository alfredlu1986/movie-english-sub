- Yeah, Quinn?

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,247
Keep 'em at it.
No slacking!

175
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,248
You heard him.
No slacking.

from the Earth, Quinn,

180
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:42,259
- no weapon could save me!
- Yeah.

Me and a few others,
we're going harvesting, Quinn.

No, you're not.

Half the stuff's not ripe. You
pick it now, it won't germinate.

191
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,713
That means no seeds. That means
nothing to plant next season.

192
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,113
There won't be a next season.
We'll be starved to death.

What is this?
We can do it, Eddie.

194
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:36,143
We decided, all of us,
you as well...

195

to you, and for what?

201
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,436

buried on the road.

202

I'm not losing these, Quinn,

- Give me the keys.
- You bloody take 'em from me.

207
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:10,179
It's a community, not a prison.

208
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,285
Eddie... you can argue
as much as you like.

209
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,293
It makes no difference.

210
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,829
The point is,
if you go out those gates,

211
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,524
then you jeopardize
this community...

212
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,896

Only one thing worse
than a dragon...

508
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:42,394
Americans.

509
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:49,945
Oh, what a dump.

510
00:30:55,352 --> 00:30:58,446
Who's in charge?!

511
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,888
[Sniffs]

512
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,153
Well, that would be you, then.

513
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:18,903
Anything happens,
you know what to do.

514
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,638
Uh, no.
I have no idea.

515
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:24,609
Me neither.

516
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,292
[Breathing heavily]

517
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,734
That's a big tank.

518
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,638
[Latch clicks, hinges squeak]

519
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,007
[Door slams]

520
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:01,143
You responsible for this place?

521
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:02,276
Who are you?

522
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:04,718
Name's Van Zan,
Kentucky Irregulars.

523
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,629
You're a long way from home,
Van Zan. You lost?

524
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:12,584
Rebuilt a National Guard C5A.

525
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:15,791
Flew it 8,000 miles on 2 engines
and tried to set it down

526
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:19,597
on the old strip
outside of Manchester.

527
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,969
Lost 1 22 men
and most of my fuel.

528
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
We need shelter and a place
to refit artillery.

529
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:28,304
We'll be out of your hair
by 1 800 hours tomorrow.

530
00:32:28,378 --> 00:32:30,744
That's a good story, especially
the bit about the plane,

531
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:33,146
but there hasn't been anything
in the air for 20 years.

532
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,410
That's their territory.

533
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:38,479
It's my territory.
It's your territory.

534
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:39,817
They're just rentin' it.

535
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,152
Turn around, Van Zan.

536
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,863
Don't be a fool.

537
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,196
We can do this easy...

538
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,434
or we can do it real easy.

539
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:05,875
You try it.

540
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:13,485
You ever seen one of these?

541
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:15,889
Not many men have.

542
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,223
Got it off the first one
I killed.

543
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,021
The plane was better.

544
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,762
So now you're a dragon killer.

545
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,861
That's not even original.

546
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,530
It was in a wheat field

547
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:33,201
just south of Coffeyville,
Kansas.

548
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,244
It was late November.

549
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,246
It's a month of mist.

550
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:39,509
And we were caught in the open.

551
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,710
The sun was setting behind us.

552
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:43,878
There was nowhere to run.

553
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:45,615
Twice it came in on us,

554
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:48,487
and twice it missed
the heart of us.

555
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:56,191
And that's when I had
an epiphany.

556
00:33:56,266 --> 00:34:01,761
You see, they have
great vision... in the day.

557
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:06,502
And they have
even better vision at night.

558
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:09,670
But in the failing light,
they can't focus.

559
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:14,113
Magic hour.

560
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,824
Coffeyville.

561
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,732
It's etched in American history

562
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:35,499
because the outlaw Dalton boys
were killed there.

563
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,132
Ordinary townsfolk rose up
and took 'em down.

564
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:43,105
Maybe you're the Dalton boys.

565
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:48,709
No, no...
we're the townsfolk.

566
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:53,186
[Wind whistling]

567
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,625
You try anything...

568
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:03,131
I'll kill you.

00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:52,547
Well... I'm sure you've got

575
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:55,517
a perfectly good
explanation for this,

576
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,519
but I'm buggered
if I know what it is.

He's a dragon slayer!

Oh, he's a dragon slayer.

582
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,759
Oh, good.

583
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,562
And I suppose that makes you
King Arthur, does it?

584
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:13,933
Christ Almighty, Quinn.

585
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:15,995
I mean,
even if you believe that,

586
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,063
and you'd have to be
an imbecile,

587
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,941
do you not think we'd be easy meat for these guys?
- You weren't there.

588
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,273
Look at this guy.
Look. Look.

589
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:24,643
I mean, he looks like... like a...
like a rogue Marine.

590

You remember those guys?
Oh, yeah, sure.

591
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,881
They blew up plenty of dragons
in their time,

592
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:31,386
but they also took
half the world...

I saw his eyes, Creedy!

once they jump from the chopper,
that's their life expectancy.

615
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:14,184
You never thought
of giving them parachutes?

616
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:16,225
They're not much help.
They're bulla men.

[Chuckles] What?

618
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:22,590
They were used by gladiators
to snare other men.

619
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,328
Not men, dragons.

620
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:29,168
So, you guys, uh,
jump out the chopper

621
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,436
and use a net to snare dragons?

622
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:34,033
Mm-hmm.

00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,805

that's what you're looking for.

Sure.

643
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:50,743
Is that your son?

644
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,347
No.
Got him from the pound.

645
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,619
Hmm. Is that where you
get all your children?

646
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:04,631
I found him in a village
near Bray.

647
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,135
3 years old,
sitting with his mum.

648
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:09,433
He kept trying to wake her up.

649
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,701
She had been dead for days.

650
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:17,905
We were making our way up here, a few of us...
me, Creedy, and Barlow.

00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,972
No idea how
we were gonna survive.

652
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:23,644
Anyway, I grabbed him.

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,381
What else was I gonna do?

654
00:40:25,455 --> 00:40:27,685
Leave him.

655
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,725

especially back
in the early years.

Everybody's just running
for their lives.

Yeah.
Well, I didn't.

659
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,830

of course.

At that rate, we might just be getting
somewhere in about 320 years.

When this thing is over,

she's gonna build a wall
with those things.

gonna be a very long wall.

Alex, tell him.

00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:45,737
- Did you see the one we brought down, the big bull?
- Yeah.

894
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:48,174
Well, it wasn't.
It was a female.

895
00:55:48,243 --> 00:55:51,144
There was at least one egg,
probably more.

896
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:54,808
We've hit over 200 of them,
and as far as we can tell,

897
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,544
they're all females.

898
00:55:56,618 --> 00:55:59,280
How about you, Quinn?
You ever seen a male?

899

Well, we have.

903
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:07,891
Alex discovered it
about two years back.

904
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:10,464
She worked out how
the fire in the glands...

905
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:13,228
Two glands in the mouth secrete
separate chemicals, yep.

That's right.

We figure they're like fish.

One male passes over
and fertilizes thousands.

913

[Smacks lips] Did you hear
what she said, Quinn?

914
00:56:31,787 --> 00:56:33,152
One male.

915
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:35,918
That's why we never see any
others, 'cause there's only one.

916
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:37,925
Now, we tracked the
epidemiology of these things,

917
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:39,551
and we found out
where they're from.

918
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:40,890
And that is why we're here.

We kill the male,
we kill the species.

Good luck.
It's that way.

00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:53,301
No, I need soldiers.

00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,538
- Quinn, are you listening to me? I need men...
- Men from Pembury went to London.

924
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:59,103
And maybe she's right, because
they disturbed something.

925
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:00,273
90 of them died,

926
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:02,340
and then it backtracked them
to their fortress.

927

And you haven't seen destruction
like that, Van Zan...

You're just letting them
die slower.

I said no.

935
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,624
I made a mistake letting you
through those gates.

936
00:57:19,701 --> 00:57:22,397
I saw something in your eyes. I
thought it was awe. I was wrong.

It's madness.
You're insane.

00:57:58,106 --> 00:58:01,803
My mother was working on a railway tunnel...
project engineer.

944

There's nothing magical
about 'em.

They're made up
of a collection of organs.

and a liver.

could be good coverage.

Here's the plan...

when we get to street level, we gotta
bring that bull's ass to the ground,

and I'm gonna take care
of that.

He only exposes his chest
before he breathes fire.

Now, these are magnesium-tip

and they only fly
about 50 feet.

It's about 1 00 meters across.

There's a building right
in the middle.

No.

to come to London.

- How?
- We're gonna split up.

1320
01:27:26,112 --> 01:27:28,376
We stay together, take
a hit, and we're gone,

1321
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:29,972
so we gotta use every angle.

1322

Now, Quinn, you're gonna
take that west wall.

Okay. What about you?

1325

I got the north.

Alex, I need you
to stay right here.

01:27:42,729 --> 01:27:45,630
Now, when Quinn and I make a
move, it's gonna draw him off,
