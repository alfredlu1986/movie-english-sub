1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,299
Okay, you ready for this?

2
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,343
As ever.
Let's do it.

3
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,471
Let's play Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

4
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,393
Who wrote the phrase "No man is an island"?

5
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,522
John Donne? John Milton?

6
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,858
John F. Kennedy?

7
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,402
Jon Bon Jovi?

8
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,238
Jon Bon Jovi. Too easy.

9
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,492
And, if I may say so,
a complete load of bollocks.

10
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,162
In my opinion, all men are islands.

11
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,500
And what's more, now's the time to be one.

12
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,419
This is an island age.

13
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,589
A hundred years ago,
you had to depend on other people.

14
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,717
No one had TV or CDs or DVDs or videos...

15
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,468
or home espresso makers.

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,470
Actually, they didn't have anything cool.

17
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,555
Whereas now, you see...

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,183
you can make yourself a
little island paradise.

19
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,102
With the right supplies
and the right attitude...

20
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,105
you can be sun-drenched,
tropical, a magnet...

21
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,608
for young Swedish tourists.

22
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,861
Hi, it's Kristina.
I haven't heard from you.

23
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,865
I had a great time last weekend.
So give me a call, okay? 'Bye.

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,119
And I like to think that perhaps
I am that kind of island.

25
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,955
I like to think I'm pretty cool.

26
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,791
I like to think I'm Ibiza.

27
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,928
There were people who had
a good time in life.

28
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,014
I was beginning to realize
I wasn't one of them.

29
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,891
I just didn't fit.

30
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,809
I didn't fit at my old school.

31
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,687
I definitely didn't fit at my new one.

32
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,942
I heard that some kids
got taught by their parents at home.

33
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,569
Mum couldn't do that,
unless I paid her to teach me.

34
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,822
Because it was just her and me.
And she went to work.

35
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,866
She made400 a week.

36
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,118
Where was I gonna get
that kind of money from?

37
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,247
Maybe if I was like that movie kid,
Haley Joel Osment...

38
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,998
I could pay her that much.

39
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,584
But if that meant being
good at drama, forget it.

40
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,919
I was crap at drama.

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,380
'Cause I hated standing
up in front of people.

42
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,091
So, basically, I had to go to school.

43
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,483
The sad fact is that,
like any island dweller...

44
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,404
from time to time I had
to visit the mainland.

45
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,124
This is lmogene.
You can hold her if you like.

46
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,961
That's.... Well, okay.

47
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,258
Yeah. Got her. Lovely.

48
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:42,306
Yeah, she's delightful, isn't she?

49
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,641
I know. Isn't she?

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,272
To tell the truth,
I'm being crap with her.

51
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,608
You better take her back.

52
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,613
She could've been yours
if you got your act together.

53
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,781
Just think of that, yeah.

54
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,869
So, the place is looking really nice.

55
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,996
Barney, Barney, Barney.

56
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,290
Say hello to Will, Barney.

57
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,251
Here we go. It's the Antichrist.

58
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,879
Hello, Barney. How are you?

59
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,799
- He's lovely.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,887
And what about you, Will?
Any desire for a family of your own yet?

61
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,722
I'd rather eat Barney's nappies.

62
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,099
Not really. I'm sort of all right as I am.

63
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,768
Please, Will.

64
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,479
What does that mean? "Please" what?

65
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,855
Look at yourself.

66
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,400
You're 38 and you've never had a job...

67
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,487
or a relationship
that lasted longer than two months.

68
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,280
I wouldn't exactly say you were okay.

69
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,700
I mean, I would say you were a disaster.

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,204
I mean, what is the point of your life?

71
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,539
Bloody hell.

72
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,333
You're right.
There's probably no point to my life...

73
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,627
but thank you for bringing it up.

74
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:58,966
The reason we wanted you to come here today
was we wanted to ask you...

75
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,637
how would you like to be
lmogene's godfather?

76
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,349
Seriously?
Seriously.

77
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,395
Listen, I'm really, really touched.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,605
But you must be joking.

79
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,776
I couldn't possibly think
of a worse godfather for Imogene.

80
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,445
You know me.
I'll drop her at her christening.

81
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,867
I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th,
when I'll take her out and get her drunk...

82
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,328
and possibly, let's face it,
you know, try and shag her.

83
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,042
I mean, seriously, it's a
very, very bad choice.

84
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,254
We know, I just thought
you had hidden depths.

85
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,382
No. No. You've always had that wrong.

86
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,217
I really am this shallow.

87
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,555
Here we are.

88
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,393
You know you don't have to walk me
to school anymore now, Mum.

89
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,312
I know the way now.

90
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,481
But what if I like walking you to school?

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,030
Right.

92
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,157
Who are you?

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,325
I'm me.

94
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,285
And what are you not?

95
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,369
A sheep.

96
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,580
Right. And what does a sheep go?

97
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,050
Marcus?

98
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,930
I love you.

99
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,432
Look.

100
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,559
I love you, too.

101
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,320
"I love you, Marcus!"

102
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,116
"Love you!"

103
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,536
Look at him!

104
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,376
While I couldn't accept the offer...

105
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,419
to become their child's godfather...

106
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:04,341
I did allow them to set me up with Angie,
a rather beautiful coworker of Christine's.

107
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,053
They had, however, being them,
neglected to tell me one thing.

108
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,598
There's something you don't know about me.

109
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,517
Yeah?

110
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,938
Something exciting?

111
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,817
I think so, yes.

112
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,028
I have a 3-year-old boy.

113
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,951
I wanted to throw the napkin on the floor,
push over the table and run.

114
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,829
Brilliant. I love kids.

115
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,250
Yeah. I like messing about with them.

116
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,085
Doing kid things.

117
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,422
I'd have been disappointed
if you didn't have a child.

118
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,382
Why do you say that?

119
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,176
God knows.

120
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,721
Mainly because it sounded
smooth and winning.

121
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:56,310
Because I love kids so much.
They're so lovely.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,606
What in God's name are you saying,
you idiot?

123
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,817
She can't be buying this rubbish.

124
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,780
But she did buy my rubbish.

125
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:12,492
And for the next few weeks
I was suddenly Will the Good Guy.

126
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,579
Her kid took to me,
mainly because on our first meeting...

127
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,082
I took him to the zoo
and held him upside down by his ankles.

128
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,710
I wish relationships
with proper humans were that easy.

129
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,545
You know, you are brilliant.

130
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,923
I came to realize that with single mums...

131
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,175
particularly ones who'd
been badly treated...

132
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:33,972
and eventually abandoned by the father of
their children, you became by comparison....

133
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,308
You are a wonderful person.

134
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,186
No, I'm not.

135
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,855
But it was hard
to be wonderful all the time.

136
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:46,568
Eventually I began to wonder whether
Angie was exactly what I was looking for.

137
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:51,281
For instance, she was late for the new IMAX
movie because the babysitter hadn't turned up.

138
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,534
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.

139
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,826
That pissed me off.

140
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,953
- You okay?
- Yes.

141
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,080
And there were deeper problems.

142
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,334
She couldn't stay at my place, and she
didn't have a DVD, or satellite or cable.

143
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,797
So we were always stuck watching some crap
made-for-TV movie about a kid with leukemia.

144
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,550
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do.

145
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,970
Godl Nol Please, please, nol

146
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,264
I was going to have to end it.

147
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,015
But having been Will the Good Guy...

148
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:21,895
I didn't relish going back to my role of Will
the Unreliable, Emotionally-stunted Asshole.

149
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,105
I'm sorry?

150
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,275
You're breaking up with me? You...

151
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,819
self-centered bastard.

152
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:33,240
I can't believe I've wasted
all this time with you!

153
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,870
You useless, superficial loser.

154
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,085
Will....

155
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,045
Then something magical happened.

156
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,218
I'm not sure this is working out.
It's not you.

158
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,556
You've been great. It's me.

159
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,060
Well, my situation with Louie and his dad.

160
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:06,273
I'm not ready to launch into a relationship
with anybody new.

161
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,074
Yeah.

162
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,993
I'm so sorry.

163
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,165
I think I understand.

164
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,044
You're a wonderful man, Will.

165
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,675
I'd never watched a woman
cry without feeling responsible before.

166
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,221
She even wanted me to forgive her.
It felt amazing.

167
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,266
Listen, you don't have anything
to feel sorry about. Really.

168
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,646
So that was the end of Angie,
but the beginning of a whole new thing.

169
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,772
Single mums.

170
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,316
Why hadn't anyone told
me about them before?

171
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,403
Passionate sex, a lot of ego massage
and a guilt-free parting.

172
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:57,824
There must be thousands, just waiting for a
nice guy to sleep with and break up with.

173
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,911
Fabulous, sexy, gorgeous single mums.

174
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,791
Can I have Cocoa Puffs?

175
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,626
No, it's not Sunday.

176
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,879
The crying had started again.
And it scared me...

177
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,966
'cause now it was in the mornings.

178
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,093
She'd never done that before.

179
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,224
I couldn't figure it out. Nobody was dead.

180
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,895
She had a job as a music therapist,
which is kind of a teacher for sick kids.

181
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,606
So there was enough money
for food and everything.

182
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,441
Should I get my own breakfast?

183
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,277
No, I'm doing it.

184
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,955
So, you looking forward to school today?

185
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,377
Today, you'll need to effect...

186
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,422
the decimal point when
you multiply it by 10...

187
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,841
100 and 1000.

188
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,679
"Nothing to do but frown

189
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:06,185
"Rainy days and Mondays always get me down"

190
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,066
Thank you very much, Marcus.

191
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,329
Hi, Nicky. Hi, Mark.

192
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,916
- Are you going to Computer Club later?
- I don't know. Marcus....

193
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,085
Madonna! Go on, give us a song!

194
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,670
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

195
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,672
Spice Girls or something. Three of them.

196
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,090
Yeah. Hey, Spice Girls.

197
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,804
You made me lose my football.

198
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:48,227
Marcus, we don't really want you
hanging around with us anymore.

199
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,812
- Why not?
- Well, it's because of them.

200
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,190
- They've got nothing to do with me.
- Yes, they do.

201
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,777
We never had trouble with them
before we started hanging out with you.

202
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,238
Now we get it every single day.

203
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,865
Besides, everyone thinks you're weird.

204
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,700
Only a bit, though.

205
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,329
Okay.

206
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,208
'Bye.

207
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,174
There you have it.

208
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,554
I was having a shit time at home
and a shit time at school.

209
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,185
It was fine deciding
single mums were the future...

210
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,272
but the frustrating truth was
I didn't have their numbers.

211
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,607
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

212
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,487
Where did they hang out?

213
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,512
I'm a single father,
I have a 2-year-old boy.

214
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,806
I'm a single father, I
have a 2-year-old boy.

215
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm a single father, I
have a 2-year-old boy.

216
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,978
I'm a single father, I
have a 2-year-old boy.

217
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,730
SPAT.

218
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,273
This was exciting.

219
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,109
A potential gold mine of single mums.

220
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,279
I could see the beautiful creatures now,
getting roaring drunk...

221
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,324
forgetting their troubles,
ready to rock and roll.

222
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,826
That was when
I was 7 months pregnant.

223
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,289
By the time I had the baby,
he was in Majorca with another woman.

224
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,793
Not even the one
he cheated on me with the first time.

225
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,714
Well, with me, it was the
week before the birth.

226
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,967
He said I'd got too fat.

227
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,930
Mine was shagging his secretary.

228
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,098
Such a cliche.

229
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,435
I'll tell you one thing: Men are bastards.

230
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,853
After about 10 minutes...

231
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,232
I wanted to cut my own penis off
with a kitchen knife.

232
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,402
Me.

233
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,362
Yes.

234
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,533
I have a 2-year-old. Ned.

235
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,748
He's got blue eyes
and sort of sandy-colored hair...

236
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,042
and he's about 2'3".

237
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,504
And his mum left.

238
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,632
- Really?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,636
Yeah, I mean,
obviously it was a very big shock...

240
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,305
because we were so happy, you know?

241
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,976
Sandra's neurology practice
was just up and running...

242
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:39,189
and then one day her bags were packed,
and my best friend was waiting outside...

243
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,732
in his Ferrari.

244
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,526
Yeah. You know, the Modena?

245
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:47,698
The one with the supercharged engine, where
you can see it through the back window?

246
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,286
- You got dumped then?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,376
May I ask, does your ex see Ned at all?

248
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,922
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

249
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,340
Suzie.

250
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:06,884
Suzie.

251
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,928
She doesn't see much of him, no.

252
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,472
How does he cope with that?

253
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,349
He's a very good little boy.

254
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,727
Very, very brave.

255
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,146
They've got amazing resources, don't they?

256
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,857
Just the other day I was
thinking about my ex.

257
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,528
He came crawling up, put his little
pudgy arms around my neck, and he said:

258
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,614
"You hang in there, Dad."

259
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,575
God, that's amazing for a 2-year-old!

260
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,952
Is it?

261
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,416
Yeah, he's very special.
Very, very special.

262
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,461
Sometimes I think, you know,
he's the one taking care of me.

263
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,088
Teaching me the ways of the world.

264
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,675
Sorry.

265
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,847
Thank you.

266
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,059
My God, what a performancel
I was even fooling myself.

267
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,108
There you go. You okay?

268
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,568
Yeah. Perfect, thanks.

269
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,153
- Trust me?
- Of course.

270
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,948
By the end of the evening,
I had a date lined up.

271
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,033
Single parents alone together!

272
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:17,412
Single parents alone togetherl
All for one and one for alll

273
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,794
The problem was I also had
an imaginary 2-year-old son.

274
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,662
The date was a SPAT picnic in Regent's
Park, with everyone bringing their kids.

275
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,622
Sadly, Ned couldn't be there.

276
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,375
His mum had come
and picked him up at the last second.

277
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,043
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

278
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,336
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,798
- Got it.
- This is Megan, by the way.

280
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,425
Hello, Megan.

281
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,384
Yeah.

282
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,887
A friend of mine from SPAT
isn't feeling so great...

283
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,681
so I said that we'd take her kid
to the picnic, too.

284
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,850
- ls that all right?
- Yeah.

285
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,394
The more the merrier. Right.

286
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,271
Come on, slowcoach!

287
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,234
I hated that SPATlot.

288
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:34,656
Mum's friend Suzie was fine, but now there was
that wally who wanted to get off with her.

289
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,700
Marcus, Will. Will, Marcus.

290
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,452
Hi there.

291
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,079
Right.

292
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:46,210
Pile in, everyone.
Look what a mess Ned made of the car seat.

293
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,671
What a shame he can't come.

294
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,924
So, what do you do?

295
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,634
Me?

296
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:58,430
There were too many lies
to keep track of so I told the truth.

297
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,975
- Nothing.
- Well, before then.

298
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,395
- What do you mean, before I did nothing?
- Yeah.

299
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,397
I did nothing.

300
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,526
You've never worked?

301
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:15,322
I've done the odd day
here and there, but, no.

302
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,367
Crazy, isn't it?

303
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:19,785
It's....

304
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,165
Brilliant.

305
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,253
My God, I was going to have to tell her.

306
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:34,132
What happened, in fact,
was that my dad wrote a song...

307
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:38,095
in 1958, and it's quite a famous song...

308
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,598
and I basically live off
the royalties of that.

309
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,058
You know Michael Jackson?

310
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,018
He makes a 1,000,000 a minute.

311
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,354
That's 60,000,000 an hour.

312
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,231
I don't make a1,000,000 a minute.

313
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,149
- Nothing like, sadly.
- How much then?

314
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,359
Marcus!

315
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:56,446
I was beginning to wonder if we'd be
stuck with this weird kid all day.

316
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,657
So, what's this song then?

317
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:02,536
If you can live off it,
we must've heard of it.

318
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,080
It's Santa's Super Sleigh.

319
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,374
God, please don't sing it.

320
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:13,046
"Look who's coming round the bend
It's Santa and his reindeer friends

321
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,968
"With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, hey,
It's Santa's super sleigh"

322
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,263
I expect people do that all the time.

323
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,057
No, I think you two are the first.

324
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:28,103
Sorry. I don't understand.
How does that make you money?

325
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,647
Do carol singers have
to pay you 10 percent?

326
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:34,234
They should, but you can't
always catch the little bastards.

327
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,487
So, how often do you look after him?
Marcus.

328
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,656
Every once in a while.

329
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,784
His mum's a little off-color sometimes.

330
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,329
You call it off-color, I call it nuts.

331
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,874
She's not nuts, Marcus.
She just needs a weekend taking it easy.

332
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,836
We'll have a nice picnic, and when
you get home, she'll be all rested up.

333
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,756
My God! What the hell is that?

334
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,633
My mum's homemade bread.

335
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,720
It looks pretty good.

336
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,931
No, it isn't. It's healthy.

337
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,097
You miss him, don't you?

338
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:47,891
Who?

339
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,270
Ned!

340
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,105
Yeah.

341
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,024
Yeah, very much.

342
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,818
He'd have loved this.

343
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,573
I think I killed a duck.

344
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,161
I was only trying to feed it.

345
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,331
What's that floating
in the water next to it?

346
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,333
Is that your mum's bread?

347
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:17,087
You didn't have to throw the whole loaf.
That would've killed me.

348
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,133
You the one who was throwing
bloody great loaves at the ducks?

349
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,219
Yeah, he was, but I've stopped him now.

350
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,722
You know, boys will be boys, and all that.

351
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:27,764
So he killed it.

352
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,976
No. Sorry, I misunderstood you.
The duck was dead already.

353
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,854
He was throwing bread
to try and sink the body...

354
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,440
because Megan here was getting upset.

355
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,154
Marcus wouldn't kill a duck.
Would you, Marcus?

356
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:46,116
No. I love ducks. They're my
second favorite animal after dolphins.

357
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,952
They can kill sharks with their noses.

358
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,749
I'll have to wade in and get it.

359
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,211
Listen, I hope it's not
some sort of epidemic.

360
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,590
I think we beat the rap there, mate.

361
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,009
Yeah. Well.

362
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,971
Marcus?

363
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,603
Mum.

364
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,368
That day, the Dead Duck Day,
was when it all began.

365
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:34,373
That bloke Will just followed us in
and I didn't tell him not to.

366
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,794
Afterwards, I realized that there was no
way I could have been nervous just then...

367
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,840
because just then I didn't know
there was anything to be nervous about.

368
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,884
But then I put the key in the lock,
opened the door....

369
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,177
Are you decent?

370
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,264
And a new part of my life started.

371
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,515
Bangl

372
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,814
Jesus Christ.

373
00:23:58,981 --> 00:23:59,982
Oh, my God.

374
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,944
- Will, call an ambulance.
- Marcus, where's the phone?

375
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,197
Where's the phone, mate?

376
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,924
It was horrible. Horrible.

377
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,970
But driving fast behind the ambulance
was fantastic.

378
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:31,847
She's conscious.

379
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,099
She was okay in the ambulance.

380
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,684
She was asking after you, Marcus.

381
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,561
That's nice of her.

382
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:42,441
Listen, you know this has
nothing to do with you, don't you?

383
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,777
I mean, you're not the reason that she....

384
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,865
You're not the reason that she's here.
Isn't that right, Will?

385
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,620
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,956
I'll go get you some water.

387
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:01,210
- I can get that.
- No, you're okay.

388
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,761
Your mum's going to be okay.

389
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,221
Yeah, I suppose.

390
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,474
That's not the point, though, is it?

391
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,644
Right, you mean you're afraid
she might try again?

392
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,646
Just shut up, all right?

393
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,566
There you go, warm and flat.

394
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,276
Are you with Fiona Brewer?

395
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,778
Yes, I'm her friend Suzie.

396
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,656
This is Marcus and Will.

397
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,408
She's recovering well,
but we'll keep her overnight.

398
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:38,413
I'm going to get a consent form for Ms. Brewer
so the boy can stay with you two tonight.

399
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,873
Right.

400
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,545
So, my place or yours?

401
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,255
Sorry.

402
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,644
Okay.

403
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,397
- I should get back to Ned, I think.
- I'll take that.

404
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,815
All right.

405
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,984
All in all, this was very interesting.

406
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,194
So I'll call.

407
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,780
But I wouldn't want to do it every night.

408
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:12,948
See you soon.

409
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,118
The thing is,
a person's life is like a TV show.

410
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,579
I was the star of The Will Show.

411
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:21,874
And The Will Show wasn't an ensemble drama.

412
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,585
Guests came and went,
but I was the regular.

413
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:27,087
It came down to me, and me alone.

414
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,549
If Marcus' mum
couldn't manage her own show...

415
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:34,678
if her ratings were falling,
it was sad, but that was her problem.

416
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:39,892
Ultimately, the whole single-mum plot line
was a bit complicated for me.

417
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,571
I got the letter. Thanks.

418
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,743
Oh, my God. I'd forgotten.

419
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,329
You forgot?

420
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,039
You forgot a suicide letter?

421
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:29,543
I didn't think I'd have
to remember it, did I?

422
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,842
Did you read the part
where I said I'd always love you?

423
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,970
It's a bit hard for you
to love me when you're dead, isn't it?

424
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,430
I'm sorry.

425
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,816
I can understand why you're angry, Marcus.

426
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,617
I don't feel the same as I did yesterday,
if that's any help.

427
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,659
What?

428
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,953
It's all just gone away? All that?

429
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:06,496
No, but...

430
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,084
at the moment, I feel better.

431
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,337
"At the moment" is no good to me.

432
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:17,132
I can see you feel better at the moment.
You just put the kettle on.

433
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:21,303
But what happens when you finish your tea?
What happens when I go back to school?

434
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,890
- I can't be here to watch you all the time.
- I know.

435
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:30,062
We have to look after each other.
The two of us.

436
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:34,858
Suddenly I realized
two people isn't enough.

437
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,568
You need a backup.

438
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:39,947
If you're only two people,
and someone drops off the edge...

439
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,573
then you're on your own.

440
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:43,367
Two isn't a large enough number.

441
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,410
You need three, at least.

442
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,455
- Three what?
- Nothing.

443
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,749
But I'd had a great idea.

444
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,462
The important thing in island living
is to be your own activities director.

445
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,340
I find the key is to think of a day
as units of time...

446
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:01,802
each unit consisting
of no more than 30 minutes.

447
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,263
Full hours can be a little
bit intimidating...

448
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,807
and most activities
take about half an hour.

449
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,642
Taking a bath: One unit.

450
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,602
Watching Countdown:

451
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,062
Okay....

452
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,522
One unit.

453
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,483
Web-based research:

454
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,152
Two units.

455
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:22,739
Exercising: Three units.

456
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,410
Having my hair carefully
disheveled: Four units.

457
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,662
It's amazing how the day fills up.

458
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,873
I often wonder, to be absolutely honest...

459
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,625
if I'd ever really have time for a job.

460
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,587
How do people cram them in?

461
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,343
Yeah, Will here.

462
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,762
It's Marcus.
Pardon?

463
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,181
It's Marcus.

464
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,432
Marcus?

465
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,518
Marcus. Hi.

466
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,396
How'd you get my number?

467
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,564
From Suzie.

468
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,567
I thought you'd like to take me
out for the day on Saturday.

469
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,527
And why did you think that, Marcus?

470
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:02,321
Suzie said we hit it off.

471
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:04,198
Did she?
Yeah.

472
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:07,242
- And you said, "See you soon."
- I said what?

473
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,327
"See you soon."

474
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:12,206
The night you dropped us off. Remember?
You said, "See you soon."

475
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:16,335
This is soon, all right, Marcus.

476
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,880
The thing is, mate,
my life is kind of hectic at the moment.

477
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,049
Why? I thought you did nothing.

478
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:27,095
I've got Ned and stuff to look after.

479
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:30,974
Matter of fact, I should be on the way
to preschool right now.

480
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,309
What's that noise?

481
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,977
That's a lawn mower.

482
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,813
So, you know, just time-wise it's not....

483
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,568
Tell you what, just hold the line one sec.

484
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,487
Hold on, one sec. Thanks.

485
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,614
But then I thought, "Why not?"

486
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,450
Why shouldn't I take
the poor little sod out for a meal?

487
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,828
I could be Uncle Will.
Cool Uncle Will, King of the Kids.

488
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,457
Okay, Marcus. You're on.

489
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,543
I'll come if you take my mum, too.

490
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:01,630
She has no money, so we'll have to go
somewhere cheap or you'll have to treat us.

491
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,132
Listen, don't beat about the bush, Marcus.

492
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:07,219
Why should I? We're poor.
You're rich. You pay.

493
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,137
Bring your little boy, I don't mind.

494
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:10,597
That's really big of you.

495
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,766
Fine. Come round at 12:30 or something.

496
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,101
Remember where we live?

497
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:18,522
Flat 2, 31 Craysfield Road,
Islington, London, N12SF.

498
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,190
England, the world, the universe.

499
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,901
Yeah.
Marcus?

500
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,201
So, Fiona, how are you?

501
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:37,165
- I mean, how are you feeling?
- My stomach's fine.

502
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,459
Great.

503
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,422
I must still be a bit barmy, though.

504
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,633
This kind of thing doesn't
go away overnight, does it?

505
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:48,635
No.

506
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:55,350
If Mum was going to get Will to marry
her, she'd have to quit making jokes.

507
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:56,560
At least she looked good.

508
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,353
I had her put on that nice hairy jumper...

509
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,440
and the earrings she got from her friend
that went to Zimbabwe.

510
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,859
The kid seemed to think
this was a date.

511
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,236
As for his mum, she was clearly insane...

512
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,489
and appeared to be wearing
some kind of Yeti costume.

513
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,784
This had better be quick.
We were definitely not ordering starters.

514
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,494
I'll start with the artichoke, please.

515
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,706
Then I'll have a mushroom omelet with fries
and a Coke.

516
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,792
- I'll have the vegetable platter.
- We're vegetarians.

517
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,127
I'd never have guessed.

518
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,588
Steak sandwich, please, mate. Thanks.

519
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,427
This was going really well.

520
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:34,556
I wondered if we were going to move into
Will's place or move into someplace new.

521
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,979
"I heard he sang a good song

522
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,650
"I heard he had a style"

523
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,112
I knew, of course,
the song couldn't last forever...

524
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,782
that I'd soon be at
home, tucked up in bed.

525
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,326
I knew it, but I couldn't feel it.

526
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:59,122
"And there he was, this young boy"

527
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:02,626
I must've been insane.
All I'd wanted was a date with Suzie.

528
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,169
This was my punishment.

529
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:08,549
"Strumming my pain with his fingers"

530
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,886
The worst part was
when they closed their eyes.

531
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,931
"Killing me softly with his song

532
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,808
"Killing me softly"

533
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,227
Come sing with us, Will.

534
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,272
I should really get going. Thanks.

535
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,734
That's the problem with charity.
You must mean it.

536
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,570
You have to mean things to help people.

537
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:33,407
Like the time I volunteered
to help out at a soup kitchen...

538
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,868
and very nearly made it.

539
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:37,995
Or the time at Amnesty International.

540
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:41,957
Did you know in Burma you get seven years
in prison for telling jokes?

541
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,586
Next time you laugh, think of Pa Pa Lay,
the Burmese standup comedian.

542
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:48,714
We're at a crucial stage
in our struggle for human rights...

543
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:51,633
which have been grossly abused
by the ruling junta.

544
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,302
We need your support more than ever.

545
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,304
Together we can make a difference....

546
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:58,682
You're kidding.
And what's your boyfriend say about that?

547
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,227
Wait a minute.
You say you haven't got a boyfriend?

548
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,897
Talk about human rights violations.

549
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:12,696
Is that right? You're in the bath now?

550
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,200
You have to mean things to help people.

551
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,035
Fiona meant Killing Me Softly.

552
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:22,706
Killing Me Softly meant something to her
and look where she ended up.

553
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,754
Me, I didn't mean anything, about anything,
to anyone.

554
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,716
I knew that guaranteed me
a long, depression-free life.

555
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:05,415
Yet over the next few days,
I did have a strange feeling.

556
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:08,126
Like a presence lurking
at the back of my mind.

557
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,003
And I didn't like it.

558
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,811
You don't have a kid, do you?

559
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,021
What?

560
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,399
You don't have a kid, do you?

561
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,526
Of course I do! What are you on about?

562
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:33,694
No, you don't.

563
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:37,030
I've been watching you,
and you don't have a kid.

564
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:41,493
What is it to you, anyway?
Nothing.

565
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:45,914
Except you've been lying to me,
my mum and my mum's friend.

566
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,166
- Can I come in?
- No.

567
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,376
Why?

568
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,460
'Cause I'm busy.

569
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:54,840
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching TV.

570
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:58,135
I could watch it with you, if you like.

571
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,595
That's very nice of you...

572
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,930
but I usually manage on my own, thanks.

573
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,144
Don't you have homework
to do, or something?

574
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,188
- Want to help?
- No, that's not what I meant.

575
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,481
I meant, why don't you go home
and do your homework?

576
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,150
I'll do you a deal.

577
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:17,487
I won't tell anyone you don't have a kid
if you go out with my mum.

578
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,161
You'd want your mum
to go out with someone like me?

579
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,704
You're not too bad.

580
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,999
I mean, you told lies,
but apart from that you seem okay.

581
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,544
And she's sad. I think
she'd like a boyfriend.

582
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,881
I can't just go out with someone...

583
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:39,343
because you want me to.
I'd have to like the person, as well.

584
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,138
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her, it's just the system.

585
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,099
That's how it....
I'm not talking about this with you.

586
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:47,476
Just go.

587
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,478
Okay. But I'll be back.

588
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,563
I'm really scared!

589
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,944
That's the best I could come up with,
"I'm scared."

590
00:37:57,194 --> 00:38:00,280
But as a matter of fact, I was.

591
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,098
Okay, that's it. Tim, goodbye.

592
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:10,517
- Jill, goodbye. Carol, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

593
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,479
And from me, arrivederci. Bye-bye.

594
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,240
Thanks. See you.

595
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,842
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the game of Countdown.

596
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:47,095
You remember yesterday, Carol,
I revealed to a grateful nation...

597
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,014
that our guest, Tom O'Connell...

598
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:52,059
Yes.
He, like all of us, changes for each show.

599
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:53,519
But he is such a...

600
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:58,732
HOST 1: Is that right?
HOST 2: Yeah.

601
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,985
Another term for Hosta, I think.

602
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,320
Yes, well.

603
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:07,699
Named after Heinrich Christian Funck,
who also invented disco dancing.

604
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,996
Yes. I've got all his audios.

605
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:55,038
Mum, did you always know
I was going to be a vegetarian?

606
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:56,915
Yeah, of course I did.

607
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:00,627
I didn't decide on the spur of the moment
'cause we ran out of sausages.

608
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:03,088
Did you ask me if I wanted
to be a vegetarian?

609
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,048
What, when you were born?

610
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,467
I do the cooking and I
don't want to cook meat.

611
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:10,053
You have to eat what I eat.

612
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,974
But you don't let me go
to McDonald's, either.

613
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:17,060
Is this premature teenage rebellion?

614
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,022
I can't stop you from going to McDonald's.

615
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:22,733
I'd just be disappointed if you did.

616
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,947
Don't worry, Mum.
I won't go to McDonald's.

617
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:37,039
After a few visits, Will seemed to think
he had to ask me serious questions.

618
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:41,210
But I knew he really wanted to watch
Warrior Princess.

619
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,170
So, how's it going at home then?

620
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,923
- You mean my mum?
- Yeah.

621
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,383
She's all right, thanks.

622
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,097
I mean, you know, she's....

623
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:59,520
Yeah, I know. No, nothing like that.

624
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,484
Does it still bother you, then?

625
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,028
Does it bother me?

626
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,490
Are you decent?

627
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,704
Every single day.

628
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,374
That's why I come here,
instead of going home.

629
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,210
A bit. When I think about it.

630
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,506
Fucking hell.

631
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:34,638
I don't know why he swore like that,
but it made me feel better.

632
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:39,142
It made me feel like I wasn't
being pathetic to get so scared.

633
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,607
I wouldn't make the mistake of asking
about Fiona again.

634
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:47,484
Marcus was clearly screwed up about it...

635
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:51,488
and unfortunately I couldn't think
of anything to say that'd be of any value.

636
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:54,199
Next time he could talk to Suzie,
or a counselor...

637
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,411
or anybody capable
of something more than an obscenity.

638
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,705
Shit! It can't be.

639
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,127
November-the-sodding-19.

640
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,423
Six weeks before Christmas and already
they were playing the bloody thing.

641
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,216
Dad?

642
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:20,976
What was your dad like?

643
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,270
A bit sad, really.

644
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:27,441
You know, he wrote one crap song
that turned out to be a massive hit...

645
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:31,320
and then spent the rest of his life
trying to write a better one.

646
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,363
Do you ever want to write songs like him?

647
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,657
Is that what the guitar's for?

648
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,243
No.

649
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,122
So, that's just there to look cool.

650
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:43,707
Yeah.

651
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,713
I like Santa's Super Sleigh.

652
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,816
Madonna! Come here!
We've got something.

653
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,486
He's getting away, look!
Hurry up!

654
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:16,198
On Pet Rescue today,
the clever stoat keeps everyone...

655
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,575
on their toes in Somerset.

656
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,727
Hey!

657
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,896
What are you doing?
Who are you?

658
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,147
Who am I?

659
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:53,443
Bugger off, that's who I am!
Go on, piss off!

660
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,989
Who were they, then?

661
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,407
Who?

662
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,533
What do you mean, "Who?"

663
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:02,494
The ones
trying to embed sweets into your skull.

664
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:03,662
Oh, them.

665
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:07,666
They're just a couple of older kids.
They started following me after school.

666
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,418
Does this happen often?

667
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:12,212
They never chucked sweets before,
they just thought of that.

668
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:15,841
I'm not talking about the sweets.
The kids trying to kill you.

669
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,260
Yeah, they give me a hard time.

670
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:21,972
You know, about my hair,
and my clothes and singing and stuff.

671
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:23,557
And what? And singing?

672
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,811
Sometimes I sing out loud without noticing.

673
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,230
That's not a brilliant idea, is it?

674
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:34,359
I said I did it without noticing, didn't I?
It just happens!

675
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:38,488
I'm not going to do it on purpose, am I?
I'm not stupid, you know.

676
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:42,784
My advice is to keep out of people's way.
Try to make yourself invisible.

677
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,286
How can I be invisible?

678
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:46,663
One machine in your kitchen
is an invisible machine?

679
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:48,457
I don't think so.

680
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,545
I just try not to think of it, that's all.

681
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:58,217
It happens, and I wish it didn't,
but that's life, isn't it?

682
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,971
There's nothing I can do about it.

683
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,476
No.

684
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:12,481
There is something we can
do about it, Marcus.

685
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:14,816
You're coming with me.

686
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,487
I was worried he was going to take me
to the headmistress' office.

687
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,949
But instead he took me shopping.

688
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,242
I don't get it.

689
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,993
We're starting with your feet.

690
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:29,081
I can't make you invisible,
but I can make you blend in with the crowd.

691
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,377
I don't know how to tie them.
They've got these funny strappy things.

692
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,711
It's called Velcro.

693
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,214
It's a revolutionary new technology.

694
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:43,053
For Christ's sake. It's not hard.

695
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,349
All right, wait a minute, it is a bit hard.

696
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:50,394
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

697
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:54,606
Pretty trendy, your old man, isn't he?

698
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,153
There. You think you look cool, don't you?

699
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:01,405
Don't know.

700
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:05,450
- Do you think I look cool?
- Yeah, Marcus.

701
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:09,329
- I think you look cool.
- Yeah.

702
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:15,210
That's it, you got the walk.
That's really cool.

703
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:19,965
Brilliant. High five. Yeah.

704
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:23,552
I was suddenly hit by an extraordinary
rush of well-being.

705
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:26,471
So this is what people
meant by a natural high.

706
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,807
And it only cost60.

707
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:31,894
I had made an unhappy
boy temporarily happy.

708
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,229
And there wasn't anything
in it for me at all.

709
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,398
I didn't even want to shag his mum.

710
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,412
Marcus! What happened to your shoes?

711
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,331
They stole them.

712
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,426
Why would anyone want to steal your shoes?

713
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,762
I could see I had to tell the truth.

714
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,848
The problem was, the truth would
lead to a lot more questions.

715
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,517
They were nice ones.

716
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,977
They were just ordinary brown lace-ups.

717
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:17,231
No, they weren't. They
were cool new trainers.

718
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:19,733
Where did you get cool new trainers?

719
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,568
She had loads more questions.

720
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:23,445
Will bought them for me.

721
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,114
Will?

722
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:29,952
- The guy who took us to lunch?
- Yeah.

723
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,287
He's sort of become my friend.

724
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:34,540
He's sort of become your friend?

725
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:37,125
She kept repeating
the last thing I said.

726
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,877
Except she shouted it.

727
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:41,463
I go round to his place after school.

728
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:44,216
You go round to his place after school!

729
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:48,095
- You see, he doesn't really have a kid.
- He doesn't really have a kid?

730
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:50,305
Can I play computer games now?

731
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:51,598
Where does he live?

732
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:54,518
He's not there at the moment.
He's out to dinner.

733
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:59,606
Christine had asked me to dinner
for a pep talk.

734
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:03,110
You will end up childless and alone.

735
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:05,237
Both fingers crossed, yeah.

736
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:08,657
You must have a lot of courage.

737
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,742
Why is that, Christine?

738
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,872
Most people need something in their lives
to keep them afloat...

739
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:17,958
and you have absolutely nothing.

740
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,669
Doesn't that scare you?

741
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:23,338
Do you know what you want?

742
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,508
Yes, I do. I'll have the steak...

743
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:30,137
What the hell are these little
after-school tea parties about?

744
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,598
Hi. Sorry? What did you say?

745
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:36,810
I was just wondering why a single,
childless man would want to hang out...

746
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:39,354
with a 12-year-old boy every day?

747
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:42,524
You didn't tell your mum
that you've been coming round?

748
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:45,027
- I think I forgot.
- Tell me what?

749
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,487
What are you doing with my son?

750
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,948
Wait a minute. What are
you suggesting here?

751
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:52,284
- I'm not suggesting anything.
- I think you are.

752
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:55,954
You were suggesting that
I've been interfering with your son.

753
00:49:56,038 --> 00:50:00,501
I'm simply asking you why you
entertain 12-year-olds in your flat.

754
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:03,086
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

755
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:07,007
What do you have to say for yourself?

756
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:08,800
Well?

757
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:10,636
Don't "well" me!

758
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,346
Don't "well" me about this!

759
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,140
He comes over uninvited every night!
Do you know why?

760
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:19,061
He's having the shit bullied out of him at school!
And you haven't got a clue.

761
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,230
You send him out like a
lamb to the slaughter!

762
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:24,900
He's been taken to pieces every day of
the week, you daft, fucking hippie!

763
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,694
I think you're being a bit melodramatic.
Marcus is fine.

764
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:31,907
Strange. Will had it right, Mum didn't.
It should be the other way around.

765
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,909
You haven't had much contact with kids.

766
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,745
I used to be a bloody kid!
I went to a bloody school.

767
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:40,290
I know when kids can't settle down
and when kids are miserable!

768
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:44,002
Look at him, for Christ's sake!
Don't accuse me of being melodramatic.

769
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:47,589
- This coming from a woman who tried to...
- Cowabunga!

770
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,510
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

771
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,303
I just felt like a shout.

772
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:54,638
Jesus, what a family.

773
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:58,267
Will, you're disturbing
the other customers.

774
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,935
It's fine. I'm sorry. I'm done.

775
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:02,604
- Okay, so, you're not....
- What?

776
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,607
No, I'm not! No, I'm not.

777
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:07,943
Listen, don't worry about it.

778
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,237
I won't open the door
to Marcus again, okay?

779
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,698
I'll be glad to be rid of
the pair of you, frankly.

780
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:14,533
Go on. Bugger off.

781
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,120
Sorry.

782
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:28,964
So that's it, is it?

783
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:31,842
You're just out of his life, like that.

784
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:32,843
Excuse me?

785
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:35,179
Let's say you're right and I'm wrong.

786
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,181
Let's say there's this whole world...

787
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:40,767
that I don't understand,
and somehow, miraculously, you do.

788
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,978
What are you going to do about it?

789
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:46,023
I'm not going to do anything.
He's none of my business.

790
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:48,817
- You're a selfish bastard.
- That's what I tell him.

791
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:52,529
- He always puts himself first.
- But I'm on my own.

792
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:53,906
It's just me.

793
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:56,742
I'm not putting myself first.
There's nobody else.

794
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:57,826
Yes, there is!

795
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,370
There's Marcus. You're involved now.

796
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,664
He keeps coming around your bloody house.

797
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:05,209
You've come into his life for a reason.

798
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,919
You can't just shut him out.

799
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:10,130
You can't shut life out.
"No man is an island."

800
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,174
- She's right, you know.
- Yeah, she is.

801
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,759
No, she's not! She's wrong!

802
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,761
Some men are islands. I'm a bloody island!

803
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,262
I'm bloody lbiza!

804
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,724
What are you talking about?

805
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,894
Do you want to come over for Christmas?

806
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:29,775
No, Marcus, I do not want
to come over for bloody Christmas.

807
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:34,196
I do not want to spend Christmas
with Miss Granola Suicide and her spawn.

808
00:52:35,864 --> 00:52:38,116
I'd always thought
what you did with Christmas...

809
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,537
was sort of a statement about
where you stood in life.

810
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,415
I was going to spend this Christmas
the way I usually did.

811
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,752
Watching videos and
getting drunk and stoned.

812
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:04,810
Before you came,
I was all alone.

813
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,145
It is bad to be alone.

814
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:10,649
Alone, bad.

815
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,402
Friend, good.

816
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:17,281
Friend, goodl

817
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,617
Now come here.

818
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:24,204
The good news was it wasn't
just me and Fiona and Marcus.

819
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:27,040
The bad news was, well....

820
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:31,044
So, you're Marcus' dad.

821
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:37,050
Yeah, I guess so.
And this is my girlfriend, Lindsey.

822
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,347
And Lindsey's mum.

823
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:47,019
Hi there.

824
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,739
- Thanks, Dad.
- That's okay.

825
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,866
I had to hand it to the kid.

826
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:04,369
He could be enthusiastic
about some truly crap present.

827
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,414
Wow, a tambourine! Thanks, Mum.

828
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,499
Isn't that cool, Will?

829
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:12,211
Yeah, that'll come in handy.

830
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:14,421
I saw it and I thought,
"This'll be perfect."

831
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:19,384
Maybe you can perform at that school concert.
Get a pop group together. Make some friends.

832
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:21,386
Maybe, Mum.

833
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,392
When you sing, it brings sunshine
and happiness into my heart.

834
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:29,978
Thanks, Mum.

835
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,611
This one's from me.

836
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:48,121
Brilliant! What is it?

837
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,873
It's a CD, Marcus.

838
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:53,126
By Mystikal. They're cool.
You'll like them.

839
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,462
And what kind of music is Mystikal?

840
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:58,674
It's sort of world music.

841
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:00,968
"Shake Ya Ass."

842
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:03,178
Slash rap type thing.

843
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:05,973
Shake Ya Ass?

844
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:07,391
Is he Moroccan?

845
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,434
I'm afraid we haven't got a CD player.

846
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:10,519
It's great anyway.

847
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:15,065
I know you haven't got a CD player,
so, I got you one of them as well.

848
00:55:15,357 --> 00:55:17,317
What a lucky boy.

849
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,945
Look, Mum.

850
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:23,115
- Open yours, Will.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

851
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,914
- Marcus, is this a joke?
- Yeah.

852
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,834
It's not bad.

853
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:37,212
Hi. Sorry, I'm dead late!

854
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,464
- Have I missed anything?
- No, come on in.

855
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:42,134
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

856
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:44,344
Hey!

857
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:47,431
Long time no see.

858
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,225
Where's Megan?

859
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:54,730
At her dad's. Where's Ned?
At his mum's for Christmas?

860
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,863
Yeah.

861
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:06,241
No. I should probably go, shouldn't I?

862
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:10,495
You could go pose as Santa,
try and shag some carol singers.

863
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,539
Are you a professional Santa?

864
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,874
How lovely!

865
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:16,418
Right. That's it. I'm off.

866
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:18,295
Thank you very much. It was great.

867
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:21,048
Suzie has every right to express her anger.

868
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,758
Yes, and she's expressed it.

869
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:25,135
Now I have a right to bugger off.

870
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,304
Thanks a lot. 'Bye.

871
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,555
Wait!

872
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:30,891
He's my friend. I invited him.

873
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:32,976
I should be able to tell
him when to go home.

874
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,437
I haven't told Will to go, Marcus.

875
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:38,774
Suzie's angry and has every right to be,
and she's telling him so.

876
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:39,983
She's right, Marcus.

877
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,902
Just leave it, okay?

878
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,947
All he did was make up a
kid for a couple weeks.

879
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:47,574
God, that's nothing. So what? Who cares?

880
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,701
Kids at school do worse
than that every day!

881
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,704
The point is, Marcus,
Will left school a long time ago.

882
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:55,040
He should've grown out
of making people up by now.

883
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:57,459
- That's for sure.
- Lt's not fair to gang up on him.

884
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:59,253
He's been better behaved since then.

885
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:04,675
He bought me trainers, he lets me go round
to his house and he knows what kids need.

886
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,803
What?
Expensive footwear and obscene music?

887
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:10,973
If there's something you really need
then we can talk about it.

888
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:14,685
No, we can't. It's not a discussion,
it's an argument, and you always win.

889
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,729
- Why not just tell me what to do?
- I want you to think for yourself!

890
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:20,357
I'm thinking for myself!
And I want Will to stay!

891
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,943
He's not the only one
who ever did anything wrong!

892
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:25,237
Remember how we met? Remember why?
Because you...

893
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,950
Because you threw a loaf of bread
at a duck's head and killed it, basically.

894
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:36,707
Excuse me? What's this about a duck?

895
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,251
Are we having duck? Delicious!

896
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,922
Of course we were not having duck.

897
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:46,967
Instead we had nut loaf with parsnip gravy.

898
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,555
As I sat there, I had a strange feeling.

899
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,183
I was enjoying myself.

900
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:57,477
I'd never really enjoyed Christmas before.

901
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,938
My mother used to make me sing
Santa's Super Sleigh...

902
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:02,482
in front of my inebriated
uncles and aunts...

903
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:04,985
just to get at my dad, I think.

904
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,031
But Christmas at Marcus',
I'm ashamed to say it, gave me...

905
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:10,866
a warm, fuzzy feeling.

906
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:14,828
I held that feeling responsible
for the strange events that followed.

907
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:21,418
First of all, Marcus got a crush on a girl.

908
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,587
Hello.
Piss off.

909
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:29,510
And then, even stranger, so did I.

910
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,221
It was all Marcus' fault, really...

911
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:36,600
because once you open your door
to one person, anyone can come in.

912
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:39,478
On New Year's Eve, I met Rachel.

913
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,272
She was interesting, smart and attractive.

914
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,984
And for about five minutes,
I had her convinced that I was, too.

915
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,195
Things like political events.

916
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,154
Okay.

917
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:50,697
You in television?

918
00:58:51,031 --> 00:58:54,409
Am I in television? No.

919
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:56,662
- Everyone else is in television.
- Yeah.

920
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,913
I watch television.

921
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:01,083
Right, right.
So you're more in front of it than in it.

922
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,126
- ln it, yeah.
- Yes, I get it, yeah.

923
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,461
It was torture.

924
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:08,966
For five minutes I realized what life would
be like if I were, in any way, interesting.

925
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,594
If I had anything to say for myself,
if I did anything.

926
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,429
But I didn't do anything.

927
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:19,142
And in about 30 seconds she'd know
and she'd be gone like a shot.

928
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:21,812
So what do you do?

929
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:27,568
I'm sort of taking a bit
of time off at the moment.

930
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,070
- Sounds good, yeah.
- Yeah.

931
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:32,698
Time off from what?

932
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:39,496
To be absolutely honest,
time off from time off, in fact.

933
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:44,543
The interesting thing about me is
I don't actually do anything.

934
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,716
- You don't do anything?
- Actually, no.

935
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:55,762
- Nothing.
- Nope.

936
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:57,514
Wow.

937
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:00,017
That's....

938
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,187
Now, Rachel, darling.

939
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:07,608
East Coast or West Coast rap?

940
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:08,984
I have absolutely no....

941
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:13,280
There. She was gone.
There was no more to say.

942
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:16,533
All rap music sounds
exactly the same to me.

943
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:17,576
Or was there?

944
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:21,455
I tell you what. I know a 12-year-old
who'd kill you for saying that.

945
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,290
- Really?
- Yes.

946
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:26,043
- So do l, come to that.
- Yeah?

947
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:29,129
- Yeah. What's yours called?
- Mine?

948
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:34,301
He's called Marcus.

949
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:37,888
Mine's Ali. Alistair.

950
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,015
And there it was.

951
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:43,143
It wasn't a lie.
It was 100 percent her assumption.

952
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,938
Well, 50 percent, at the very least.

953
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:52,694
I was in fantasyland again.
But this time it was different.

954
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:58,200
SPAT was for fun. This was serious.
I acted in self-defense.

955
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,669
We arranged to get our lads together.

956
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:11,755
Which means
we arranged for us to get together.

957
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,591
Single parents, alone together.

958
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:18,178
Happy New Year!

959
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:21,181
I was in deep trouble.

960
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,811
And there was only one person
who could help me out.

961
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:40,450
"Shake ya ass, but watch ya self
Shake ya ass, show me what you workin' with

962
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:42,452
"Shake ya ass, watch ya self

963
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,584
- "Show me what you workin' with"
- What did you just say to me?

964
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,838
You heard me, squitty little shitty
snot-nosed bastard!

965
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,006
Sorry.

966
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:56,592
I was singing along to
this song by Mystikal.

967
01:01:56,758 --> 01:01:58,135
It's a rap.

968
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,761
You like rap?

969
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:00,846
A little.

970
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:04,183
It's by black people, mostly.
They're angry most of the time.

971
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,727
But sometimes they just want to have sex.

972
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:09,104
You taking a piss?

973
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:10,939
'Cause if you are, you'll get a slap.

974
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,524
I'm not taking a piss.

975
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:15,402
I don't even know how to take a piss.

976
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,946
- What's your name?
- Marcus.

977
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:21,825
I'm Ellie.

978
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:23,785
Hi, Ellie. Nice to meet you.

979
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:28,373
Not so fast. I'm not ready for physical contact.
Next thing you know, we'll be having sex.

980
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:30,417
And where will that get us?

981
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:33,754
And stop telling strangers
to shake their ass.

982
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,590
Okay, Ellie. See you!

983
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:48,894
Hello, mate.

984
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,564
Listen, I need your help.

985
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:57,236
Why did you tell this lady I was your son?

986
01:02:57,319 --> 01:02:58,570
No, I didn't tell her.

987
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:01,615
I told you,
she just got the wrong end of the stick.

988
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,033
So just tell her.

989
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:05,202
- No. Can't do that.
- Why not?

990
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:09,623
We're really going around in circles here.
Just accept the facts, okay?

991
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:11,333
You're my son.

992
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,377
I'll tell her, if you like. I don't mind.

993
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,838
That's very kind of you, Marcus, but no.

994
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:18,215
- Why not?
- For Christ's sake!

995
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:21,969
She's got a rare disease and if she
believes something that's not right...

996
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:26,473
then hears the truth, her brain will
boil in her head and she'll die, okay?

997
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,934
That's a load of shit.

998
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:33,522
I'm really interested in this woman.

999
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:36,066
What do you mean, interested?

1000
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:38,318
What's so interesting about her?

1001
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:40,195
Okay, Marcus, here.

1002
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:43,407
Here's my last scrap of dignity. Enjoy it.

1003
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:46,201
I want to go out with her. Okay?

1004
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:48,704
I'd like her to be my girlfriend.
There, I said it.

1005
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:51,415
Brilliant! Why didn't you just say that?

1006
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:53,750
I don't know.

1007
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:57,296
I was embarrassed or something,
'cause this is a bit new for me.

1008
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,965
I just met her, her name's Rachel.
She's sort of...

1009
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,842
There's this girl at school. Ellie.

1010
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,802
I kind of want her to be my girlfriend.

1011
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,679
I'm not exactly sure.

1012
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,514
I've been meaning to ask you.

1013
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:11,602
What's the difference between
a girl who's your friend and a girlfriend?

1014
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:15,189
Well, I don't know.

1015
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:17,983
Do you want to touch her?

1016
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:19,318
Is that so important?

1017
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:21,069
Yeah, you've heard about sex, right?

1018
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:22,779
It is kind of a big deal.

1019
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:24,907
I know. I'm not stupid.

1020
01:04:25,574 --> 01:04:28,035
I just can't believe there's
nothing more to it.

1021
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:32,289
I mean, like, I want to be with her more.
I want to be with her all the time.

1022
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:35,250
And I want to tell her things
I don't even tell you or Mum.

1023
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,836
And I don't want her to
have another boyfriend.

1024
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,963
If I could have all those things...

1025
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,383
I wouldn't really mind
if I touched her or not.

1026
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,261
Well, you'll learn, Marcus.

1027
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:48,805
You won't feel like that forever.

1028
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:54,728
Okay, how do I look?

1029
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:56,647
Good. How do I look?

1030
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:01,860
Just be as normal as you can, okay?

1031
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,571
Good advice for Marcus.

1032
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:06,365
I wish I could have followed it.

1033
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,200
I'm sorry it's such a mess.

1034
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:10,327
That's where I work.

1035
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,706
My mouth was dry
and my palms sweating.

1036
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,292
I didn't know what the
hell was happening to me.

1037
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:20,170
Manage to tidy up. Ali?

1038
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:23,173
All I could do was stand there,
grinning like an idiot.

1039
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:26,134
- Should we just go upstairs?
- Sure. Okay.

1040
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:30,013
Ali.

1041
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,390
Marcus.

1042
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:33,392
Marcus.

1043
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:35,269
Ali.

1044
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:39,189
You're in my year at school.

1045
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:42,234
Really? Yeah, I think I've seen you around.

1046
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:43,193
Great!

1047
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:45,529
Then you guys'll have a lot to talk about.

1048
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,447
Will, this is Ali.

1049
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,366
Ali, this is Will.

1050
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,160
- All right.
- All right.

1051
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:57,082
Do you guys want to hang
up here for a while?

1052
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:00,169
- Yeah, sounds good, right?
- Yeah. Okay.

1053
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:02,129
For a moment, I loved him.

1054
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:03,672
Really loved him.

1055
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,008
You can show him
your new computer games.

1056
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:08,010
Good. Okay, catch you later.

1057
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:10,137
Let's leave them to it.

1058
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:22,274
If your dad goes out with my mum,
then you're dead.

1059
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,817
Really dead.

1060
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,446
- Don't worry. He's all right.
- I don't care if he's all right!

1061
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:29,448
I don't want him going out with my mum!

1062
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:33,285
I don't want to see him
or you around here ever again, okay?

1063
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:35,245
I'm not really sure it's up to me.

1064
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:38,415
Well, it better be! Or you're going to die.

1065
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:42,419
I was getting the feeling that maybe
this kid Ali was a serial killer.

1066
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:45,589
Can I have a go on your computer?
What games you got?

1067
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:47,466
Are you listening to me?

1068
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:51,178
Yeah, it's just that I can't really
do much at the moment, can I?

1069
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:54,473
I mean, Will, that's my dad...

1070
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:58,519
he likes your mum,
and I think she's keen on him.

1071
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:00,229
She's not keen on him!

1072
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,231
She's only keen on me!

1073
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:06,109
One amazing thing about Rachel...

1074
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:09,988
was that I wanted to kiss her every time
she said something interesting.

1075
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,199
Which was all the time.

1076
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,369
It was sexy. It was weird.

1077
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:19,998
RACHEL: I use Bristol
boards, India ink and....

1078
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,668
Am I boring you?

1079
01:07:22,918 --> 01:07:24,378
No, no. No.

1080
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:27,798
- What?
- Nothing.

1081
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:30,759
It's just you looked like Marcus just then.

1082
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:32,678
Did I?

1083
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:36,223
I think it's sweet how much
he seems to take after you...

1084
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:39,560
and the way he dresses
like you, as well.

1085
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:43,814
I don't think I dress like Marcus, really.

1086
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,485
Marcus?

1087
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:55,409
Wait! Hang on. Hang on.
Come on, we're going back.

1088
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:58,036
- He's off his head.
- No, he's not.

1089
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:02,374
He said he'd cut me up into little pieces
and hide me under the floorboards.

1090
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:05,419
- He did?
- No.

1091
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:07,379
But I'm sure he's capable of it.

1092
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:09,506
It'll be different. You'll
like it, I promise.

1093
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,801
Marcus, Ali has something to say to you.

1094
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,638
Doesn't he?

1095
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,516
Sorry, Marcus.

1096
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:23,145
I didn't mean to say those things.

1097
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,063
It's okay, Ali.

1098
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:29,443
Ali finds all this very difficult.

1099
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,945
Yeah, so does Marcus.

1100
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:35,657
Don't you, mate?

1101
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:38,327
You know, I mean, divorced parents...

1102
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:41,663
and not knowing
how to feel about new people.

1103
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:46,919
Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely the way I feel.

1104
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:50,005
Ali didn't get along
with the last bloke I went out with.

1105
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:52,341
- He was a liar!
- All right, darling.

1106
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:55,427
He wasn't 100 percent good news.

1107
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:59,806
- I'm not saying that you and I are.
- That's okay.

1108
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:02,476
He fancies you. He told me.

1109
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:08,232
- Thanks a lot, mate.
- Oh, dear.

1110
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:09,816
Cheers, mate.

1111
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,864
Don't look so worried, sweetheart.

1112
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:18,617
Ellie!

1113
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,203
- Marcus? What, are you stalking me?
- No.

1114
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:23,455
Too bad. Made me feel like a celebrity.

1115
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,792
Yeah, but I didn't know
that then, did l, sexy?

1116
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,796
All I'm saying is, you know, watch out.

1117
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:34,925
It just looks a bit more like owner and pet
than boyfriend and girlfriend.

1118
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,802
At least I'm honest.

1119
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:38,011
What does that mean?

1120
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:40,430
It's just that you and Rachel....

1121
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:44,226
What? What does that mean?

1122
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:47,771
I don't know, I think there's a
problem with you and Rachel.

1123
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:51,692
I mean, like, you want to be with her
but she thinks you have a son.

1124
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,943
And you don't.

1125
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:55,070
If you're going to be with someone...

1126
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:57,781
shouldn't you tell
them things like that?

1127
01:09:58,574 --> 01:09:59,616
No.

1128
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,452
I mean, you know, like the truth.

1129
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,831
What's wrong with you?

1130
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:09,668
But later that night,
when I was on my own...

1131
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:13,088
I remembered the deal
Marcus was prepared to strike.

1132
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:16,675
Yes, I wanted to touch Rachel.

1133
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:20,179
But at this moment, if I had the choice...

1134
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:23,974
I'd settle for the less and the more
that Marcus wanted.

1135
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:26,977
Jesus, was I turning into Marcus?

1136
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,563
Would he be buying me shoes soon?

1137
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:34,067
I took his advice and
told Rachel the truth.

1138
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,196
Or very nearly the truth.

1139
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:40,115
That I wasn't Marcus' natural father.

1140
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:43,035
And that is not natural seaweed.

1141
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:47,080
The problem was, once I told the truth,
I knew there'd be more questions.

1142
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:49,791
I don't get it. If you're
not his natural father...

1143
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:54,046
and you don't live with him,
then how is he your son?

1144
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,589
Yeah, I see.

1145
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:59,176
It must look very confusing
from the outside.

1146
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,678
Tell me how it is on the inside.

1147
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:05,015
It's just one of those
long, boring stories.

1148
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:07,518
Look, do you want to move on to wine?

1149
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:09,603
You want some Chinese rice wine, miss?

1150
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:14,858
You would like to try,
I suspect, the Panang Paneng.

1151
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:17,027
Yeah?

1152
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:18,779
No.

1153
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,866
Tell me about your relationship with Ali.

1154
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,662
- ls that as complicated as mine and Marcus'?
- No.

1155
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:30,457
I slept with his father,
and then nine months later I gave birth.

1156
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:31,583
Pretty straight forward.

1157
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:34,086
Yeah. I envy you that.

1158
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:39,633
I'm really sorry to harp on about this
but I haven't got it all worked out yet.

1159
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:44,096
You are Marcus' stepfather, but you
don't live with him or with his mother.

1160
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:49,184
No, you see, wait.

1161
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:03,407
I never said he was my son.

1162
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:04,575
Did I?

1163
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:07,911
The words "I have a son called Marcus,"
never escaped my lips.

1164
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:10,247
It's what you chose to believe.

1165
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,124
Yeah. Right.

1166
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:14,668
It's me that's the fantasist.

1167
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:18,630
I wanted to believe that you had a son,
so I let my imagination run riot.

1168
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:20,883
Obviously I played a part, I can see that.

1169
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:24,761
No! Not at all.
I met you and I thought, "Cute guy.

1170
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:28,140
"God, if only he had a son.
A geeky, teenage kid, if possible."

1171
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:31,101
Then you turned up at my house
with Marcus, and bingo!

1172
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:35,731
Now I made this crazy link 'cause of
some deep psychological need in me.

1173
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,318
You shouldn't beat yourself up about it.

1174
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:42,738
It could have happened to anyone.

1175
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:51,205
The first time I met you
I thought you were a bit blank.

1176
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:56,001
But then you changed my mind.

1177
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,379
Maybe I was right.

1178
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,757
- Rachel, listen.
- Yes?

1179
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:14,520
I'm sorry, you're right.

1180
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:22,569
I am a blank.

1181
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:28,158
I'm really nothing.

1182
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:36,250
I don't know what the hell I
was thinking of, I'm sorry.

1183
01:13:57,437 --> 01:13:58,438
'Bye, Ellie.

1184
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:00,232
Marcus! My man!

1185
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,401
Bye, Marcus!

1186
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,152
See you, Marcus!

1187
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:24,548
Mum?

1188
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:54,828
So, if z = 17, does x > 2?

1189
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:56,580
Marcus?

1190
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:00,334
I didn't know what the answer was.

1191
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,586
I didn't know what "x" equaled.

1192
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:05,005
And I didn't know how to help my mum.

1193
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:16,725
And then I realized.

1194
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:19,645
There was something she said
I could do for her.

1195
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:24,525
- I'm thinking of singing at the school concert.
- You? At the rock concert?

1196
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:28,695
I don't think that would be
a very good idea, Marcus.

1197
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,155
Will you accompany me?

1198
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,199
All I've got is a tambourine.

1199
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:36,161
No, I'm sorry. It's suicide.

1200
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:40,207
I mean, they'll crucify you.

1201
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:06,817
Mum's at it again.

1202
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:13,073
- At what? Sorry.
- What do you mean, what?

1203
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,367
The crying.

1204
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,995
She sits in the house all day, crying.

1205
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,581
She does it in the mornings, too.

1206
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:28,172
It's as bad now as it was
before the Dead Duck Day.

1207
01:16:33,886 --> 01:16:36,763
Marcus, I'm sorry, mate...

1208
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:40,934
l'm a bit busy at the moment.

1209
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:44,062
You're busy? Doing what?

1210
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,942
- Didn't you hear me?
- I heard you.

1211
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:52,404
- What do you want me to do about it?
- I don't know.

1212
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:55,073
- You could talk to her.
- Yeah? And what would I say?

1213
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,326
- I don't know!
- Why would she listen to me?

1214
01:16:57,409 --> 01:16:59,077
Who am I to her?

1215
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,580
- I'm nobody.
- You're not nobody.

1216
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:03,999
- You're...
- Who? Who do you think I am?

1217
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,502
Who do you think you are?

1218
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:10,547
You come here uninvited,
you disrupt my life, you screw things up.

1219
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:13,675
What do you want from me?
This isn't my problem.

1220
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:16,595
I'm not your family, mate. I'm not.
I'm not your uncle.

1221
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:17,930
I'm not your big brother.

1222
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:21,475
We've established pretty firmly
that I'm not your father, either, am I?

1223
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:22,434
But....

1224
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:23,852
I'll tell you what I am.

1225
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:28,398
I'm the guy who's really good at
choosing trainers or records, okay?

1226
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:31,109
That's it. I can't help
you with real things.

1227
01:17:31,276 --> 01:17:34,696
I can't help you with anything
that means anything.

1228
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:38,784
You could try.

1229
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:49,586
You're right.

1230
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:51,797
You can't help me.

1231
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:53,298
How could you?

1232
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,093
You're a stupid person who
watches TV all day...

1233
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:57,177
and buys things.

1234
01:17:57,261 --> 01:18:01,765
You don't give a shit about anybody,
and nobody gives a shit about you!

1235
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:35,591
Mum said my singing brought
sunshine and happiness...

1236
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:37,092
into her life.

1237
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:40,596
So I'd do it, even if
it meant mine was over.

1238
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:11,585
Look, Mum.

1239
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:59,466
My life is made up of units of time.
Buying CDs: Two units.

1240
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:03,804
Eating lunch: Three units.

1241
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:09,268
Exercising: Two units.

1242
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:14,356
All in all, I had a very full life.

1243
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:28,328
It's just that it didn't mean anything.

1244
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:47,097
"Look who's coming
round the bend"

1245
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:59,443
The fact was there was only one thing
that meant something to me:

1246
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:15,250
Marcus. He was the only thing
that meant something to me.

1247
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,754
And Fiona was the only thing
that meant something to him.

1248
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:21,256
And she was about to fall off the edge.

1249
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:42,194
Single parents alone together!

1250
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:44,279
Single parents alone together!

1251
01:21:44,363 --> 01:21:48,742
Single parents alone together!
All for one and one for all!

1252
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:54,248
- Fiona!
- Will, we haven't seen you for a while.

1253
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:55,749
How's Ned?

1254
01:21:56,291 --> 01:22:00,671
Who? He's a load of crap. He doesn't exist.

1255
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:03,298
Yeah, I made him up.

1256
01:22:03,382 --> 01:22:04,800
- You made him up?
- Yeah.

1257
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:07,427
- To meet women.
- You're sick.

1258
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,681
- Fiona, I've got to talk to you.
- Go ahead.

1259
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:13,600
No, you know, properly
talk to you, privately.

1260
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:16,770
No, this is a circle of truth.

1261
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:20,440
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it in front of everybody.

1262
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:25,779
Okay. Please don't try
and commit suicide again.

1263
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:31,702
I can't believe you just said that.
That is my private experience.

1264
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:34,538
Yeah, well, that's the thing, isn't it?
It's not.

1265
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:36,206
Marcus is worried about you.

1266
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,375
I'm worried because he's worried about you.

1267
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:41,587
Will, I don't have plans to commit suicide.

1268
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:42,671
You don't?

1269
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:44,423
Not at the moment, no.

1270
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,593
Great. Great!

1271
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:49,803
Good.

1272
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:52,764
You know I'm not attracted to you, right?

1273
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:57,853
What are you on about?
No. What are you, nuts?

1274
01:22:58,604 --> 01:23:00,814
Right. Wrong word completely.

1275
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:06,069
But that's something that
we should, you know, talk about a bit.

1276
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,488
The crying in the morning
thing, the depression.

1277
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:10,908
Let's get that fixed.

1278
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:14,077
That's what men think, isn't it?
What?

1279
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:17,748
That unless you've got the answer,
unless you can say:

1280
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:21,960
"I know a bloke in the Essex Road who can
fix that," then there's no point bothering.

1281
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:23,045
No.

1282
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:26,298
Well, yeah, okay. I would.

1283
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,426
I'd love to know the name of the bloke
in the Essex Road...

1284
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:31,762
because I've got a
feeling I'd be useless.

1285
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:33,889
Will, you're not useless.

1286
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:38,602
You're here. And that matters.

1287
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:40,812
Right.

1288
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:43,273
- Now, can we.... Do you mind?
- What?

1289
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:47,069
- Marcus is singing at the school concert.
- Marcus is singing?

1290
01:23:47,236 --> 01:23:48,612
- Yeah, singing.
- At school?

1291
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:50,322
It's a pop concert. He's so excited.

1292
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:53,617
- I want to get there on time.
- Wait, wait. What's he singing?

1293
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:58,121
"Killing me softly with his song

1294
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,958
"Telling my whole life"

1295
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:06,964
- What time does this thing start?
- What have you got against Marcus singing?

1296
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:11,510
You know the dream where you're at school
without your trousers on and everyone laughs?

1297
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:14,805
- What's the connection?
- That will be Marcus, but for real.

1298
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:17,599
If he sings that song in
front of those kids...

1299
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:19,977
you can just write him
off until university.

1300
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:23,272
If he reaches university,
'cause he's going to get torn to shreds.

1301
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,983
You cannot stop someone
from expressing themselves.

1302
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:29,945
He's not expressing himself!
He's expressing you, okay?

1303
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:32,489
Oh, God.

1304
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:37,160
What? Jesus Christ.

1305
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:41,123
You're right. Will, am I a bad mother?

1306
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,086
No, you're not a bad mother.
You're just a barking lunatic.

1307
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:47,963
No, I am. I am a bad mother.

1308
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:51,425
I've let things slide
and I haven't been noticing properly.

1309
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:54,011
He's a special, very special boy.

1310
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:56,597
And he's got a special
soul, and I've wounded it!

1311
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,558
Please, just shut up.
You're wounding my soul.

1312
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:30,088
Okay, you park it.
What?

1313
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:19,137
Hi.

1314
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:21,807
What are you doing here?

1315
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,725
That's Ali up there.

1316
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:33,402
He's talented.

1317
01:26:58,135 --> 01:27:03,307
Now that was the Def Penalty Kru
with Murder Fo' Life.

1318
01:27:04,016 --> 01:27:07,060
Our next big act is Marcus Brewer...

1319
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:10,522
singing Roberta Flack's beloved
Killing Me Softly.

1320
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:16,737
He'll be accompanied by Simon Cosgrove
on the recorder.

1321
01:27:19,114 --> 01:27:20,699
Marcus, I can't do this.

1322
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:23,535
- That lot's going to shit all over us.
- But you said....

1323
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:27,289
I'm sorry. Here's your 5 back.

1324
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,210
Any moment now.

1325
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:48,060
Come on, Marcus, you wally!

1326
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:53,398
Wait! Wait!

1327
01:27:53,482 --> 01:27:55,901
Excuse me. What is going on here?

1328
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:59,696
Nothing. Everything's under control.
I'm just his voice coach.

1329
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:01,406
What are you doing here?

1330
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:05,953
I heard you were about to commit
social suicide, so I dropped by.

1331
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:07,746
- My accompanist left!
- Brilliant.

1332
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,706
- You don't have to do it.
- I can't do that.

1333
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:12,668
Yeah, you can.
Just tell them: Artistic differences.

1334
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,337
You can't work without him.
He had a drug problem.

1335
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,714
My mum wants me to sing it.
It'll make her happy.

1336
01:28:17,798 --> 01:28:22,970
Look, mate, nothing you do
can make your mum happy, all right?

1337
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:27,182
Not in the long term.
She has to do that for herself.

1338
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:30,894
- Get over here right now!
- Just bugger off, will you!

1339
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:34,523
What I'm saying is, the important thing is
to make yourself feel happy.

1340
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:38,527
I've tried just making myself happy.
She's tried making herself happy.

1341
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:41,321
It doesn't work.
You need other people to make you happy.

1342
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:42,739
But that's just it.

1343
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:46,994
If other people can make you happy
then they can also make you unhappy.

1344
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:50,706
What, you think those people out there
are going to make you happy?

1345
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:52,666
Hang on. Wait. Marcus, don't.

1346
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:55,043
Marcus! Bollocks.

1347
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:14,313
Come on, Britney!

1348
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,648
Yeah, give us a song, then.

1349
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:25,574
This is for my mum.

1350
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:35,792
"I heard he sang a good song

1351
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:40,422
"I heard he had a style

1352
01:29:41,882 --> 01:29:45,719
"And so I came to see him

1353
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:49,556
"to listen for a while

1354
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:55,312
"And there he was this young boy

1355
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:59,858
"a stranger to my eyes"

1356
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:01,818
You're rubbish, mate!

1357
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:12,287
"Strumming my pain with his fingers

1358
01:30:15,165 --> 01:30:19,336
"Singing my life with his words

01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:36,603
"Killing me softly with his song

1360
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,480
"Killing me softly"

1361
01:30:38,689 --> 01:30:41,066
Who the hell is that?

1362

"Telling my whole life with his words

1363

01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:15,058
"I prayed that he would finish

1368
01:31:15,559 --> 01:31:18,478

"Killing me softly"

01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:28,739
Give it a rest.

1373

"Killing me softly with his song

1374

01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:52,095

01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:53,096
Will.

1378
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:55,641
"In all my dark despair"

1379
01:31:55,724 --> 01:31:56,767
We're finished.

1380
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:01,647
"And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there"

1381
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,190
Will, come on.

1382
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:10,322
Will, we're finished.

1383
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:22,334
So there I was,
killing them softly with my song.

1384
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:25,796
Or rather, being killed.
And not that softly, either.

1385
01:32:26,046 --> 01:32:28,632
I was singing with my eyes closed.

1386
01:32:29,049 --> 01:32:30,425
Was I frightened?

1387
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:32,177
I was petrified.

1388
01:32:32,636 --> 01:32:34,555
This was definitely not island living.

1389
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:38,433
"Killing me softly

1390
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:42,229
"With his song"

1391
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,699
Thank you, Finsbury.

1392
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:57,828
I'd like to introduce
one or two members of the band.

1393
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:00,706
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.

1394
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:05,002
And that's about it.

1395
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:07,421
Let's get off quick. Get off.

1396
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:11,925
Marcus, thank you. For the song.

1397
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:13,510
You were terrific.

1398
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:15,095
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1399
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:19,099
As a matter of fact, I
think we should celebrate.

1400
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:20,350
Okay.

1401
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:24,563
How about McDonald's?

1402
01:33:24,897 --> 01:33:26,899
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.

1403
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:28,442
Thanks, Mum, but it's okay.

1404
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:31,111
No, really. I want to go to McDonald's.

1405
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:32,905
You know, I'm not really hungry.

1406
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:36,909
Come on. Are you telling me
you couldn't murder a Big Mac?

1407
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:38,118
Mum!

1408
01:33:39,828 --> 01:33:41,747
Okay, another time.

1409
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:45,667
Any time.

1410
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:51,006
I'll be around a while, you know.

1411
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:03,602
By the following Christmas
things were back to normal.

1412
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:06,104
Before you came...

1413
01:34:06,396 --> 01:34:09,733
Every man is an island.
And I stand by that.

1414
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:16,073
But clearly, some men are
part of island chains.

1415
01:34:17,241 --> 01:34:20,536
Below the surface of the ocean
they're actually connected.

1416
01:34:20,661 --> 01:34:23,372
So you're going to marry my mum, then?

1417
01:34:23,747 --> 01:34:24,873
Don't know.

1418
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:26,083
Why?

1419
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,960
You think she's up for it?

1420
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:30,587
- I used to want him to marry my mum.
- You serious?

1421
01:34:30,754 --> 01:34:34,091
Yeah. But that was when she was depressed
and I was desperate.

1422
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:36,051
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

1423
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:39,721
How do you use this blender-thing?
You don't.

1424
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:42,683
I used to think two wasn't enough.
Christ.

1425
01:34:42,766 --> 01:34:44,643
Now there were loads of people.

1426
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:47,020
And that was great. Mostly.

1427
01:34:48,856 --> 01:34:52,526
Are you two lazy bastards
gonna get up and help, or what?

1428
01:34:53,944 --> 01:34:56,864
So how do you know Will?

1429
01:34:56,947 --> 01:35:00,868
We volunteered together at Amnesty
International a couple years ago.

1430
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:04,329
Yeah, that's right.
How is the Burmese situation, Tom? Better?

1431
01:35:04,413 --> 01:35:05,831
I mean good?

1432
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:09,585
Yeah, and he called me up
out of the blue for Christmas lunch.

1433
01:35:09,668 --> 01:35:11,211
So, here I am.

1434
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,629
Really?

1435
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:23,265
So, listen, what's the deal
with you and Ellie now?

1436
01:35:23,348 --> 01:35:26,768
Is she your girlfriend?

1437
01:35:26,935 --> 01:35:28,687
Are you insane?

1438
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:33,192
Where did you get those trainers?

1439
01:35:33,275 --> 01:35:36,028
- Why? What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.

1440
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:37,362
What?

1441
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:40,866
By the way,
I do think you and Rachel have a shot.

1442
01:35:40,991 --> 01:35:44,077
- I mean, if you don't screw it up.
- Thank you.

1443
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:48,624
I'd created a monster.

1444
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,918
Or maybe he created me.

1445
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:56,632
I don't know
what Will was so upset about.

1446
01:35:57,341 --> 01:36:01,011
All I meant was
I don't think couples are the future.

1447
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:04,223
You need more than that. You need backup.

1448
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:08,060
The way I saw it,
Will and I both had backup now.

1449
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:13,607
It's like that thing he
told me Jon Bon Jovi said:

1450
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:15,609
"No man is an island."
