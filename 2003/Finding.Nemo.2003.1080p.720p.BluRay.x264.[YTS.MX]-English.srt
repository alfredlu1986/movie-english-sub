00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,763
-Wow.
-Mmm.

2
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,897
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,066
-Wow.
-Yes, Marlin.

4
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,201
No, l see it.
lt's beautiful.

5
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,769
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,977
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

7
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:55,818
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

8
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,789
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

9
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,122
-My man delivered.
-And it wasn't so easy.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,459
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

11
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,930
You better believe they did--
every single one of them.

12
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,990
Mm-hmm. You did good.

13
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,662
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,341
So, you do like it, don't you?

15
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,840
No, no. l do, l do.
l really do like it.

16
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,820
But, Marlin, l know that
the drop off is desirable...

17
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,119
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

18
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,926
but do we really need
so much space?

19
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,221
but do we really need
so much space?

20
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,057
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,257
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

22
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,528
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

23
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,434
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,629
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

25
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,968
Shh. You'll wake the kids.

26
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,802
Oh, right, right.

27
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:56,311
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

28
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,510
We still have to name them.

29
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,314
You want to name
all of them right now?

30
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,618
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

31
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,783
and this half Coral Junior.

32
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,385
-OK, we're done.
-l like Nemo.

33
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,192
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,791
but l'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

35
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,198
Just think,
in a couple of days...

36
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,727
-we're going to be parents.
-Yeah.

37
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,398
What if they don't like me?

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,964
-Marlin.
-No, really.

39
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:26,968
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,310
What?

41
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,980
-You remember how we met?
-l try not to.

42
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,488
Well, l remember.
''Excuse me, miss...

43
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,991
''can you check and see
if l have a hook in my lip?''

44
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,391
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

45
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,555
-Get away, get away!
-Here he is. Cutie's here.

46
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,525
Where did everybody go?

47
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,401
Coral, get inside the house.

48
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,345
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

49
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,975
Just get inside--
You, right now.

50
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,618
No! Ow!

51
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,555
Oh!

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,251
Ooh! Ooh!

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,402
Coral!

54
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,881
Coral?

55
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,382
Coral?

56
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,521
Coral?

57
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,294
Coral?

58
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,998
Coral?

59
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,746
Oh!

60
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,692
Ohh.

61
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,559
There, there, there.

62
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,087
lt's OK. Daddy's here.

63
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,994
Daddy's got you.

64
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:36,366
l promise, l will never
let anything happen to you...

65
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,172
Nemo.

66
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,083
NEMO: First day of school!

67
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,881
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

68
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,410
l don't want to go to school--
five more minutes.

69
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,717
Not you, Dad, me.

70
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,155
-OK. Huh?
-Get up, get up.

71
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,887
lt's time for school,
time for school.

72
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,485
All right, l'm up.

73
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,190
Whoa!

74
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,959
-Nemo!
-First day of school!

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,160
-Nemo, don't move.
-Unh! Unh!

76
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,600
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

77
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,797
l'll do it. Unh!

78
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,806
-You feel a break?
-No.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,569
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

80
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,803
-Are you woozy?
-No.

81
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,108
-How many stripes do l have?
-l'm fine.

82
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,943
-Answer the stripe question.
-Three.

83
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,448
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

84
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,281
l have one, two, three--
That's all l have?

85
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,220
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

86
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,053
-Lucky.
-Let's see.

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,016
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

88
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,962
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

89
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,862
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

90
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,561
-Forgot to brush.
-Ohh.

91
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,593
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

92
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,037
-Yes.
-Brush.

93
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,734
-OK, l'm done.
-You missed a spot.

94
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,075
-Where?
-There.

95
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,736
-Where?
-There.

96
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,746
Ha ha! Right there.
And here and here.

97
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:29,722
All right, we're excited.

98
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,882
All right, we're excited.

99
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,686
The first day of school.
Here we go.

100
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,693
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

101
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,127
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

102
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,597
-lt's not safe.
-That's my boy.

103
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,896
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

104
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,334
We go out...and back in.

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,668
And then we go out...
and back in.

106
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,732
And then one more time--
out and back in.

107
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,607
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times--

108
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,010
-Dad...
-All right, come on, boy.

109
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,810
Maybe while l'm at school,
l'll see a shark.

110
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,514
-l highly doubt that.
-Have you ever met a shark?

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,216
No, and l don't plan to.

112
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,454
-How old are sea turtles?
-l don't know.

113
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,188
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

114
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,131
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

115
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,565
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,864
lf l ever meet a sea turtle,
l'll ask him.

117
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,837
After l'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

118
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,440
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

119
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,465
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

120
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,703
Hold my fin.

121
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,075
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

122
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,103
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

123
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,911
MARLlN:
That snail was about to charge.

124
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,384
Hmm. l wonder where
we're supposed to go.

125
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,909
ALL: Bye, Mom!

126
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,047
l'll pick you up after school.

127
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,784
Ha ha!

128
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,885
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

129
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,920
Come on,
we'll try over there.

130
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,324
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

131
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,892
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

132
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,637
Yes. Shocking, l know.

133
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,126
Yes. Shocking, l know.

134
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,934
-Marty, right?
-Marlin.

135
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,133
-Bob.
-Ted.

136
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,165
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

137
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,770
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

138
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,109
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

139
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,048
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

140
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,608
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

141
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,643
-Come on, clownie.
-Do something funny.

142
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,156
All right, l know one joke.

143
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,251
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea--

144
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,353
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

145
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,261
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

146
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,859
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

147
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,369
Well, they--l'm mixed up.

148
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,133
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

149
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,174
None of them were walking,
so forget that l--

150
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,731
None of them were walking,
so forget that l--

151
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,005
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

152
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,410
-Whoa!
-All right, you kids!

153
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,507
Ooh, where'd you go?

154
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,711
Dad, can l go play, too?
Can l?

155
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,744
l would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

156
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,294
That's where l would play.

157
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,364
-What's wrong with his fin?
-He looks funny.

158
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,765
Ow! Hey, what'd l do?

159
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,769
Be nice.
lt's his first time at school.

160
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,499
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

161
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,801
-Dad...
-See this tentacle?

162
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,969
lt's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

163
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,138
but you can't really tell.

164
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,613
Especially when
l twirl them like this.

165
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,708
l'm H-2-O intolerant.

166
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,719
-Ah-choo!
-l'm obnoxious.

167
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,311
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

168
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,187
¶¶ Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones ¶¶

169
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,387
¶¶ Let's name
the zones of the open sea ¶¶

KlDS: Mr. Ray!

171
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,563
-Come on, Nemo.
-You better stay with me.

172
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,463

abyssalpelagic ¶¶

for you and me to see ¶¶

174
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,303
Huh. l wonder where
my class has gone?

175
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,069
ALL: We're under here!

176
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,973
Oh, there you are.

177
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,568
Climb aboard, explorers.

178
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,909
¶¶ Oh, knowledge

181
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,111
Dad, you can go now.

182
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,246
-Hello. Who is this?
-l'm Nemo.

183
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,951
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

184
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,790
-OK.
-You live in what kind of home?

185
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,523
An anemon-none.

186
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,554
A nemenem-menome.

187
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,625
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

188
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,602
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

189
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,298
l find if he's having
trouble swimming...

190
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,307
l let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

191
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,775
NEMO: Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

192
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,869
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

193
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,312
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

194
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,340
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

195
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,818
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

196
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:20,953
JlMMY: Aw, man!

197
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,818
JlMMY: Aw, man!

198
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,880
Bye, Nemo!

199
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,323
Bye, Dad!

200
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,020
Bye, son!

201
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,026
Be safe.

202
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,624
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

203
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,999
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

204
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,266
l had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

205
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,569
They got to grow up--
The drop off?

206
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,474
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

207
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,809
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

208
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,109
Hey, Marty, calm down.

209
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,412
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

210
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,748
Pony boy?

211
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,653
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

212
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,088
Pity.

213
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,988
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

217
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,961

Come on, sing with me.

223
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,941
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

224
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,681
Just the girls this time.

225
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,686
¶¶ Oh, seaweed is cool ¶¶

226

228
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,818
OK, the drop off.

229
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,125
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

230
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,324
but stay close.

231
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,560
Stromalitic
cyanobacteria! Gather.

232
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,632
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

233
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,332
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

234
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,807
Come on, let's go.

235
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,207
Come on, sing with me!

236
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,507

239
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,675
Hey, guys, wait up!

240
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,983
Whoa.

241
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,716
Cool.

242
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,021
Saved your life!

243
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,394
Aw, you guys made me ink.

244
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,266
What's that?

245
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,728
TAD: l know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

246
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,866
He said it was called a butt.

247
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,341
-Whoa.
-Wow.

248
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,674
That's a pretty big butt.

249
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,344
Oh, look at me.
l'm going to touch the butt.

250
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,851
-Ah-choo! Whoa!
-Ha ha ha!

251
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,684
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

252
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,349
OK.

253
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,881
Beat that.

254
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,451
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

255
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,964
My dad says it's not safe.

256
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,933
-Nemo! No!
-Dad?

257
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,401
You were about
to swim into open water.

258
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,664
No, l wasn't--

259
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,535
Good thing l was here.
lf l hadn't shown up--

260
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,836
-He wasn't going to go.
-He was too afraid.

261
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,172
No, l wasn't.

262
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,642
This does not
concern you, kids...

263
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,043
and you're lucky
l don't tell your parents.

264
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,377
You know you can't swim well.

265
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,348
l can swim fine, Dad, OK?

266
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,284
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

267
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,719
OK, l was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

268
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,485
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean--

269
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:12,992
Clearly, you're not ready...

270
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,686
Clearly, you're not ready...

271
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,886
and you're not coming back
until you are.

272
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,189
You think
you can do these things...

273
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,128
but you just can't, Nemo!

274
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,057
l hate you.

275
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,896
¶¶ There's ¶¶

276
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,768
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

277
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,068
Excuse me.
ls there anything l can do?

278
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,166
l am a scientist, sir.
ls there any problem?

279
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,302
l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to interrupt things.

280
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,177
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

281
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,943
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

282
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,745
MR. RAY: l can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

283
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,753
MARLlN: l'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

284
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,620
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

285
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:44,857
l'm not saying
you're not looking.

286
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,846
l'm not saying
you're not looking.

287
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,826
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

288
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,891
Nemo!

289
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,994
What do you think you're doing?

290
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,832
You'll get stuck out there...

291
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,362
and l'll have to get you
before another fish does.

292
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,304
Get back here!

293
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,334
l said get back here now!

294
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:11,213
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

295
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,115
Don't you dare!

296
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,211
lf you put one fin
on that boat...

297
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,744
Are you listening to me?

298
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,418
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

299
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,857
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

300
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,057
That's right.

301
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,793
You are in big trouble,
young man.

302
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,630
Do you hear me? Big...

303
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,405
-Big...
-Aah!

304
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,604
Aah!

305
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,701
Daddy! Help me!

306
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,713
l'm coming, Nemo!

307
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,949
-Aah!
-Get under me, kids!

308
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,383
Aah! Oh! No!

309
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,113
Dad!

310
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,553
Daddy!

311
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,659
Oh! Nemo!

312
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,089
Unh. Nemo!

313
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,762
Nemo, no! Nemo!

314
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,772
Nemo! Nemo! No!

315
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,166
No!

316
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,112
Aah!

317
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,474
Uhh.

318
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,610
Nemo! Nemo!

319
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,127
Whoa! Hold on.

320
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,140
Oh, no.

321
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,774
No. No, it's gone.
lt's gone.

322
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,113
No, no,
it can't be gone.

323
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,483
No, no! Nemo!

324
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,121
Nemo! Nemo!

325
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,713
Nemo! Nemo!

326
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,986
No!

327
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,686
Nemo! Nemo!

328
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,526
No! No, please, no!

329
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,528
No, no!

330
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,461
Has anybody seen a boat?

331
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,336
Please! A white boat!

332
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,035
They took my son!

333
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,578
My son! Help me, please.

334
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,478
-Look out!
-What?

335
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,913
Ooh. Ohh.

336
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,544
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry.
l didn't see you.

337
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,885
-Sir? Are you OK?
-He's gone, he's gone.

338
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,356
There, there.
lt's all right.

339
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,653
-He's gone.
-lt'll be OK.

340
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,253
No, no. They took him away.
l have to find the boat.

341
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,355
A boat?
Hey, l've seen a boat.

342
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,696
-You have?
-lt passed by not too long ago.

343
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,100
-A white one?
-Hi. l'm Dory.

344
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,330
Where? Which way?

345
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,532
Oh, oh, oh.
lt went this way.

346
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,972
lt went this way.
Follow me.

347
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,375
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

348
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,537
No problem.

349
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,129
MARLlN: Hey...

350
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,571
Wait!

351
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,772
-Will you quit it?
-What?

352
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,579
l'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

353
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:32,951
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

354
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,816
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

355
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,549
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

356
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,454
Ooh, l'm scared now. What?

357
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,085
-Wait a minute.
-Stop following me, OK?

358
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,255
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

359
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,899
A boat?
Hey, l've seen a boat.

360
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,329
lt passed by not too long ago.
lt went this way.

361
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,768
lt went this way.
Follow me.

362
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,931
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

363
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,270
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

364
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,505
l did? Oh, no.

365
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,843
lf this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

366
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,178
And l know funny.
l'm a clownfish.

367
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,617
No, it's not. l know it's not.
l'm so sorry.

368
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,622
See, l suffer from
short-term memory loss.

369
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,490
Short-term memory loss.
l don't believe this.

370
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,391
No, it's true. l forget things
almost instantly.

371
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,387
lt runs in my family.
At least, l think it does.

372
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,459
Um, hmm. Where are they?

373
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,642
Can l help you?

374
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,304
Something's wrong
with you--really.

375
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,210
You're wasting my time.

376
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,306
l have to find my son.

377
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,110
Hello.

378
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,145
-Ohh.
-Well, hi!

379
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,215
Name's Bruce.

380
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,022
lt's all right.
l understand.

381
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,792
Why trust a shark, right?

382
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,966
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

383
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,669
doing out so late, eh?

384
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,735
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

385
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,008
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

386
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,312
like to come to a little
get-together l'm having?

387
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,545
You mean, like a party?

388
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,646
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

389
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,850
l love parties.
That sounds like fun.

390
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,292
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but--

391
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,229
Oh, come on, l insist.

392
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,462
MARLlN: OK.
That's all that matters.

393
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,265
DORY: Hey, look, balloons.
lt is a party.

394
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,638
BRUCE: Ha ha ha ha!
Mind your distance, though.

395
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,337
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

396
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,676
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

397
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,155
MARLlN: Oh.

398
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,619
Ohh.

399
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,255
Anchor! Chum!

400
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,095
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

401
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,795
-We got company.
-lt's about time, mate.

402
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,703
We've already gone
through the snacks...

403
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,294
We've already gone
through the snacks...

404
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,895
and l'm still starving.

405
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,134
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

406
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,903
Come on,
let's get this over with.

407
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,736
BRUCE: Right, then.

408
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,077
The meeting has officially
come to order.

409
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,604
Let us all say the pledge.

410
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,143
l am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

411
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,815
lf l am to change this image...

412
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,290
l must first change myself.

413
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,056
Fish are friends, not food.

414
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,426
Except stinkin' dolphins.

415
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,489
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

416
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,262
''Look at me.
l'm a flippin' little dolphin.

417
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,962
''Let me flip for you.
Ain't l something?''

418
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,597
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5--

419
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,300
Bring a Fish Friend.

420
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,831
Do you all have your friends?

421
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,035
Got mine.

422
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,038
-Hey, there.
-How about you, Chum?

423
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,609
Oh, l...seem to have
misplaced my friend.

424
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,585
BRUCE: That's all right, Chum.

425
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,146
l had a feeling
this would be a difficult step.

426
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,714
You can help yourself
to one of my friends.

427
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,216
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

428
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,923
BRUCE: l'll start
the testimonies.

429
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,193
Hello. My name is Bruce.

430
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,494
BOTH: Hello, Bruce.

431
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,694
lt has been three weeks
since my last fish.

432
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,172
On my honor, or may l be
chopped up and made into soup.

433
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,970
-You're an inspiration!
-Amen.

434
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,643
Right, then. Who's next?

435
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,975
DORY: Pick me, pick me.

436
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,878
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

437
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,973
-Whoo!
-Come on up here.

438
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,816
Hi. l'm Dory.

439
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,253
-Hello, Dory.
-And, uh, well...

440
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,452
l don't think
l've ever eaten a fish.

441
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:37,053
-That's incredible.
-Good on you, mate.

442
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,120
l'm glad
l got that off my chest.

443
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,495
All right, anyone else?

444
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,126
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

445
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,398
MARLlN: Me?
l don't have a problem.

446
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,802
Oh, OK.

447
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,430
-Denial.
-Aah!

448
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,304
BRUCE: Just start
with your name.

449
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,038
OK. Uh, hello.

450
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,172
My name is Marlin.
l'm a clownfish.

451
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,240
-A clownfish? Really?
-Tell us a joke.

452
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,013
l love jokes.

453
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,045
l actually do know one
that's pretty good.

454
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,114
There was this mollusk...

455
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,490
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

456
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,358
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

457
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,363
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

458
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,457
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

459
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,763
NEMO: Daddy!

460
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,136
Nemo!

461
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,199
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo!
l don't get it.

462
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,142
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

463
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,009
No, no, no, no.
He's my son.

464
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,105
He was taken by these divers.

465
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,852
Humans--think they own
everything.

466
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,148
Probably American.

467
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,189
Now, there is a father--
Looking for his little boy.

468
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,317
Now, there is a father--
Looking for his little boy.

469
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,850
MARLlN: What do
these markings mean?

470
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,663
-Group hug.
-We're all mates here, mate.

471
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,927
l can't read human.

472
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,229
DORY: We got to find a fish
that can read this.

473
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,236
-Hey, look, sharks.
-No, no, no, Dory!

474
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,397
-Guys, guys.
-No, Dory.

475
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,770
That's mine.
Give it to me.

476
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,274
Gimme! Ow!

477
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,277
Oh, l'm sorry.
Are you OK?

478
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,709
-Ow, ow, ow.
-l'm so sorry.

479
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,873
You really clocked me there.
Am l bleeding?

480
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,814
-Ohh.
-Ow, ow, ow.

481
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,411
Dory, are you OK--Ohh.

482
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,254
Ohh, that's good.

483
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,984
Ohh, that's good.

484
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,923
BOTH: lntervention!

485
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,553
-Just a bite.
-Hold it together, mate!

486
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,223
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

487
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,366
-Food!
-Dory, look out!

488
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,162
-Food!
-Dory, look out!

489
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,761
-Aah!
-l'm having fish tonight!

490
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,396
Remember the steps, mate!

491
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,964
MARLlN: Aah!

492
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,171
-Aah! Whoa!
-Aah!

493
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,475
-Just one bite!
-Aah!

494
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,316
G'day. Grr!

495
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,617
There's no way out!

496
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,419
There's got to be a way
to escape!

497
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,961
Who is it?

498
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,326
Dory, help me
find a way out!

499
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,888
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

500
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,500
-There's got to be a way out!
-Here's something.

501
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,267
''Es-cap-e.''
l wonder what that means.

502
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,830
Funny. lt's spelled
just like ''escape.''

503
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,136
-Let's go.
-Aah!

504
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,270
Here's Brucey!

505
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,007
Wait a minute.
You can read?

506
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,038
l can read?
That's right. l can read!

507
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,209
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

508
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,219
-Aah!
-Ohh!

509
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,017
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

510
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,284
CHUM:
Don't fall off the wagon!

511
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,882
-Aah!
-Aah!

512
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,797
Oh, no, it's blocked!

513
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,332
No, Bruce, focus.

514
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,496
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

515
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,200
He's really a nice guy.

516
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,469
l need to get that mask.

517
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,101
You want that mask? OK.

518
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,908
No, no, no, no, no, no!

519
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,472
Quick, grab the mask!

520
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,186
Oh, no. Bruce?

521
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,850
What?

522
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,191
DORY:
Aw, is the party over?

523
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,474
Nice.

524
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:14,729
Dad?

525
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,767
Daddy?

526
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,204
Huh?

527
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,572
Aah! Uhh!

528
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:30,279
Uhh!

529
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,564
-Barbara.
-Uh-huh?

530
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,430
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

531
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,902
And l'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

532
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,564
BARBARA: OK.

533
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,036
Hello, little fella.

534
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,269
Aah!

535
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,470
Heh heh heh!
Beauty, isn't he?

536
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,842
l found that guy
struggling for life...

537
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,574
out on the reef,
and l saved him.

538
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:00,707
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

539
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,947
PATlENT: l think so.
We're ready to roll.

540
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:06,711
Bubbles!

541
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,284
My bubbles.

542
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:12,692
He likes bubbles.

543
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:16,425
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

544
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,434
-Bonjour.
-Aah!

545
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:29,274
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

546
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:32,542
-He's scared to death.
-l want to go home.

547
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:34,606
Do you know where my dad is?

548
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,414
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

549
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:38,613
Pet store?

550
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:41,350
Yeah, you know, like,
l'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

551
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,948
-Pet Palace.
-Fish-O-Rama.

552
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,459
-Mail order.
-Ebay.

553
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:47,189
-So, which one is it?
-l'm from the ocean.

554
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,163
Ah, the ocean. The ocean?

555
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:51,098
Aah! Aah! Aah!

556
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,829
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

557
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,200
-Oui.
-Clean him!

558
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,761
Oui.

559
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:59,240
-Ocean.
-Ooh, la mer. Bon.

560
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:03,203
Voila. He is clean.

561
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,946
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

562
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:13,011
-Big and blue?
-l knew it.

563
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:16,252
lf there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

564
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,386
Or if l'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

565
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,191
Hi. How are you?

566
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,754
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

567
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:24,629
She's nuts.
Ha ha ha ha!

568
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,759
We got a live one.

569
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,827
-Can't hear you, Peach.
-l said we got a live one.

570
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:30,839
-Boy, oh, boy.
-What do we got?

571
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:32,397
Root canal--and by the looks
of those x-rays...

572
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:33,908
it's not going to be pretty.

573
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,638
Ow!

574
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:37,111
-Dam and clamp installed?
-Yep.

575
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:38,943
-What did he use to open?
-Gator-Glidden drill.

576
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:40,642
He seems to favor
that one lately.

577
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:43,618
l can't see, Flo.

578
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:45,779
You're getting
a little too--Aah!

579
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,015
PEACH: Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

580
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,455
BLOAT: He's using
a Hedstrom file.

581
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:50,686
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

582
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:53,354
lt has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

583
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:54,885
-No, no, K-Flex.
-Hedstrom.

584
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,625
-K-Flex!
-Hedstrom!

585
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:58,724
There l go.
A little help, over here.

586
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,631
DEB: l'll go deflate him.

587
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:05,233
DENTlST: All right.
Go ahead and rinse.

588
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:08,607
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

589
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:12,980
-Hey, Nigel.
-What did l miss?

590
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:14,175
PEACH: Root canal--a doozy.

591
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:15,843
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

592
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:17,910
-Gator-Glidden drill.
-He's favoring that one.

593
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:20,945
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

594
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,084
-Hello. Who's this?
-New guy. Ha ha ha!

595
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:25,457
The dentist
took him off the reef.

596
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,860
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

597
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,387
Sorry if l ever took
a snap at you.

598
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,830
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

599
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,561
Hey! No, no, no, no!

600
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,193
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

601
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:37,034
Come on, go.
Go on, shoo!

602
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:40,035
Aw, the picture broke.

603
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,134
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

604
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,644
She's going to be
eight this week.

605
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,146
Hey, little fella.

606
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,943
Say hello
to your new mummy.

607
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,450
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

608
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,316
You're her present.
Shh, shh, shh.

609
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,412
lt's our little secret.

610
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:54,979
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

611
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,992
l'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

612
00:28:58,827 --> 00:29:00,727
Oh, Darla.

613
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:02,628
What?
What's wrong with her?

614
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:05,361
GURGLE: She wouldn't stop
shaking the bag.

615
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:09,167
-Poor Chuckles.
-He was her present last year.

616
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:11,570
BLOAT: Hitched a ride
on the porcelain express.

617
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,637
PEACH: She's a fish killer.

618
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,942
l can't go with that girl.

619
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,743
l have to get back
to my dad.

620
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:23,684
Aah! Daddy! Help me!

621
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,879
Oh, he's stuck.

622
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,115
GlLL: Nobody touch him.

623
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:31,359
Nobody touch him.

624
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,532
Can you help me?

625
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:38,934
No. You got yourself
in there.

626
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,561
No. You got yourself
in there.

627
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:42,264
You can get yourself out.

628
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,568
-Gill--
-l want to see him do it.

629
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:48,441
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

you are able to swim through...

788
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,670
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

789
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:07,334
You said you could do it.

790
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,967
The Ring of Fire!

791
00:38:11,346 --> 00:38:13,473
Bubbles, let me--Oh!

792
00:38:13,515 --> 00:38:16,279
¶¶ Ha hwa ha ho ho ho ¶¶

793
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,650
¶¶ Ha hwa ha ho ho ho ¶¶

794
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:21,019
¶¶ Ha hwa ha ho ho ho ¶¶

795
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:24,150
lsn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

796
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:39,633
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

797
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,005
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

798
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:42,805
Welcome,
Brother Sharkbait.

799
00:38:42,844 --> 00:38:44,072
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

800
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:46,137
-Enough with the Sharkbait.
-Sharkbait!

801
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,046
Ooh...ba-ba-do.

802
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,641
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

803
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:51,743
-Agreed.
-We can't send him to his death.

804
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:53,879
Darla's coming in five days.

805
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:55,480
So, what are we going to do?

806
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:58,084
l'll tell you
what we're gonna do--

807
00:38:58,126 --> 00:38:59,684
we're gonna get him
out of here.

808
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:02,253
-We'll help him escape.
-Escape? Really?

809
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,764
We're all gonna escape.

810
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:06,426
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

811
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:08,493
Sorry,
but they just never work.

812
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,671
Why should this
be any different?

813
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:10,069
Why should this
be any different?

814
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:13,563
-Because we've got him.
-Me?

815
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:15,377
-You see that filter?
-Yeah.

816
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:18,813
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

817
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:22,010
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

818
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,278
and jam the gears.

819
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:25,286
You do that,
and this tank's gonna get...

820
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,288
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

821
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,654
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

822
00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:32,592
and when he does, he'll take us
out of the tank...

823
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:34,185
put us in
individual baggies...

824
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:36,026
then we'll roll ourselves
down the counter...

825
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,725
out the window,
off the awning...

826
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,427
into the bushes,
across the street...

827
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,935
and into the harbor!

828
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,905
lt's foolproof.
Who's with me?

829
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,339
-Aye!
-Aye!

830
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:47,807
l think you're nuts.

831
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:51,810
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

832
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:54,246
He's fine. He can do this.

833
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:57,740
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

834
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:02,724
Let's do it.

835
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:05,693
DORY: l'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

836
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,024
Where are you going?

837
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:08,723
l'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

838
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,390
lf you ask
where l'm going...

839
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:12,161
l'll tell you
that's where l'm going.

840
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,667
lt's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

841
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,465
Where? l'm sorry,
l didn't hear you.

842
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,061
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

843
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,903
MARLlN: Excuse me.

844
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:21,738
Hi.
Do you know how to get--

845
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:24,745
Hello? Whoa. Wait.
Can you tell me--

846
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:29,113
Hey! Hold it!
l'm trying to talk to you!

847
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,517
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

848
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:36,957
l need to--
And they're gone again.

849
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,755
DORY: P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

850
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:40,454
Why do l have to tell you
over and over again?

851
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,486
l'll tell you again.
l don't get tired of it--

852
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,690
-OK, all right.
-Huh?

853
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,427
-Here's the thing.
-Uh-huh.

854
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:50,962
l think it's best
if l carry on from here by...

855
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,371
by myself.

856
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:53,601
OK.

857
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:55,337
-You know, alone.
-Uh-huh.

858
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:57,402
Without--without--
l mean, not without you.

859
00:40:57,445 --> 00:41:00,812
But l don't
want you...with me.

860
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,181
-Huh?
-Am l...

861
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:04,378
l don't want to hurt
your feelings.

862
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:07,217
-You want me to leave?
-l mean, not--Yes.

863
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,689
l just can't afford
any more delays...

864
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:12,921
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

865
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,588
Sometimes it's a good thing.

866
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:17,655
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

867
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,257
You mean...

868
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,962
You mean you don't like me?

869
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,799
No, of course l like you.

870
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:25,533
lt's because l like you
l don't want to be with you.

871
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:27,734
lt's a complicated emotion.

872
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,473
-Ohh!
-Don't cry. l like you.

873
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:35,882
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

874
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,851
Um...l don't remember.
Were you?

875
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,786
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just--

876
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:41,584
Do you guys know
how l can get to--

877
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,955
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

878
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:45,584
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

879
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:47,652
Mm-hmm.

880
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:50,028
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

881
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:51,623
So what are we?
Take a guess.

882
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,963
DORY: Oh, oh.
l've seen one of those.

883
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:55,196
l'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

884
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,204
-Wait, wait, um--
-lt's a swordfish!

885
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:59,007
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

886
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,269
LEADER: Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

887
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:01,866
Where's the butter?

888
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,309
Ooh! lt's on
the tip of my tongue!

889
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,336
-Lobster.
-Saw that!

890
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,211
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

891
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:08,647
-Clam!
-Close enough!

892
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,173
¶¶ Oh, it's a whale
of a tale ¶¶

893
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:11,685
¶¶ l'll tell you, lad... ¶¶

894
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,709
They're good.

895
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:14,051
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

896
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:16,455
''Will somebody please
give me directions?!''

897
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,516
-Ha ha ha ha ha!
-l'm serious!

898
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,551
''Blah blah blah,
me, me, blah!

899
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:21,789
''Blah blah blah,
me, me, me!''

900
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,320
Thank you.

901
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:25,856
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

902
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,036
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

903
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:28,559
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

904
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:30,571
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

905
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:34,735
l am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

906
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,073
l bet that's frustrating.

907
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:37,544
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

908
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:39,570
-Your son Chico?
-Nemo?

909
00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:41,013
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

910
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,017
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

911
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:46,817
Well, l'm helping you.

912
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,186
Wait right here.

913
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:52,018
-Guys!
-ls he bothering you again?

914
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,584
No, no. He's a good guy.

915
00:42:53,628 --> 00:42:54,629
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

916
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:55,857
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

917
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:58,764
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

918
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,495
Sydney? Oh, sure!

919
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:03,265
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

920
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,931
-Don't you, Ted?
-Sure do!

921
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:06,463
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

922
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,199
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

923
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:11,212
You want to follow the E.A.C.

924
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:13,942
That's the East
Australian Current.

925
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:15,609
Big current.
Can't miss it.

926
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,619
lt's in...that direction.

927
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,553
And then you follow that
for about...

928
00:43:20,588 --> 00:43:22,351
l don't know.
What do you guys think?

929
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,550
About three leagues?

930
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:26,560
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

931
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:29,028
-Ta-da!
-That's great!

932
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:30,257
Dory, you did it!

933
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:32,129
Oh, please,
l'm just your little helper.

934
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,499
-Helping along. That's me.
-Fellas, thank you.

935
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:38,165
LEADER: Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

936
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:41,198
DORY: Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

937
00:43:41,242 --> 00:43:43,073
LEADER: Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

938
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:46,672
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

939
00:43:46,714 --> 00:43:48,614
DORY: Trench...
through it, not over it.

940
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,346
l'll remember. Hey, hey!

941
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:55,051
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

942
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:57,819
Wait, wait, wait!
l gotta tell you something.

943
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,555
Whoa.

944
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,893
DORY: Nice trench.

945
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:07,624
Hello!

946
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:12,966
-OK, let's go.
-No, no. Bad trench.

947
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:14,668
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

948
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:16,836
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

949
00:44:16,878 --> 00:44:20,507
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

950
00:44:20,548 --> 00:44:22,175
Are you looking at this thing?

951
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:23,707
lt's got death
written all over it.

952
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,584
l really, really, really
think we should swim through.

953
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,851
And l'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

954
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,858
-Trust me on this.
-Trust you?

955
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:32,757
Yes, trust.
lt's what friends do.

956
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:34,694
Look! Something shiny!

957
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:36,492
-Where?
-lt just swam over the trench.

958
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:42,237
-Come on, we'll follow it!
-OK!

959
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:44,899
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

960
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:48,397
Exactly. And look at that--
there's the current.

961
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:51,037
We should be there in no time.

962
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,876
Hey, little guy.

963
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:54,677
You wanted to go
through the trench.

964
00:44:54,716 --> 00:44:56,741
l shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

965
00:44:56,784 --> 00:44:58,945
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

966
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:00,486
Come here, little Squishy.

967
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,518
Ow!

968
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:06,425
-That's a jellyfish!
-Bad Squishy!

969
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,258
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

970
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:10,594
-Let me see that.
-Don't touch it.

971
00:45:10,632 --> 00:45:12,964
l won't touch it.
l just want to look.

972
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,026
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

973
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:16,593
lt did.
lt's just that--

974
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,333
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-Hold still.

975
00:45:18,373 --> 00:45:19,840
l live in this anemone...

976
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:21,739
and l'm used
to these kind of stings.

977
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:22,936
Ow! Ow! Ow!

978
00:45:22,977 --> 00:45:24,968
lt doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

979
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,742
But now we know, don't we...

980
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,976
that we don't want
to touch these again.

981
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,043
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

982
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:34,486
-Aah!
-Aah!

983
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:35,784
Don't move.

984
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,426
-This is bad, Dory.
-Hey, watch this!

985
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:40,519
-This is bad, Dory.
-Hey, watch this!

986
00:45:40,562 --> 00:45:42,223
Boing! Boing!

987
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,491
Dory!

988
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,863
¶¶ You can't catch me ¶¶

989
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,367
Don't bounce on the tops!

990
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:50,530
They will...not sting you!

991
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:53,234
-The tops don't sting you!
-Two in a row! Beat that!

992
00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:56,209
Dory, listen to me.
l have an idea--a game.

993
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:57,711
-A game?
-Yes.

994
00:45:57,812 --> 00:46:00,474
-l love games! Pick me!
-Here's the game.

995
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:03,973
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

996
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:05,645
-OK.
-Rules, rules, rules!

997
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:08,247
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

998
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,154
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

999
00:46:10,191 --> 00:46:13,126
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

1000
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:14,355
-Whee!
-Wait, Dory!

1001
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:15,096
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1002
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:16,495
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1003
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:17,691
Whoa! Dory!

1004
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:19,700
Boing, boing, boing!

1005
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:22,601
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

1006
00:46:22,637 --> 00:46:24,161
Whee!

1007
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:27,470
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

1008
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:29,169
But we're having fun
at the same time.

1009
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,643
l can do this.
Just be careful.

1010
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:32,578
Yeah, careful l don't
make you cry when l win!

1011
00:46:32,614 --> 00:46:33,774
l don't think so!

1012
00:46:33,815 --> 00:46:35,339
Ha ha ha ha!

1013
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:37,180
Whoa!

1014
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,378
Give it up, old man.

1015
00:46:38,419 --> 00:46:40,683
You can't fight evolution.
l was built for speed.

1016
00:46:40,722 --> 00:46:42,690
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

1017
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:44,055
-Hungry?
-Yeah.

1018
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,822
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

1019
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:49,022
Duck to the left!
Right there!

1020
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:53,833
The clownfish is the winner!

1021
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:56,928
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Look at us!

1022
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:58,498
Dory?

1023
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,132
Oh, no.

1024
00:47:03,202 --> 00:47:05,500
Dory! Dory!

1025
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:07,631
Dory!

1026
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:11,839
Dory!

1027
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,745
DORY: Am l disqualified?

1028
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:20,752
MARLlN: No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

1029
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:23,914
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

1030
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:26,857
DORY: P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

1031
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:28,656
MARLlN: That's it!

1032
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:29,854
Uhh!

1033
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:32,592
-Wallaby Way...
-Uhh! Stay awake!

1034
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,930
Stay awake!
Ooh! Stay awake!

1035
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:38,733
Stay...awake!

1036
00:47:41,274 --> 00:47:44,539
-Awake.
-P. Sherman.

1037
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:47,569
-Awake.
-42 Wallaby Way.

1038
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:51,183
Wake up. Nemo...

1039
00:47:51,183 --> 00:47:51,581
Wake up. Nemo...

1040
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:08,665
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

1041
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:09,569
Yeah.

1042
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:10,058
Yeah.

1043
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:14,095
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

1044
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,301
He's not looking for me.

1045
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:19,709
He's scared of the ocean.

1046
00:48:19,745 --> 00:48:21,303
Peach, any movement?

1047
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,281
He's had four cups of coffee.
lt's gotta be soon.

1048
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:25,841
Keep on him.

1049
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:31,087
My first escape--
landed on dental tools.

1050
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:32,556
l was aiming for the toilet.

1051
00:48:32,592 --> 00:48:33,786
Toilet?

1052
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:36,420
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

1053
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:39,727
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

1054
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:41,357
Ah, l've lost count.

1055
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,334
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

1056
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:45,030
lt does things to you.

1057
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:49,605
Potty break! He grabbed
the ''Reader's Digest.''

1058
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:53,043
-We have 4.2 minutes!
-That's your cue, Sharkbait.

1059
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,377
-You can do it, kid.
-We gotta be quick.

1060
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:55,615
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1061
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:58,049
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1062
00:48:58,084 --> 00:48:59,847
and l'll talk you
through the rest.

1063
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:02,683
-OK.
-lt'll be a piece of kelp.

1064
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,495
Nicely done!

1065
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:14,260
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah!

1066
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,791
Here comes the pebble.

1067
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,264
Ptoo.

1068
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:24,539
Now, do you see
a small opening?

1069
00:49:24,577 --> 00:49:26,010
Uh-huh!

1070
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,208
lnside it,
you'll see a rotating fan.

1071
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:33,776
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

1072
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:38,486
Aah!

1073
00:49:38,524 --> 00:49:40,822
-Careful, Sharkbait!
-l can't do it!

1074
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,384
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

1075
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:44,191
He'll be fine. Try again!

1076
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,926
OK.

1077
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:49,434
GlLL: That's it, Sharkbait.

1078
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:51,766
Nice and steady.

1079
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,798
l got it! l got it!

1080
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,571
-He did it!
-That's great, kid!

1081
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:00,806
Now swim up the tube
and out.

1082
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:20,827
Oh, no! Gill!

1083
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,060
-Sharkbait!
-Oh, my gosh!

1084
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:23,329
Get him outta there!

1085
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:25,894
-What do we do?
-Oh, no!

1086
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:27,906
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1087
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:30,340
Help me!

1088
00:50:30,376 --> 00:50:32,742
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1089
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:38,216
-No! No! No!
-Feed me more!

1090
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,185
-That's it!
-Sharkbait! Grab it!

1091
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,916
l got it!

1092
00:50:43,956 --> 00:50:45,753
Pull!

1093
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:55,127
PEACH: Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1094
00:50:56,368 --> 00:51:00,395
No. We're done.

1095
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:15,147
CRUSH: Dude.

1096
00:51:15,187 --> 00:51:18,247
-Uhh.
-Dude.

1097
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,784
Focus, dude. Dude.

1098
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:24,455
Ohh.

1099
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:26,089
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!

1100
00:51:26,132 --> 00:51:29,499
MARLlN:
Ohh. What happened?

1101
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:31,594
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1102
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:33,502
First, you were all,
like, ''Whoa!''...

1103
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:35,166
and then we were
all, like, ''Whoa!''...

1104
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,107
and then you were,
like, ''Whoa.''

1105
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:38,576
MARLlN:
What are you talking about?

1106
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:42,047
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1107
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:44,914
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

1108
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,212
-Ohh.
-Awesome.

1109
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:49,449
Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!

1110
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:51,456
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1111
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,684
Just waxed it.

1112
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:54,955
So, Mr. Turtle--

1113
00:51:54,994 --> 00:51:57,360
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

1114
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:58,829
The name's Crush.

1115
00:51:58,864 --> 00:52:01,196
Crush? Really?

1116
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:05,897
OK, Crush. l need to
the East Australian Current.

1117
00:52:05,938 --> 00:52:07,166
E.A.C.?

1118
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,140
Oh, dude.

1119
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,541
You're ridin' it, dude!

1120
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:14,205
Check it out!

1121
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:36,999
OK, grab shell, dude!

1122
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:38,804
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1123
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:39,361
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1124
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,842
Ha ha! Righteous!
Righteous!

1125
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:55,621
-Yeah!
-Stop!

1126
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:58,089
So...

1127
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:01,650
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1128
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:04,288
Dory and l need
to get to Sydney.

1129
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,560
Dory!
ls she all right?

1130
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,396
Huh? Oh, little blue.

1131
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:11,093
She is sub-level, dude.

1132
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:17,801
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1133
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:19,572
Dory.

1134
00:53:21,313 --> 00:53:24,146
l'm so sorry.

1135
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:27,516
This is all my fault.
lt's my fault.

1136
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:32,524
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here l come!

1137
00:53:32,524 --> 00:53:34,549
There you are!

1138
00:53:35,828 --> 00:53:38,695
Catch me if you can!

1139
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,097
Dory?

1140
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:42,964
KlD: Nice wave!

1141
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,027
Oh, wow!

1142
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,731
Heh heh.

1143
00:53:46,772 --> 00:53:47,206
Up you go!

1144
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:48,605
Up you go!

1145
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:51,633
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1146
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:53,110
Whoa! Whoa!

1147
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:56,745
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1148
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:01,245
-Oh, my goodness!
-Kill the motor, dude.

1149
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:04,620
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1150
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:13,058
Whoa!

1151
00:54:13,098 --> 00:54:16,090
Whoa! That was so cool!

1152
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:17,932
Hey, Dad,
did you see that?

1153
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,302
Did you see me?
Did you see what l did?

1154
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,308
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1155
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,866
So give me some fin.

1156
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,309
Noggin.

1157
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:27,710
-Dude.
-Dude.

1158
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:29,145
Oh...intro.

1159
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:31,081
Jellyman, offspring.

1160
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:33,175
Offspring, Jellyman.

1161
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:36,745
-Jellies?! Sweet.
-Totally.

1162
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:40,020
Apparently, l must've done
something you liked...dudes.

1163
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:42,493
-You rock, dude!
-Ow.

1164
00:54:42,528 --> 00:54:47,261
Curl away, my son.
lt's awesome, Jellyman.

1165
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:48,960
The little dudes
are just eggs.

1166
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:50,764
We leave 'em
on a beach to hatch...

1167
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:52,065
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1168
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:54,504
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1169
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,872
-All by themselves?
-Yeah.

1170
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:59,901
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1171
00:54:59,945 --> 00:55:01,173
Well, you never really know.

1172
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:04,614
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1173
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,287
Hey, look, everybody.

1174
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:13,018
l know that dude!
lt's the Jellyman!

1175
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:15,083
DORY: Go on. Jump on him!

1176
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:18,324
-Turtle pile!
-Wait, wait, wait!

1177
00:55:18,364 --> 00:55:20,423
-Are you funny?
-Where's your shell?

1178
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:22,525
-l need to breathe!
-Are you running away?

1179
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:24,229
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1180
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:26,237
-Did they sting you?
-One at a time!

1181
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:27,932
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1182
00:55:27,973 --> 00:55:30,498
DORY: Sorry, l was
a little vague on the details.

1183
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:31,702
So, where are you going?

1184
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:33,609
You see, my son was taken.

1185
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:36,478
My son was taken away from me.

1186
00:55:36,515 --> 00:55:38,779
-No way.
-What happened?

1187
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:40,978
No, no, kids.
l don't want to talk about it.

1188
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,352
ALL: Aww! Please?

1189
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:44,720
Please?

1190
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:47,493
Well, OK.

1191
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:51,327
l live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1192
00:55:51,363 --> 00:55:53,388
This is gonna be good.
l can tell.

1193
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:55,832
And my son Nemo...

1194
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:57,836
See, he was mad at me.

1195
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,497
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1196
00:55:59,538 --> 00:56:01,028
if l hadn't been
so tough on him.

1197
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:02,301
l don't know.

1198
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:04,332
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1199
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:07,243
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1200
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:09,907
and l tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1201
00:56:09,948 --> 00:56:11,711
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1202
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,082
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1203
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,883
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1204
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,219
...three ferocious sharks.

1205
00:56:18,257 --> 00:56:20,350
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1206
00:56:20,392 --> 00:56:21,723
Golly, that's amazing.

1207
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,387
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1208
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:25,158
...straight down
into the dark.

1209
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:26,664
lt's wicked dark down there.

1210
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:28,393
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1211
00:56:28,434 --> 00:56:30,095
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1212
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:31,864
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1213
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:33,872
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1214
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:35,271
And then he has
to blast his way...

1215
00:56:35,307 --> 00:56:36,934
So, these two little fish
have been...

1216
00:56:36,975 --> 00:56:40,512
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1217
00:56:40,512 --> 00:56:42,844
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1218
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:44,405
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1219
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,747
...in a matter of days.
l mean, it sounds like...

1220
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:47,775
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1221
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,584
...till he finds his son.
l sure hope he makes it.

1222
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:53,614
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1223
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:01,165
GULLS: Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1224
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,502
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1225
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:08,233
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1226
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:11,674
Would you just shut up?!

1227
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,177
You're rats with wings!

1228
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:14,702
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1229
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:17,078
-Nemo?!
-He was taken off the reef...

1230
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:20,142
-Take it! You happy?
-Mine! Mine! Mine!

1231
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:22,983
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1232
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:24,181
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1233
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,713
Whoooa....

1234
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:26,917
Hyah!

1235
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:28,517
Mine?

1236
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,790
Last l heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1237
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:33,263
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1238
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:47,646
ls he doing OK?

1239
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,169
ls he doing OK?

1240
00:57:48,213 --> 00:57:51,410
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r--

1241
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,317
lt's OK. l know who
you're talking about.

1242
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:03,658
Gill?

1243
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,860
Gill?

1244
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,562
Hey, Sharkbait.

1245
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:12,832
l'm sorry l couldn't stop the--

1246
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:15,032
No, l'm the one
who should be sorry.

1247
00:58:15,073 --> 00:58:17,701
l was so ready
to get out...

1248
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:20,507
so ready to taste that ocean...

1249
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:23,982
l was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1250
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:27,975
Nothing should be worth that.

1251
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,251
l'm sorry l couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1252
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,861
All right.
Hey, hey, hey--

1253
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:39,523
-What the--
-Aaah!

1254
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:43,296
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1255
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:45,428
Huh. Darn kids.

1256
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:48,462
Good thing l pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1257
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:50,065
NlGEL: Hey, psst!

1258
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:52,099
PEACH: Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1259
00:58:52,144 --> 00:58:54,772
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1260
00:58:54,813 --> 00:58:56,872
What am l talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1261
00:58:56,982 --> 00:58:59,246
-l've got to speak with him.
-What is it?

1262
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:01,377
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1263
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,048
-looking for you.
-My father? Really?

1264
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:08,219
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish--

1265
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,751
Sharks? That can't be him.

1266
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:13,390
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1267
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:15,593
-Tuna? Trout?
-Marlin?

1268
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,465
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1269
00:59:17,502 --> 00:59:20,096
lt's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1270
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:22,470
l heard he took on three.

1271
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:25,340
-Three sharks?
-That's 4,800 teeth!

1272
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,470
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1273
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:29,742
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1274
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,146
Really?

1275
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:32,980
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1276
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:35,077
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1277
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,384
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1278
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:40,255
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1279
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,920
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1280
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:45,327
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1281
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:48,561
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A.C...

1282
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,092
and the word is he's headed
this way right now...to Sydney!

1283
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:53,502
-Wow!
-What a good daddy!

1284
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:56,098
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1285
00:59:59,611 --> 01:00:01,238
GURGLE:
He's swimming to the filter!

1286
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,770
-Sharkbait!
-Not again!

1287
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:07,251
Sharkbait!

1288
01:00:07,286 --> 01:00:08,651
No!

1289
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:09,881
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1290
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:12,321
-We'll help you, kid!
-Get him out!

1291
01:00:16,628 --> 01:00:18,289
Get him out of there!

1292
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,957
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

1293
01:00:19,998 --> 01:00:22,592
Sharkbait!

1294
01:00:22,634 --> 01:00:24,659
-No!
-Can you hear me?

1295
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,193
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1296
01:00:26,238 --> 01:00:28,263
Yeah, l can hear you.

1297
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:30,241
Sharkbait, you did it!

1298
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:34,075
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

1299
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:36,181
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

1300
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:38,672
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1301
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:40,014
before Darla gets here.

1302
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:41,747
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1303
01:00:41,787 --> 01:00:44,620
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1304
01:00:44,656 --> 01:00:46,920
-Jacques? No cleaning.
-l shall resist.

1305
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,620
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1306
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:50,889
Think dirty thoughts.

1307
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,124
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1308
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:55,690
the dentist
will have to clean it.

1309
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:57,827
-Good work!
-Ha ha ha!

1310
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:06,901
All right, we're here, dudes!

1311
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:10,142
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1312
01:01:10,182 --> 01:01:11,672
MARLlN:
Where? l don't see it!

1313
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:14,151
DORY: Right there!
l see it! l see it!

1314
01:01:14,186 --> 01:01:17,314
MARLlN:
The swirling vortex of terror?

1315
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:19,654
-That's it, dude.
-Of course it is.

1316
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:23,718
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1317
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:26,253
Do you have your exit buddy?

1318
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:27,526
Yes!

1319
01:01:27,566 --> 01:01:32,299
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1320
01:01:32,337 --> 01:01:35,864
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1321
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:39,604
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1322
01:01:39,644 --> 01:01:42,579
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1323
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:45,879
Remember--
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1324
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:49,045
He's trying to speak to me,
l know it!

1325
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:52,318
You're really cute, but l don't
know what you're saying!

1326
01:01:52,357 --> 01:01:53,619
Say the first thing again.

1327
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:56,183
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1328
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:04,960
-Whoa!
-Wahoo!

1329
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:07,062
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1330
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:10,506
Whoo!

1331
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:13,136
That was...fun!

1332
01:02:13,178 --> 01:02:15,442
l actually enjoyed that.

1333
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,107
Hey, look, turtles!

1334
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:20,084
CRUSH: Ha ha!
Most excellent!

1335
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:21,881
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1336
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,117
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1337
01:02:25,157 --> 01:02:27,318
No worries, man!

1338
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,418
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1339
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:32,021
-Bye!
-Bye, Jellyman!

1340
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:34,361
You tell your little dude
l said hi, OK?

1341
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:35,559
SQUlRT:
See ya later, dudes!

1342
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,329
DORY: Bye, everyone!

1343
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:39,701
Nemo would have loved this.

1344
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:43,071
Ooh! Hey! Crush, l forgot!

1345
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:44,666
How old are you?

1346
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:48,907
CRUSH: 1 50, dude!
And still young! Rock on!

1347
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:52,974
150! 150!
l gotta remember that.

1348
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:54,212
Whoa.

1349
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:01,652
-We going in there?
-Yep.

1350
01:03:01,693 --> 01:03:03,752
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1351
01:03:03,795 --> 01:03:09,427
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1352
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:12,232
¶¶ Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming ¶¶

1353
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,430
Dory...

1354
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:24,842
MARLlN:
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1355
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:26,578
DORY:
How about we play a game?

1356
01:03:26,618 --> 01:03:27,880
MARLlN: OK.

1357
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:30,979
DORY: OK, l'm thinking
of something orange...

1358
01:03:31,022 --> 01:03:32,512
and it's small--

1359
01:03:32,557 --> 01:03:34,855
-lt's me.
-Right!

1360
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:38,454
lt's orange and small--

1361
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:39,794
lt's me.

1362
01:03:39,831 --> 01:03:41,731
All righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

1363
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:42,634
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

1364
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:44,932
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

1365
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,200
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1366
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:49,764
-That's just scary.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1367
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:51,639
l have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1368
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:53,200
That means
we've passed it before...

1369
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:54,610
and that means
we're going in circles...

1370
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:56,204
and that means
we're not going straight!

1371
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:58,407
-Hey, hey!
-Get to the surface.

1372
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,042
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1373
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,280
-Hey! Relax.
-What?

1374
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,914
Take a deep breath.

1375
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:07,359
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1376
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,156
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1377
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:11,219
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1378
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,629
-There's nobody here!
-There has to be someone.

1379
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:16,532
lt's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1380
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,900
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

1381
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:23,397
Nope. Nada.

1382
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:26,606
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse--

1383
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:28,476
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1384
01:04:28,513 --> 01:04:30,105
l'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1385
01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:32,514
lt's a fish we don't know.
lf we ask it directions...

1386
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:34,576
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1387
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:37,087
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1388
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:38,919
l don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1389
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:40,891
Let's play
the ''Let's Not Die'' card.

1390
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:42,826
-You want to get out of here?
-Of course l do.

1391
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:46,126
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1392
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:48,155
Dory, you don't
fully understand--

1393
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:50,190
Come on. Trust me on this.

1394
01:04:58,276 --> 01:05:02,113
All right.

1395
01:05:02,113 --> 01:05:05,378
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo!
Little fella?

1396
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:08,253
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1397
01:05:08,253 --> 01:05:09,345
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1398
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:11,412
Ha. Hello.

1399
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:12,980
-His son Bingo--
-Nemo.

1400
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:16,050
-Nemo was taken to--
-Sydney.

1401
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:19,291
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1402
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:21,265
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1403
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:23,392
so can you help us out?

1404
01:05:23,435 --> 01:05:26,962
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1405
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:30,236
Dory, l'm a little fella.

1406
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:33,778
l don't think
that's a little fella.

1407
01:05:33,778 --> 01:05:37,680
DORY: Oh! Big fella.
Whale. OK.

1408
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:40,184
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1409
01:05:40,218 --> 01:05:43,449
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1410
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:47,584
-Dory?
-Tooo fiind his son.

1411
01:05:47,626 --> 01:05:50,288
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1412
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:51,596
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1413
01:05:51,596 --> 01:05:53,723
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1414
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:56,097
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1415
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:59,729
-See, he's swimming away.
-Cooome baaack.

1416
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:02,035
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1417
01:06:02,073 --> 01:06:03,267
-Maybe a different dialect.

1418
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:06,505
-Moooohhhmmooo...
-Dory!

1419
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:09,809
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1420
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:10,148
-Maybe l should try humpback.
-Don't.

1421
01:06:10,148 --> 01:06:12,048
-Maybe l should try humpback.
-Don't.

1422
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:13,550
Wooooooo...

1423
01:06:13,585 --> 01:06:16,554
-You actually sound sick.
-Maybe louder?

1424
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:18,055
-Rah! Rah!
-Don't do that!

1425
01:06:18,089 --> 01:06:19,818
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1426
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:21,189
lt doesn't sound orca.

1427
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:23,023
lt sounds like nothing
l've ever heard.

1428
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:25,552
-Oooooo!
-Ohh!

1429
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:26,164
lt's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1430
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:27,529
lt's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1431
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:30,557
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1432
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:34,129
-KRlLL: Swim away!
-Oh, look, krill!

1433
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,169
-Aah!
-Aah!

1434
01:06:45,116 --> 01:06:47,880
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1435
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:51,878
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1436
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:54,915
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1437
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:56,984
Jacques,
l said no cleaning.

1438
01:06:57,095 --> 01:06:58,858
l am ashamed.

1439
01:06:58,897 --> 01:07:01,365
Look! Scum angel!

1440
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:05,535
Ooh! Aaah!

1441
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,504
Bubbles!
l love the bubbles!

1442
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:13,203
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1443
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:15,872
9:00 and cue dentist.

1444
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:18,178
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry l'm late.

1445
01:07:18,216 --> 01:07:20,912
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

1446
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:22,681
Little Davey Reynolds...

1447
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:24,313
PEACH: Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1448
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,448
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1449
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:28,516
Tastes pretty good to me.

1450
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,323
-Urrrp!
-Eww!

1451
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:33,228
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own--

1452
01:07:33,264 --> 01:07:34,356
Shh! Here he comes!

1453
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,367
NEMO: Aah!

1454
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:39,700
Crikey. What a state.

1455
01:07:41,172 --> 01:07:45,302
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1456
01:07:45,343 --> 01:07:48,278
-10:00, luv.
-Leave it open, would you?

1457
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:50,645
l've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1458
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:52,775
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1459
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:56,514
NEMO: Yay!
He's gonna clean the tank!

1460
01:07:56,554 --> 01:07:58,317
We're gonna be clean!

1461
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,017
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1462
01:08:00,058 --> 01:08:01,992
-Uh-huh.
-Of course you are.

1463
01:08:02,026 --> 01:08:04,654
l wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1464
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:05,263
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1465
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:07,925
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1466
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:10,332
Yeah.

1467
01:09:10,388 --> 01:09:13,516
Aaah!

1468
01:09:13,558 --> 01:09:16,391
Oof!

1469
01:09:21,566 --> 01:09:23,056
Whoo!

1470
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,295
Yaahhh!

1471
01:09:25,336 --> 01:09:27,065
DORY: Here comes the big one.

1472
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:29,629
Ooh! Come on!
You gotta try this!

1473
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:32,939
-Will you just stop it?
-Why? What's wrong?

1474
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:35,275
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1475
01:09:35,313 --> 01:09:36,473
-Whale?
-A whale!

1476
01:09:36,514 --> 01:09:39,244
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1477
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:42,047
Wow, a whale.
l speak whale.

1478
01:09:42,086 --> 01:09:44,418
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1479
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:47,652
l have to get out!
l have to find my son!

1480
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:53,096
l have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1481
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:58,299
Ohhh!

1482
01:09:59,704 --> 01:10:02,332
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1483
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:06,941
Hey...

1484
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:09,242
you OK?

1485
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,311
There, there.
lt's all right.

1486
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:20,290
lt'll be OK.

1487
01:10:20,324 --> 01:10:22,554
No. No, it won't.

1488
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,823
Sure it will. You'll see.

1489
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:30,994
No. l promised him l'd never
let anything happen to him.

1490
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:34,436
Huh. That's a funny thing
to promise.

1491
01:10:34,472 --> 01:10:35,837
What?

1492
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:38,307
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1493
01:10:38,342 --> 01:10:40,776
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1494
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:46,578
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1495
01:10:55,426 --> 01:10:57,257
-Hmm.
-What's going on?

1496
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,593
Don't know. l'll ask him.

1497
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:08,163
-Dory...
-Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1498
01:11:14,211 --> 01:11:15,803
l think he says we've stopped.

1499
01:11:15,846 --> 01:11:19,111
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1500
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,948
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1501
01:11:26,057 --> 01:11:28,855
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1502
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:33,853
The water's going down.
lt's going down!

1503
01:11:37,568 --> 01:11:39,001
Really? You sure about that?

1504
01:11:39,036 --> 01:11:41,095
Look!
Already it's half empty!

1505
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:42,901
l'd say it's half full.

1506
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,407
Stop that! lt's half empty!

1507
01:11:47,478 --> 01:11:50,675
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1508
01:11:50,715 --> 01:11:53,284
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1509
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:53,613
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1510
01:11:53,651 --> 01:11:55,812
or he wants a root beer float.

1511
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,480
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1512
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,455
That's eating us!

1513
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,459
How do l taste, Moby?
Do l taste good?

1514
01:12:02,493 --> 01:12:04,757
Tell him l'm not interested
in being lunch!

1515
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:07,263
-OK. Heee--
-Stop talking to him!

1516
01:12:10,568 --> 01:12:13,401
-Aah!
-Aah!

1517
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,597
What is going on?

1518
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,937
l'll check. Whaaat--

1519
01:12:16,974 --> 01:12:19,738
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1520
01:12:19,777 --> 01:12:22,109
-Yes, l can!
-No, you can't!

1521
01:12:22,146 --> 01:12:25,707
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1522
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,554
-OK.
-Dory! Oof!

1523
01:12:36,127 --> 01:12:39,722
He says it's time to let go.

1524
01:12:39,764 --> 01:12:41,732
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1525
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:43,427
How do you know?

1526
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:46,561
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1527
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:48,504
l don't!

1528
01:13:00,718 --> 01:13:04,021
-Aah!
-Aah!

1529
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:04,919
-Aah!
-Aah!

1530
01:13:04,955 --> 01:13:06,718
-Aah!
-Aah!

1531
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:13,893
Ha ha ha!
We're alive!

1532
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:17,832
Look! Sy-d-ney--Sydney!

1533
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:20,302
Sydney! Sydney again!

1534
01:13:22,306 --> 01:13:24,774
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1535
01:13:24,809 --> 01:13:27,744
We're gonna find my son!

1536
01:13:30,314 --> 01:13:30,748
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1537
01:13:30,748 --> 01:13:33,808
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1538
01:13:33,851 --> 01:13:36,319
Wow. l wish
l could speak whale.

1539
01:13:36,353 --> 01:13:38,651
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1540
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:41,783
-Right!
-We can do this!

1541
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:57,704
Morning.

1542
01:13:57,742 --> 01:14:01,007
lt's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1543
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:03,206
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1544
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:06,307
and we are getting out--
The tank is clean.

1545
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,910
The tank is clean!

1546
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:10,545
DEB: But how?

1547
01:14:10,588 --> 01:14:13,284
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1548
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,782
-What are we gonna do?
-What's it say, Peach?

1549
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,493
l can't hear you, Peach.

1550
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,964
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1551
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,967
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1552
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,993
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1553
01:14:27,037 --> 01:14:28,265
Stop it!

1554
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:29,795
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1555
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,138
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1556
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,871
Scan? What does that mean?

1557
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,344
Aah!

1558
01:14:38,749 --> 01:14:39,150
AQUASCUM:
Temperature--82 degrees...

1559
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,310
AQUASCUM:
Temperature--82 degrees...

1560
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,012
PH balance--normal.

1561
01:14:42,052 --> 01:14:44,452
-Ooh.

And he was 150 years old.

1835
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:13,343
-150?
-Yep.

1836
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:18,218
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1837
01:30:18,254 --> 01:30:19,812
Sandy Plankton?

1838
01:30:19,856 --> 01:30:21,847
Do you think l would
cross the entire ocean...

01:30:21,891 --> 01:30:23,984
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

-Ha ha ha!
-He was 150! Not 100!

1841
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:30,598
Who is this Sandy Plankton

Climb aboard, explorers.

1847
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:48,509
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1848
01:30:48,551 --> 01:30:51,418
''With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?''

1849
01:30:53,123 --> 01:30:55,353
