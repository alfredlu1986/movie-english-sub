1
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:46,073
<i>- before the end
of the season last year...</i>

2
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,035
<i>...and then re-injured it
in spring training...</i>

3
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:52,704
<i>...on a terrific game-saving play.</i>

4
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:54,915
<i>You know, I was talking with...</i>

5
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:58,960
- What time is this going on?
- 7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:02,172
- Who'd you say was pitching tonight?
- Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:06,385
- Goddamn Cuban, man. He can hurl it.
- I'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:09,596
- Who are they playing tonight, Yankees?
- Yankees.

9
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:13,934
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball coming
at you. You don't have time to think.

10
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,937
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

11
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:19,272
He's been hot lately.

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,653
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

13
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,751
Save.

14
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,169
The sewer.

15
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,679
Hold on, I'll get it.

16
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:55,475
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

17
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:59,312
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

18
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,736
Hey...

19
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:10,157
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

20
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:12,951
- What?
- Driving a car.

21
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,203
You know, just around the block.

22
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,164
Yeah?

23
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,834
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

24
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,754
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

25
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,799
Just around the block. Who said steal?

26
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,190
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

27
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:04,920
See, now it'll be there forever.

28
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,548
Me too.

29
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,761
Forever.

30
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:18,391
Let me ask you something.

31
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,024
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,151
Huh?

33
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,613
Come here.

34
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,408
Get over here.

35
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:49,923
Well, do you?

36
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:53,259
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

37
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:55,887
- No.
- No, what?

38
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,058
Sir.

39
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,936
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

40
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,816
A pack of punks, huh?

41
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:13,113
You live around here?

42
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,448
Right there.

43
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:21,329
You?

44
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:23,498
Right over there.

45
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,627
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

46
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,007
- Rester Street.
- Is your mother home?

47
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:44,811
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

48
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:54,487
Get in.

49
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:58,992
Get the fuck inside.

50
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:16,718
In.

51
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:24,476
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

52
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:34,027
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

53
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,724
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

54
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:06,851
The cop. He had a gold badge.

55
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:10,063
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

56
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,565
- No, no writing.
- He had a uniform on?

57
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,400
Like a regular police uniform?

58
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,736
- He was a cop.
- He took Davey.

59
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:20,907
- So, what were you guys doing?
- We wrote our names in the cement, but...

60
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:24,619
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

61
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:28,373
- That doesn't make sense. Come on.
- Is there something wrong, Dad?

62
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:49,602
Please.

63
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,688
No more.

64
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,607
Please.

65
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,111
No more, please.

66
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:29,809
- Have you seen him?
- Looks like damaged goods to me.

67
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,894
Jesus.

68
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:09,515
You took some good swings today.

69
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:12,101
Dad, I struck out.

70
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:15,897
Good swings, though.
That's what counts.

71
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:19,567
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

72
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:24,363
You're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

73
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:29,160
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

74
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,996
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

75
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,212
- Hey, see that gutter drain over there?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,508
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

77
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:47,011
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

78
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:50,640
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

79
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,768
If we could get that manhole cover up...

80
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,895
...could be 1000 balls down there.

81
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:59,232
Really? Let's try.

82
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:29,679
Get in.

83
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:32,682
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

84
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:37,937
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

85
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,494
Jimmy. Jimmy.

86
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,997
Earth to Mr. Markum.

87
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,750
- What do you want now, Pete?
- Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

88
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,795
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

89
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,839
- So?
- So that means less profit...

90
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:08,134
...and more profit means I get a raise.

91
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,844
So why don't you order more.

92
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:13,305
All right, but if the
Surgeon General calls, you're my alibi.

93
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,239
- Hey, you.
- Hey, there.

94
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,492
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

95
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,621
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

96
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:41,167
- Christ, I sound like...
- Someone's father?

97
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,669
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

98
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:49,175
- Later, Daddy.
- Later.

99
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:51,052
Have fun.

100
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:59,018
- Later.
- Later.

101
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:27,171
Brendan.

102
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:32,384
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

103
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:37,223
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

104
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,560
What will he do if he sees this?

105
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:45,272
Shoot you and then kill you.

106
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,112
It's been six hours.

107
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,740
I had to see you.

108
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,537
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

109
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,624
Tomorrow?

110
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,918
Like we planned?

111
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,546
Tomorrow.

112
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,802
Drop me around the corner.

113
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:49,128
- Take it easy.
- He kept cutting me off!

114
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:53,549
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

115
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:57,803
He followed me all the way from goddamn
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

116
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,930
That son of a bitch!

117
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,808
Can you believe this guy
keeps confessing?

118
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:07,146
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a
lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

119
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,983
Hey, Devine?

120
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:18,782
- What you looking at?
- The old neighborhood.

121
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:27,499
- We're done, Sean, but I can stick around.
- No, I think we're good, thanks.

122
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,794
A few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

123
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:35,924
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

124
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,302
Yeah.

125
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:43,182
- So the wife left you six months ago?
- So?

126
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:46,643
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs...

127
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,772
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

128
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:51,356
So, what's your point?

129
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:55,235
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

130
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:57,905
She wants to worship
at the temple of Devine.

131
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:01,200
- I'm married, Whitey.
- So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

132
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,952
You haven't talked to Lauren
in six months.

133
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,579
She calls all the time.

134
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:08,874
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

135
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,920
One of these days, the phone's gonna ring
and she'll tell me why she left.

136
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:16,381
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

137
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,445
Come on, come on, come on.

138
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,075
<i>The pitch. A swing and a line drive
into right field. A base hit.</i>

139
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:46,411
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

140
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:57,339
Could we please have three beers?

141
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,223
Yeah, come on.

142
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,197
You believe those chicks?

143
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:27,703
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

144
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,500
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

145
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:37,212
- We've got you right over here, boys.
- Yeah.

146
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,172
Yeah.

147
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,135
I've known her since she was a kid.

148
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:55,480
<i>A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.</i>

149
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:06,033
Dave.

150
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,119
It's 3 in the morning.

151
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:10,537
Where have you been?

152
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,334
Oh, my God.

153
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:18,045
I fucked up.

154
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,172
What happened?

155
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:25,177
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

156
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:29,139
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

157
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:32,684
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

158
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:36,688
- It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God, Dave.

159
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:40,150
Come on. Come here.

160
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:46,448
So I'm walking to my car, and this guy
comes up to me and asks for a light.

161
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:49,826
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

162
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:53,580
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

163
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,208
- Oh, God.
- That's when I see the knife.

164
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:59,503
Says, "Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them."

165
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,213
- That's what he said?
- Yeah.

166
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,716
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

167
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:09,679
- You said you swung on him first.
- Jesus, can I tell the fucking story?

168
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,599
I'm sorry, babe.

169
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:18,980
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I...

170
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,068
I went off.

171
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,738
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

172
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:30,408
There was blood everywhere.

173
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,871
I might have killed him.

174
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:38,750
Killed him?

175
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,094
It makes you feel...

176
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,638
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

177
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah, but you had to, right?

178
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:59,604
It makes you feel...

179
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:02,274
...alien.

180
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:11,741
Okay.

181
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,744
Babe, you hop in the shower.

182
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,498
And I'll take care of your clothes.

183
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,836
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

184
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:24,838
Here.

185
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:40,145
<i>911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

186
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:43,815
<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,
and the door's open.</i>

187
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:46,735
<i>- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.</i>

188
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:50,822
<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.</i>

189
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,658
<i>- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.</i>

190
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:55,368
<i>Your name, what's your name?</i>

191
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,163
<i>We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.</i>

192
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,594
<i>Dispatch, this is Unit 33.</i>

193
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:17,849
<i>We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.</i>

194
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:21,895
<i>Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.</i>

195
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:26,024
<i>No, but by the looks of this car,
we'll find one sooner or later.</i>

196
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,623
- Yeah?
- I'm in the weeds here at the store...

197
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,166
...and I need some help.

198
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,087
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

199
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:50,924
- That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
- Hold on.

200
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,976
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

201
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:05,897
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

202
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:08,733
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

203
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,276
She'll be there.

204
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:13,071
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

205
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:16,449
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

206
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,785
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

207
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,914
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

208
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,083
What the fuck's going on here?

209
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:37,595
- Pete, anybody show?
- No.

210
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:39,764
Katie didn't call?

211
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,683
No.

212
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,320
<i>- Hello?
- Drew, Jimmy.</i>

213
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,614
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

214
00:20:57,198 --> 00:21:00,743
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

215
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,957
Have a nice day.

216
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:09,210
<i>No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.</i>

217
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:13,423
<i>Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.</i>

218
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,300
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

219
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:19,304
<i>- She seeing anybody maybe?
- 19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?</i>

220
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,682
<i>- That's the cold truth, bud.
- I'll talk to you later.</i>

221
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:32,817
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

222
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:36,821
- Mind if I go grab a smoke?
- You can smoke the whole pack.

223
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,502
Can I help you, Brendan?

224
00:21:52,462 --> 00:21:55,923
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

225
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,385
- That's Barry's. Next aisle.
- Thanks.

226
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:15,902
- When's Sal getting here?
- Anytime now.

227
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,030
<i>- That it, Bren?
- A Globe.</i>

228
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:23,159
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

229
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:26,371
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

230
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,457
No, I just see her here sometimes.

231
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,418
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

232
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,339
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

233
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:50,937
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

234
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:53,564
Shoot.

235
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,900
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

236
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:00,405
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

237
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,741
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

238
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:07,995
He's nice. Does sign language with his
brother even though he doesn't have to.

239
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:10,081
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

240
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:13,418
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

241
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,254
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

242
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:19,632
- No. Really?
- Straight up.

243
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,347
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

244
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:43,114
- Hey, there, bad boy.
- Sarge.

245
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:48,035
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

246
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:50,580
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

247
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:55,626
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

248
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,086
Let's go find out.

249
00:23:57,253 --> 00:23:59,672
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER
on his own...

250
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:05,636
He asks the nurse, "Hey, where they
keep the Coke machine?"

251
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:09,182
- Did she tell him?
- Tom, what do we got on the car so far?

252
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:13,019
We found the registration in the
glove box. Owner is Katherine Markum.

253
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,729
- Oh, shit.
- You know her?

254
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,481
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

255
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:21,360
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

256
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:25,489
- Oh, fuck, that's her.
- Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

257
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:29,994
When we were kids. Now it's just
a "hello" around the neighborhood.

258
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,998
Nineteen.

259
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:35,958
Fuck, man.

260
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,711
He's in for a world of hurt.

261
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:08,491
Do not make her laugh.

262
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,626
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

263
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:23,089
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

264
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:27,551
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

265
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:29,762
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

266
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:32,890
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

267
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:36,060
...hits her in the shoulder,
maybe the bicep.

268
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:39,438
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds...

269
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:44,318
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I dig that.

270
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:47,530
Body of Christ.

271
00:25:48,572 --> 00:25:50,866
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

272
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:55,162
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

273
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,919
Body of Christ.

274
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,089
Body of Christ.

275
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,592
Body of Christ.

276
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:13,681
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

277
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:15,307
The killer shows, she bolts.

278
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:19,061
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

279
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:22,481
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

280
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,615
Body of Christ.

281
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,036
Body of Christ.

282
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:49,592
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

283
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:53,804
No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

284
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,640
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

285
00:26:56,974 --> 00:27:00,769
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

286
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,479
This dress itches.

287
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:06,317
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

288
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:08,819
We are so proud of you.

289
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:30,174
Morning, honey.

290
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:34,511
Dave, there's nothing about it
in the papers. I checked three times.

291
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:37,848
It was late, real late.

292
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:42,228
- Morning, Mikey.
- Morning, Dad.

293
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:47,024
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

294
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:50,361
Come on.

295
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:55,366
Put your coat on, Mike.

296
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:57,660
Thanks, Mom.

297
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:11,340
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

298
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:14,218
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

299
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:18,597
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

300
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,558
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

301
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:24,269
Just curious, I guess.

302
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,741
That's my daughter's car.

303
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,871
That's my daughter's car.

304
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:48,460
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

305
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,379
- Want to take a walk over?
- Yeah.

306
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:52,715
<i>- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

307
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:55,217
<i>We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.</i>

308
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,844
Oh, shit.

309
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,555
<i>- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.</i>

310
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,599
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

311
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:06,270
<i>Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.</i>

312
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:08,188
<i>And he's got some guys with him.</i>

313
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:11,650
<i>- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.</i>

314
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:16,321
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

315
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,323
All right, I'm on my way.

316
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:24,788
- Hey, guys.
- That's our niece in there.

317
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,623
- Let us in.
- We're doing our job.

318
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,083
- Let us in.
- Fuck you!

319
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,960
The doughnut shop's that way!

320
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:32,921
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

321
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,132
- Enough.
- Nick.

322
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,470
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

323
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:42,222
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

324
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:46,018
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

325
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,312
- But get answers.
- You got it.

326
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,694
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

327
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:59,865
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

328
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,659
- Is she in there?
- All we're doing is looking.

329
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:06,455
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

330
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:09,708
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

331
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:14,171
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

332
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:19,009
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

333
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,428
<i>- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.</i>

334
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:24,556
<i>Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.</i>

335
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:28,518
<i>- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.</i>

336
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:30,520
All right.

337
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:32,689
Make sure he doesn't get through.

338
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,317
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

339
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:39,446
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

340
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:41,406
Go.

341
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:49,289
<i>There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.</i>

342
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:52,125
<i>All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...</i>

343
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:55,212
<i>...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.</i>

344
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:59,716
<i>Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...</i>

345
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:03,220
<i>...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.</i>

346
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:06,682
<i>We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.</i>

347
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:12,229
<i>Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.</i>

348
00:31:12,813 --> 00:31:15,107
Ready? Bat back.

349
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,987
All the way back.

350
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,709
I never saw anything like that before.

351
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:36,253
What do we got?

352
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,931
Oh, Christ.

353
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,910
Is that her?

354
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,165
Yeah.

355
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,419
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

356
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,005
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

357
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,049
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

358
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:27,637
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.

359
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:31,308
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

360
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,518
"Hey, Jimmy...

361
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,689
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect."

362
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:42,819
- Hey.
- Hold on!

363
00:32:42,986 --> 00:32:47,282
- Grab him. Stop that guy.
- Hey, you!

364
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,701
- I'm fucking going in there!
- Take it easy!

365
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,204
- Get his arms.
- Hold him. Come on.

366
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,706
- Let me in, you motherfuckers!
- Take it easy.

367
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,794
- Let me in!
- Is she in there?!

368
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:04,841
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

369
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:08,512
Is my daughter in there?! Is she in there?!
Is she in there?!

370
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:10,889
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

371
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:14,518
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

372
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:17,687
Is that my daughter in there?!

373
00:33:17,854 --> 00:33:21,024
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

374
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:25,737
- Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

375
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:28,698
Is that my daughter in there?

376
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,244
No! No!

377
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,541
Oh, no!

378
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:40,210
No, God!

379
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:43,797
Oh, God, no!

380
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,260
No one's said anything, right?

381
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:32,095
What do you mean?

382
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:36,808
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

383
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,935
Jimmy?

384
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:40,729
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

385
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:44,607
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

386
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,233
That's her.

387
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:30,779
That's Katie.

388
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,365
That's my daughter.

389
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:56,471
Fresh-brewed.

390
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:59,098
So we need to work a time line.

391
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:01,601
It's details, little things
that make a case.

392
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:05,522
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

393
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:11,444
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

394
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:14,531
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

395
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,784
At the last minute, she changed her mind.

396
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:21,162
See what I mean?

397
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:23,873
What do you mean, Jimmy?

398
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,546
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

399
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,589
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

400
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:37,053
If I'd gotten into that car that day,
my life would have been a different thing.

401
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:41,057
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

402
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,185
...she was a beautiful woman.

403
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,604
Regal.

404
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,024
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

405
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,694
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

406
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,031
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

407
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,951
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

408
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,912
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

409
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,124
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

410
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,460
And Katie never would have been born.

411
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,755
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

412
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:23,057
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

413
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,023
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

414
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:31,691
Around 7:30.

415
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,819
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

416
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:41,617
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

417
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:44,829
She was having dinner with her friends.

418
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,294
- Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

419
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:55,298
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

420
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:58,968
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

421
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:01,512
And then around 8, she left.

422
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,807
- Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

423
00:38:04,974 --> 00:38:08,728
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

424
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:11,147
- No, go ahead.
- Good.

425
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:15,693
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

426
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:18,946
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

427
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:22,158
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

428
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:25,578
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

429
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,538
She what?

430
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,833
It's nothing.

431
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:34,170
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

432
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:38,424
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

433
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:42,261
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

434
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:45,681
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

435
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:50,061
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

436
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:54,190
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

437
00:38:54,357 --> 00:38:57,026
- Okay.
- It was just a look.

438
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:02,406
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

439
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,866
You were in prison?

440
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,326
- Oh, Jesus.
- Here we go.

441
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,829
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

442
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:12,208
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

443
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,211
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

444
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:19,215
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

445
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:22,677
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

446
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:25,137
Okay, Mr. Markum.

447
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:28,808
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

448
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:33,437
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

449
00:39:40,736 --> 00:39:42,822
There was this kid.

450
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,449
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

451
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,743
What? Remember, it's the little things.

452
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:52,331
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

453
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:55,293
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

454
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,253
- No.
- What makes you so sure?

455
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,964
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

456
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,925
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

457
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,387
No one right now, as far as we know.

458
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:09,640
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you what you need tomorrow.

459
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,102
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

460
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:17,898
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

461
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:22,403
And if you think of anything...

462
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,240
...anything at all, give us a call.

463
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,540
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

464
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:38,627
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

465
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:40,671
This car came up and took Dave away.

466
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,674
- Abduction?
- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

467
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,095
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

468
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:50,097
- They catch these guys?
- One died.

469
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:53,142
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

470
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:57,313
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

471
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,649
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

472
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:03,569
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

473
00:41:03,736 --> 00:41:08,115
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

474
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:18,167
Cause of death: gunshot wound to the
head, not the trauma from the beating.

475
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:22,505
- What else?
- Her and her friends were barhopping.

476
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:25,716
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

477
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,511
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

478
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:31,680
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

479
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:34,141
It doesn't sound like much.

480
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:36,519
What do you say, Devine?

481
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,939
We'll get the guy, sir.

482
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:44,235
That's right. All right, let's do it.

483
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:53,035
- That's the best you can come up with?
- It made him happy, didn't it?

484
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:57,164
This is Sean.

485
00:41:57,957 --> 00:42:01,335
- Hello?
- Is it Lauren?

486
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,924
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

487
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,095
Is he with you?

488
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:19,812
Is that the baby?

489
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,357
Lauren, at least tell me her name.

490
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,870
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

491
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,427
Hey.

492
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,224
Would it surprise you?

493
00:42:57,391 --> 00:42:59,310
Wouldn't be the first time.

494
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:05,441
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that...?

495
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:07,610
Did you see her?

496
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:11,113
- I heard a car hit something.
- Hit what? Another car?

497
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,158
- Oh, no, not loud like that.
- Like hitting the curb?

498
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,201
Yes, maybe.

499
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:19,330
Then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi."

500
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,624
- Someone said, "Hi"?
- "Hi."

501
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,294
Then there was a loud crack.

502
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:29,173
- Could it have been a gunshot?
- Yes, maybe.

503
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,718
- Did you look out your window?
- Oh, no.

504
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:35,846
I was in my dressing gown by then.

505
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:39,475
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

506
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:42,311
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

507
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,938
Female.

508
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:46,482
I think.

509
00:43:47,316 --> 00:43:50,402
- It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
- Yeah.

510
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:52,821
Sorry to trouble you.

511
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:03,290
- Jimmy.
- Theo.

512
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:05,793
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

513
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:07,961
- She's trying.
- Let's get these on ice.

514
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:10,506
You got a couple of coolers?

515
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,680
Right here's fine.

516
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:27,231
So how are you handling all this so far?

517
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,359
- It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
- Yeah?

518
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:32,945
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

519
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:36,865
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

520
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:40,828
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

521
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:44,706
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

522
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:48,710
Domestic responsibilities?

523
00:44:48,877 --> 00:44:54,174
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

524
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,344
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

525
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:00,097
It just needed to be said, that's all.

526
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:04,351
You'll come through
because you're a man.

527
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,687
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

528
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:10,107
I said, "You got yourself
a real old-school man there."

529
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,901
- Like they put her in a bag.
- What?

530
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:16,280
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

531
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:20,409
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

532
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,246
- Well...
- Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

533
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:27,583
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

534
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:32,629
- You don't need to talk about Janey.
- My daughter was murdered.

535
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,466
They put a gun to her. As we stand here,
she's on an autopsy slab...

536
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,428
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

537
00:45:39,595 --> 00:45:43,265
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

538
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:49,313
Good to see you, Theo.

539
00:45:53,442 --> 00:45:56,945
Eve, just tell them what they
want to know.

540
00:45:57,112 --> 00:46:00,073
- Who was she dating?
- We already told the Savages.

541
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,993
- The Savage brothers?
- They were here yesterday.

542
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,538
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

543
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:08,999
No one special.

544
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:15,631
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

545
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:18,759
- What?
- She was leaving town, wasn't she?

546
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:22,304
- Going to Las Vegas?
- How do you know?

547
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:27,309
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

548
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:31,480
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

549
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:35,150
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

550
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,195
So who was she going with?

551
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:42,449
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

552
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:44,618
Brendan.

553
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:46,995
Excuse me?

554
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:50,540
- Brendan.
- Brendan Harris?

555
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:53,168
Brendan Harris, yeah.

556
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,170
You got an address?

557
00:47:08,684 --> 00:47:10,644
Hey, Dave.

558
00:47:14,523 --> 00:47:16,441
Hey, Jimmy.

559
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:20,070
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

560
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,782
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

561
00:47:29,371 --> 00:47:32,374
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

562
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,210
How you doing?

563
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,546
How you doing?

564
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,966
What happened to your hand?

565
00:47:41,883 --> 00:47:43,468
This?

566
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:48,723
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

567
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:52,561
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

568
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:56,565
It's good to see you.

569
00:47:57,357 --> 00:47:58,692
Yeah?

570
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:06,908
How are our girls holding up?

571
00:48:07,075 --> 00:48:09,202
They're doing okay, I guess.

572
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:12,706
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

573
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:28,388
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

574
00:48:30,682 --> 00:48:31,975
Yeah.

575
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:40,942
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food...

576
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:44,070
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

577
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:47,574
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

578
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,205
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

579
00:48:53,788 --> 00:48:58,293
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

580
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:07,969
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

581
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,264
...that girl was neat.

582
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:16,186
When I got out of the joint...

583
00:49:17,562 --> 00:49:20,482
...you know, after Marita died...

584
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:26,988
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

585
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:30,825
...than I ever was of being in prison.

586
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,503
I loved her...

587
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:44,714
...most...

588
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,887
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

589
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:59,896
...it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

590
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:02,691
Unwanted.

591
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:09,155
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

592
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:13,410
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

593
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:20,166
Jimmy.

594
00:50:24,295 --> 00:50:26,172
You're crying now.

595
00:50:29,384 --> 00:50:31,553
Yeah, damn.

596
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,561
I just want to hug her one more time.

597
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,985
She was 19 fucking years old.

598
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,244
Do you want me to leave you alone?

599
00:50:57,245 --> 00:50:59,789
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

600
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,586
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

601
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:24,230
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

602
00:51:24,522 --> 00:51:27,984
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

603
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:34,949
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

604
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,455
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

605
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:42,749
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

606
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:45,293
It was about 8.

607
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:51,299
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

608
00:51:51,633 --> 00:51:54,969
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

609
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:58,181
I don't know.

610
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:03,811
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

611
00:52:03,978 --> 00:52:07,899
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

612
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:12,362
- He's not a thief.
- He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

613
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:16,699
Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

614
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,996
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

615
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:26,167
We were gonna leave Sunday.

616
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:30,296
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

617
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:34,884
Well, that was the plan, right?

618
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:38,054
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

619
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:41,349
- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

620
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:52,527
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

621
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:55,071
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

622
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,031
He don't speak.

623
00:52:57,198 --> 00:53:01,536
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

624
00:53:01,703 --> 00:53:05,832
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

625
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:11,337
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 A.M. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

626
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:13,423
I was asleep.

627
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:15,383
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

628
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:22,348
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

629
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:25,309
He came down for breakfast at 9.

630
00:53:26,144 --> 00:53:30,773
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

631
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,111
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

632
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,324
I loved her so much.

633
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,121
I'm never gonna feel that again.

634
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:48,082
It doesn't happen twice.

635
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:52,545
Doesn't happen once most times.

636
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:55,923
Celeste.

637
00:53:57,049 --> 00:54:01,095
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

638
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:05,558
I don't know.

639
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,353
I don't know, I just...

640
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:12,398
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

641
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:15,276
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

642
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:18,446
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:26,078
One for the road and then home.

644
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:35,129
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

645
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:37,131
You've done enough.

646
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,638
To you and Dave for being here for this.

647
00:55:00,821 --> 00:55:04,158
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

648
00:55:05,493 --> 00:55:08,412
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

649
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,248
Good night.

650
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,834
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

651
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:34,939
Hello?

652
00:55:38,693 --> 00:55:41,737
Christ. Lauren, say something.

653
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,705
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

654
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,167
<i>Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things
made sense.</i>

655
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:57,586
<i>I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...</i>

656
00:55:57,753 --> 00:56:00,506
<i>...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.</i>

657
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:06,137
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

658
00:56:06,303 --> 00:56:08,347
The dead are still dead.

659
00:56:10,975 --> 00:56:13,310
Jesus, I...

660
00:56:13,477 --> 00:56:15,604
...can't do this tonight.

661
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:17,690
I just...

662
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,526
I can't do it.

663
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:22,695
Bye, baby.

664
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:34,999
Because...

665
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,628
...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

666
00:56:39,837 --> 00:56:41,547
He was the boy.

667
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,509
The boy who escaped from wolves.

668
00:56:46,594 --> 00:56:49,180
An animal of the dusk.

669
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,348
Invisible.

670
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:53,642
Silent.

671
00:56:54,226 --> 00:56:56,312
Living in a world...

672
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,898
...the others never saw.

673
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:03,277
World of fireflies.

674
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:09,325
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

675
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:14,455
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

676
00:57:26,008 --> 00:57:30,846
I just gotta get my head right.

677
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:37,019
Catch a nice, long sleep.

678
00:57:37,478 --> 00:57:40,481
And the boy will go back to his forest.

679
00:57:42,566 --> 00:57:45,653
Back to his fireflies.

680
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:54,662
Is he asleep?

681
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:18,686
How's Jimmy and everybody?

682
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,480
Okay.

683
00:58:21,772 --> 00:58:23,524
It's weird.

684
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:27,903
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

685
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,531
Dave? Dave.

686
00:58:33,784 --> 00:58:35,744
There's still nothing in the paper.

687
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:38,122
About what?

688
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:40,332
About what?

689
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:47,298
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

690
00:58:47,715 --> 00:58:50,342
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

691
00:58:53,387 --> 00:58:55,055
Yeah.

692
00:58:55,222 --> 00:58:56,765
Right.

693
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:01,687
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

694
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:05,065
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

695
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:08,944
That seems more important right now.

696
00:59:38,098 --> 00:59:41,935
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

697
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:45,439
But I don't know how.

698
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,127
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

699
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:09,963
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

700
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,465
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

701
01:00:11,632 --> 01:00:15,636
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

702
01:00:15,803 --> 01:00:18,472
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

703
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,391
Considering the crime, maybe.

704
01:00:21,642 --> 01:00:22,976
Dave Boyle?

705
01:00:23,143 --> 01:00:26,605
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

706
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,315
Could be.

707
01:00:28,482 --> 01:00:31,985
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

708
01:00:32,152 --> 01:00:35,864
- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

709
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,752
Hey, Boyle!

710
01:00:49,503 --> 01:00:51,880
- What's it been, seven, eight years?
- Yeah.

711
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:53,549
Yeah. How you doing?

712
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,175
This is my son, Michael.

713
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:57,719
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

714
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:00,764
I'm an old buddy of your dad's.
Hi.

715
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:04,685
- So you still with the staties?
- Homicide. This is my partner.

716
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:07,563
- Sergeant Powers. How are you?
- So you got a minute?

717
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:12,025
- We'd love to ask some quick questions.
- I was just gonna walk Michael to school.

718
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:16,113
- I can be back in a few minutes.
- Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

719
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,781
Sure.

720
01:01:19,366 --> 01:01:21,159
So you look good.

721
01:01:21,702 --> 01:01:24,705
- I hear rents are rising.
- Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

722
01:01:24,871 --> 01:01:27,499
They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

723
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,459
We walked by there the other day.

724
01:01:29,626 --> 01:01:31,878
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

725
01:01:32,045 --> 01:01:34,464
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

726
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:39,094
"Neighborhood needs a crime wave.
Get property values where they belong."

727
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:43,765
Girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.

728
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:46,435
Dave. Call me Dave.

729
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:48,562
You said the F-word, Dad.

730
01:01:48,937 --> 01:01:51,732
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

731
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:55,068
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

732
01:01:55,235 --> 01:01:59,239
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

733
01:01:59,406 --> 01:02:02,326
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

734
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,619
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

735
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:09,041
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

736
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:12,586
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

737
01:02:13,378 --> 01:02:17,799
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

738
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:19,968
That's what we wanted to talk about.

739
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:24,097
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

740
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:26,558
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

741
01:02:26,725 --> 01:02:30,270
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

742
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:33,482
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

743
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:35,233
What time did they leave?

744
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,445
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

745
01:02:38,612 --> 01:02:41,740
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

746
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:45,410
You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

747
01:02:45,577 --> 01:02:47,245
Michael.

748
01:02:47,746 --> 01:02:49,456
Like what?
I don't know.

749
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:50,957
A guy watching the girls?

750
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:53,960
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

751
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:59,966
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

752
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:03,470
- See you later, Dad.
- You got your milk money?

753
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:12,479
Fuck, I hated school.

754
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,523
What?

755
01:03:15,941 --> 01:03:19,027
Yeah, me too, Sean.

756
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:24,699
Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

757
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:27,994
- Home.
- Home by 1: 15, would you say?

758
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:30,956
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

759
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:35,710
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

760
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:39,339
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
- All right.

761
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:47,597
What?

762
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:50,350
What happened to him in that car?

763
01:03:57,691 --> 01:03:59,526
Can you believe this?

764
01:03:59,693 --> 01:04:03,697
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

765
01:04:05,282 --> 01:04:08,743
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

766
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,829
...you're not left with a whole lot.

767
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:13,582
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

768
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:17,961
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

769
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:20,088
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

770
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:23,508
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

771
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:28,305
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

772
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:32,350
- She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

773
01:04:32,517 --> 01:04:35,186
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

774
01:04:35,353 --> 01:04:37,981
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

775
01:04:38,148 --> 01:04:41,401
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

776
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:45,864
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

777
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:49,576
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

778
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:52,954
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

779
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:55,832
- We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

780
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:58,835
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

781
01:04:59,002 --> 01:05:01,129
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

782
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:04,966
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

783
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:07,302
Just a little one.

784
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:16,561
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

785
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:18,897
- Sure.
- Good.

786
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,236
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

787
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,905
Good.

788
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:34,204
And the notice?

789
01:05:35,038 --> 01:05:36,414
Notice?

790
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,670
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

791
01:05:42,837 --> 01:05:45,423
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

792
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:47,300
Where's my daughter?

793
01:05:49,803 --> 01:05:51,846
Downstairs, in the basement.

794
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,973
I wanna see her.

795
01:06:41,354 --> 01:06:43,690
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

796
01:06:45,108 --> 01:06:48,194
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

797
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:51,197
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

798
01:06:55,118 --> 01:06:57,704
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

799
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:03,084
The notice.

800
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:06,754
It should read: "Katherine Markum...

801
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:11,926
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

802
01:07:12,677 --> 01:07:16,931
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to..."

803
01:07:17,265 --> 01:07:20,727
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

804
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,146
- You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

805
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:08,399
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

806
01:08:08,566 --> 01:08:11,319
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

807
01:08:11,486 --> 01:08:14,489
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

808
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:19,285
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm
gonna go get some. See you in a minute.

809
01:08:19,452 --> 01:08:23,289
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

810
01:08:24,957 --> 01:08:29,754
Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck
my hand in, it started again.

811
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:31,631
- Stupid.
- Painful.

812
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:38,304
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

813
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:42,475
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

814
01:08:56,072 --> 01:08:59,117
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

815
01:09:00,493 --> 01:09:04,831
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

816
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,543
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

817
01:09:13,756 --> 01:09:16,884
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

818
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:19,720
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

819
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:21,055
- Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

820
01:09:21,222 --> 01:09:22,682
Yeah.

821
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:26,269
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

822
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:29,480
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

823
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:31,149
Look, I gotta go.

824
01:09:34,026 --> 01:09:37,738
Oh, damn it.
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

825
01:09:37,905 --> 01:09:40,491
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

826
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:42,785
Come on.

827
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:51,377
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

828
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:54,338
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

829
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:56,132
- What?
- It's a little thing.

830
01:09:56,299 --> 01:10:00,052
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

831
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:02,263
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

832
01:10:03,848 --> 01:10:06,017
You think Dave killed Katie?

833
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:09,729
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

834
01:10:12,148 --> 01:10:15,568
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

835
01:10:15,735 --> 01:10:19,322
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

836
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:22,658
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

837
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:26,287
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

838
01:10:26,746 --> 01:10:28,247
I was asleep.

839
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:36,130
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

840
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:38,633
Okay. Well, thanks.

841
01:10:49,352 --> 01:10:51,103
Bullshit.

842
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,772
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

843
01:10:52,939 --> 01:10:56,609
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

844
01:10:56,776 --> 01:10:58,486
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

845
01:10:59,028 --> 01:11:00,279
Remember what you said?

846
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,284
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

847
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:10,748
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

848
01:11:10,915 --> 01:11:12,500
You're 100 percent sure?

849
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:17,463
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

850
01:11:20,466 --> 01:11:23,386
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

851
01:11:23,552 --> 01:11:25,971
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

852
01:11:26,138 --> 01:11:29,809
He said Katie told him you'd disown her
if she ever dated a Harris.

853
01:11:31,477 --> 01:11:34,647
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

854
01:11:34,814 --> 01:11:36,148
Why is that?

855
01:11:38,192 --> 01:11:40,820
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

856
01:11:40,986 --> 01:11:45,157
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

857
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,328
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

858
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:52,331
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

859
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:58,003
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

860
01:11:58,421 --> 01:12:00,172
I don't know.

861
01:12:00,506 --> 01:12:03,342
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

862
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:08,681
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

863
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,644
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

864
01:12:13,811 --> 01:12:16,355
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

865
01:12:16,522 --> 01:12:18,691
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

866
01:12:18,858 --> 01:12:22,862
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

867
01:12:23,028 --> 01:12:26,532
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

868
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:29,994
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

869
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:33,914
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

870
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:36,584
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

871
01:12:37,334 --> 01:12:39,753
- How long?
- How long what?

872
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:42,548
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

873
01:12:42,715 --> 01:12:44,049
You bargaining with us?

874
01:12:45,885 --> 01:12:47,178
Bargaining?

875
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:50,723
You giving us a deadline?

876
01:12:53,726 --> 01:12:57,563
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

877
01:12:58,814 --> 01:13:03,319
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

878
01:13:07,114 --> 01:13:11,076
The last thing we need is Markum
and the Savages putting the fear of God...

879
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:14,288
...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of those brothers.

880
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:18,083
Eleven months apart, like their mother ran
a loose-cannon factory.

881
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,711
Fucking knuckleheads.

882
01:13:23,756 --> 01:13:25,841
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

883
01:13:26,008 --> 01:13:29,386
- Yeah, you got a match?
- You're gonna love it.

884
01:13:30,554 --> 01:13:33,933
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.

885
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:38,395
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

886
01:13:38,562 --> 01:13:43,692
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

887
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:45,235
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

888
01:13:45,402 --> 01:13:50,032
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

889
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:54,286
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

890
01:13:54,453 --> 01:13:58,082
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

891
01:13:58,248 --> 01:14:00,417
Thought you'd like that.

892
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:32,032
It's okay, Ray.

893
01:14:32,825 --> 01:14:34,660
Don't worry about it.

894
01:14:48,674 --> 01:14:50,008
Ma said that?

895
01:14:52,594 --> 01:14:53,846
That I'm better off?

896
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:02,688
I loved her!
You know what that's like?

897
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:04,356
Huh?

898
01:15:09,528 --> 01:15:11,363
I'm sorry.

899
01:15:19,455 --> 01:15:21,290
No, you're wrong.

900
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,710
I won't ever feel that again.

901
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:30,674
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

902
01:15:30,841 --> 01:15:34,720
- Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

903
01:15:34,887 --> 01:15:37,431
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

904
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:41,477
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

905
01:15:43,812 --> 01:15:46,356
That's the storeroom.

906
01:15:47,357 --> 01:15:51,069
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

907
01:15:51,361 --> 01:15:53,572
I always keep that door locked.

908
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:57,242
So they must have had a key.

909
01:15:57,409 --> 01:16:01,413
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

910
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:05,876
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

911
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:10,756
The only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known...

912
01:16:11,173 --> 01:16:12,925
...I kept this under the counter.

913
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:16,720
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

914
01:16:17,638 --> 01:16:20,182
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

915
01:16:20,349 --> 01:16:22,935
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

916
01:16:23,101 --> 01:16:26,188
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

917
01:16:26,355 --> 01:16:31,276
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

918
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:32,945
Oh, yeah?

919
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:35,822
This guy I fired a couple
of weeks before.

920
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:39,910
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

921
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:44,289
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

922
01:16:44,456 --> 01:16:46,541
And I just knew.

923
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:49,461
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

924
01:16:50,128 --> 01:16:51,964
You remember his name?

925
01:16:52,965 --> 01:16:54,925
Do I look senile to you?

926
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,594
- No, sir.
- Name...

927
01:16:57,803 --> 01:16:59,805
...was Ray Harris.

928
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:03,225
We used to call him "Just Ray."

929
01:17:05,978 --> 01:17:09,022
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

930
01:17:10,023 --> 01:17:13,735
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

931
01:17:25,664 --> 01:17:27,541
Where you been?

932
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,544
Out.

933
01:17:33,797 --> 01:17:35,799
What you watching?

934
01:17:35,966 --> 01:17:38,051
Some vampire movie.

935
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,346
Guy just got his head torn off.

936
01:17:43,098 --> 01:17:45,267
Where'd you go, Celeste?

937
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:51,857
I was sitting in my car...

938
01:17:52,315 --> 01:17:55,485
...down by the channel.
You know...

939
01:17:56,111 --> 01:17:57,529
...thinking about things.

940
01:17:59,364 --> 01:18:02,743
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

941
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,163
No, actually, I don't know.

942
01:18:11,877 --> 01:18:15,213
Things. You know, the day.

943
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,676
About Katie being dead.

944
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,096
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

945
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:25,682
...those things.

946
01:18:26,057 --> 01:18:28,059
Those things.

947
01:18:28,852 --> 01:18:31,271
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

948
01:18:32,898 --> 01:18:34,441
Vampires.

949
01:18:36,151 --> 01:18:37,402
What about them?

950
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:42,407
They're undead...

951
01:18:42,574 --> 01:18:45,660
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

952
01:18:45,827 --> 01:18:49,372
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

953
01:18:49,539 --> 01:18:51,416
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

954
01:18:52,834 --> 01:18:55,086
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

955
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,797
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

956
01:18:57,964 --> 01:19:00,091
You're not making any sense.

957
01:19:03,136 --> 01:19:04,888
You think I killed Katie?

958
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:07,182
- Celeste.
- What...?

959
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:11,603
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

960
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:15,148
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

961
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:17,067
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

962
01:19:17,234 --> 01:19:18,985
- Dave!
- What?

963
01:19:19,152 --> 01:19:23,907
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

964
01:19:24,074 --> 01:19:25,867
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

965
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:28,119
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

966
01:19:28,286 --> 01:19:32,958
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

967
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:36,962
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

968
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:41,049
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

969
01:19:41,216 --> 01:19:44,135
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

970
01:19:44,302 --> 01:19:46,930
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

971
01:19:47,097 --> 01:19:50,308
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

972
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:52,143
I must have killed her, right?

973
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,271
Fuck!

974
01:20:22,048 --> 01:20:23,550
Henry...

975
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:26,678
What? Henry?

976
01:20:28,972 --> 01:20:31,433
Henry and George.

977
01:20:35,145 --> 01:20:37,355
I never told anyone that before.

978
01:20:39,232 --> 01:20:40,692
Those were their names.

979
01:20:42,277 --> 01:20:44,863
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

980
01:20:48,033 --> 01:20:51,036
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

981
01:20:52,203 --> 01:20:55,749
...they were wolves, and Dave...

982
01:20:56,416 --> 01:21:00,462
...was the boy who escaped from wolves.

983
01:21:02,672 --> 01:21:04,841
What are you talking about, Dave?

984
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:07,761
I'm talking Henry and George.

985
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:11,556
They took me on a four-day ride.

986
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:17,604
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

987
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:21,357
And, man, Celeste...

988
01:21:21,566 --> 01:21:23,276
...did they have their fun.

989
01:21:25,236 --> 01:21:28,615
And no one came to help old Dave then.

990
01:21:30,617 --> 01:21:35,413
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.

991
01:21:40,418 --> 01:21:43,046
You mean, all those years ago...

992
01:21:45,924 --> 01:21:48,343
...when you were a little boy?

993
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:51,638
Dave...

994
01:21:51,804 --> 01:21:53,890
Dave's dead.

995
01:21:55,266 --> 01:21:59,395
I don't know who came out of that cellar,
but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

996
01:22:00,772 --> 01:22:02,190
You see, honey...

997
01:22:02,357 --> 01:22:03,858
Fuck!

998
01:22:04,108 --> 01:22:06,736
It's like vampires.

999
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,783
Once it's in you...

1000
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:15,119
...it stays.

1001
01:22:16,496 --> 01:22:18,540
What stays?

1002
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:28,424
Did you know there were child prostitutes
in Rome Basin?

1003
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,760
What?

1004
01:22:36,558 --> 01:22:38,059
Fuck!

1005
01:22:41,312 --> 01:22:44,315
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1006
01:22:44,482 --> 01:22:46,484
I'm warning you...

1007
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:50,154
...I can't trust my mind.

1008
01:22:53,116 --> 01:22:57,078
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1009
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:00,373
Okay.

1010
01:23:04,919 --> 01:23:06,421
Okay.

1011
01:23:06,879 --> 01:23:08,298
Okay.

1012
01:23:10,008 --> 01:23:13,886
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1013
01:23:14,053 --> 01:23:16,639
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1014
01:23:16,806 --> 01:23:18,599
These things get passed around.

1015
01:23:18,766 --> 01:23:21,728
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1016
01:23:21,894 --> 01:23:24,814
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1017
01:23:24,981 --> 01:23:29,068
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1018
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:33,698
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1019
01:23:33,865 --> 01:23:38,036
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1020
01:23:38,202 --> 01:23:42,373
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1021
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,876
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1022
01:23:45,043 --> 01:23:48,421
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1023
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:52,592
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1024
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:54,052
He's not my friend.

1025
01:23:54,218 --> 01:23:58,723
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1026
01:24:13,321 --> 01:24:14,947
Hey, Jimmy.

1027
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,742
You're out late.

1028
01:24:17,909 --> 01:24:19,619
Yeah, you too.

1029
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:22,872
It's cold, huh?

1030
01:24:23,122 --> 01:24:25,374
Yeah, I guess.

1031
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,425
You know, I...

1032
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:36,969
I been sitting out here...

1033
01:24:37,136 --> 01:24:39,263
...over the last few years...

1034
01:24:41,182 --> 01:24:45,269
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1035
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:51,275
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while."

1036
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:57,657
Weird thing is...

1037
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:00,618
...it seemed to bring her back.

1038
01:25:05,122 --> 01:25:07,166
I saw her, you know.

1039
01:25:09,001 --> 01:25:10,670
Saw who?

1040
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:14,006
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1041
01:25:16,008 --> 01:25:20,137
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1042
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,809
Did you talk to her?

1043
01:25:25,643 --> 01:25:28,145
Just nodded hello at one point.

1044
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,482
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1045
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:39,198
But...

1046
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:40,950
...Jimmy...

1047
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,328
...she looked...

1048
01:25:45,663 --> 01:25:47,164
...happy.

1049
01:26:04,181 --> 01:26:07,351
I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1050
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:22,491
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1051
01:26:22,658 --> 01:26:26,495
- From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1052
01:26:26,662 --> 01:26:28,164
...adjacent to the parkway.

1053
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:32,877
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1054
01:26:33,044 --> 01:26:36,630
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1055
01:26:36,797 --> 01:26:41,719
After I left you last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1056
01:26:41,886 --> 01:26:46,682
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1057
01:26:46,849 --> 01:26:49,560
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1058
01:26:49,727 --> 01:26:53,564
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1059
01:26:53,731 --> 01:26:56,567
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1060
01:26:56,734 --> 01:26:59,487
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1061
01:26:59,653 --> 01:27:02,406
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1062
01:27:02,573 --> 01:27:06,410
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1063
01:27:06,577 --> 01:27:11,457
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1064
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:15,753
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1065
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,421
Bingo.

1066
01:27:18,089 --> 01:27:20,758
You wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1067
01:27:21,092 --> 01:27:24,095
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1068
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:27,389
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1069
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:30,434
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1070
01:27:30,601 --> 01:27:33,813
We know you didn't get that swollen hand
sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1071
01:27:34,438 --> 01:27:39,235
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1072
01:27:39,777 --> 01:27:42,279
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1073
01:27:48,577 --> 01:27:51,455
How about a Sprite or something?

1074
01:27:51,622 --> 01:27:55,668
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1075
01:27:55,835 --> 01:27:57,378
You lied.

1076
01:27:57,545 --> 01:28:00,089
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1077
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:05,135
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1078
01:28:05,302 --> 01:28:09,765
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1079
01:28:09,932 --> 01:28:11,517
Okay.

1080
01:28:13,018 --> 01:28:14,687
All right.

1081
01:28:15,145 --> 01:28:18,315
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1082
01:28:18,482 --> 01:28:21,151
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1083
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,072
What are you looking at him for?

1084
01:28:26,532 --> 01:28:30,202
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1085
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:32,496
Sure.

1086
01:28:32,788 --> 01:28:34,790
Oh, I get it.

1087
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:37,251
You're the good cop.

1088
01:28:37,751 --> 01:28:40,796
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1089
01:28:41,005 --> 01:28:44,174
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1090
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:48,554
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1091
01:28:50,723 --> 01:28:54,226
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1092
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:00,107
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1093
01:29:00,274 --> 01:29:03,485
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1094
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,282
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1095
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:11,118
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1096
01:29:11,285 --> 01:29:14,496
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1097
01:29:14,663 --> 01:29:16,457
Bled like hell.

1098
01:29:16,874 --> 01:29:20,127
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1099
01:29:20,711 --> 01:29:23,881
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1100
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:25,758
What blood type are you?

1101
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:28,093
B-negative.

1102
01:29:28,344 --> 01:29:31,055
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1103
01:29:31,638 --> 01:29:33,724
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1104
01:29:33,891 --> 01:29:36,393
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1105
01:29:37,728 --> 01:29:40,564
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1106
01:29:41,231 --> 01:29:44,401
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1107
01:29:44,568 --> 01:29:47,738
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.

1108
01:29:47,905 --> 01:29:49,615
How will that look in court?

1109
01:29:49,782 --> 01:29:53,702
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1110
01:29:53,869 --> 01:29:56,789
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1111
01:29:57,289 --> 01:29:59,083
What report?

1112
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:03,754
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1113
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:07,174
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1114
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:09,927
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1115
01:30:15,933 --> 01:30:19,436
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1116
01:30:19,686 --> 01:30:23,232
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1117
01:30:23,398 --> 01:30:26,068
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1118
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:28,821
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1119
01:30:28,987 --> 01:30:31,156
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1120
01:30:31,323 --> 01:30:33,617
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1121
01:30:33,784 --> 01:30:37,788
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1122
01:30:38,122 --> 01:30:40,457
Okay. Maybe.

1123
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,628
So, what do we do with Dave?

1124
01:30:46,296 --> 01:30:47,840
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1125
01:30:48,715 --> 01:30:52,636
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1126
01:30:52,845 --> 01:30:56,140
Or this lovely red marble here.

1127
01:30:56,974 --> 01:30:58,809
Or a figural.

1128
01:30:58,976 --> 01:31:00,561
That one.

1129
01:31:01,061 --> 01:31:04,565
Very good. Nice and simple.

1130
01:31:13,031 --> 01:31:14,658
Hey, Jimmy!

1131
01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:20,247
Annabeth said you were here.

1132
01:31:21,582 --> 01:31:23,709
We been asking around, like you said to.

1133
01:31:23,876 --> 01:31:25,419
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1134
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:28,797
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1135
01:31:28,964 --> 01:31:32,050
And it ain't about me missing your brains
running things.

1136
01:31:32,217 --> 01:31:36,638
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1137
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:39,349
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1138
01:31:40,726 --> 01:31:45,522
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1139
01:31:45,689 --> 01:31:49,151
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1140
01:31:49,318 --> 01:31:53,196
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1141
01:31:53,363 --> 01:31:57,242
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1142
01:31:57,492 --> 01:32:00,704
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1143
01:32:00,996 --> 01:32:03,540
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1144
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:08,045
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1145
01:32:08,211 --> 01:32:11,882
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1146
01:32:14,676 --> 01:32:16,178
What?

1147
01:32:19,306 --> 01:32:22,017
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1148
01:32:22,184 --> 01:32:23,727
Tell him.

1149
01:32:25,395 --> 01:32:28,398
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1150
01:32:28,565 --> 01:32:32,277
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1151
01:32:32,986 --> 01:32:35,280
I heard something else
this morning too.

1152
01:32:35,447 --> 01:32:40,118
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe they forgot to ask him something.

1153
01:32:40,744 --> 01:32:43,497
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1154
01:32:43,664 --> 01:32:46,750
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1155
01:33:02,265 --> 01:33:06,019
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1156
01:33:06,186 --> 01:33:08,814
First child, Brendan Seamus,
born 1983."

1157
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:13,610
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1158
01:33:13,777 --> 01:33:16,113
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1159
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:20,450
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1160
01:33:20,617 --> 01:33:25,539
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1161
01:33:25,705 --> 01:33:27,958
...released on lack of evidence again.

1162
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:31,503
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1163
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:35,215
"A known associate, one Edmund Reese,
fingers Raymond...

1164
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:38,969
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection."

1165
01:33:39,136 --> 01:33:40,637
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1166
01:33:40,804 --> 01:33:43,473
Hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1167
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,392
Oh, excuse me.

1168
01:33:45,559 --> 01:33:50,480
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed." Does a year solid inside.

1169
01:33:51,148 --> 01:33:53,650
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1170
01:33:53,817 --> 01:33:56,319
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1171
01:33:56,486 --> 01:33:58,363
Evidently not.

1172
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:02,868
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1173
01:34:03,034 --> 01:34:07,497
...trafficking stolen goods across
state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1174
01:34:07,664 --> 01:34:10,500
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1175
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:15,338
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1176
01:34:15,505 --> 01:34:20,343
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1177
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:22,179
...he does no time.

1178
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:26,391
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1179
01:34:26,558 --> 01:34:30,854
- August 1989, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1180
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:34,316
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1181
01:34:34,482 --> 01:34:38,069
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1182
01:34:38,236 --> 01:34:42,866
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1183
01:34:43,033 --> 01:34:46,870
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1184
01:34:47,537 --> 01:34:49,915
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1185
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:52,709
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1186
01:34:52,876 --> 01:34:57,714
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1187
01:34:58,381 --> 01:35:00,508
...Anthony Waxman."

1188
01:35:02,594 --> 01:35:04,429
And one James Markum.

1189
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:09,059
And the hits just keep on coming.

1190
01:35:12,938 --> 01:35:16,399
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1191
01:35:16,566 --> 01:35:18,652
I already gotta get back.

1192
01:35:19,027 --> 01:35:22,238
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1193
01:35:22,405 --> 01:35:25,909
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1194
01:35:26,076 --> 01:35:30,580
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1195
01:35:30,789 --> 01:35:33,917
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1196
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:37,545
- Think we pulled him over in New Bedford.
- But Harris walked.

1197
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:40,048
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1198
01:35:40,215 --> 01:35:44,427
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1199
01:35:44,594 --> 01:35:46,179
On who?

1200
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:48,973
What the fuck was the name?

1201
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:53,103
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1202
01:35:53,269 --> 01:35:55,063
Jimmy Markum.

1203
01:35:55,313 --> 01:36:00,235
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1204
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:03,279
So did Harris ever testify
in open court?

1205
01:36:03,446 --> 01:36:07,033
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1206
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,954
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1207
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:13,331
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1208
01:36:13,498 --> 01:36:17,043
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1209
01:36:18,294 --> 01:36:20,839
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1210
01:36:21,005 --> 01:36:23,967
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1211
01:36:24,134 --> 01:36:25,802
What's that tell you?

1212
01:36:37,147 --> 01:36:39,816
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1213
01:36:39,983 --> 01:36:42,819
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
- I'm good.

1214
01:36:42,986 --> 01:36:45,655
Okay. Hey.

1215
01:36:45,822 --> 01:36:48,366
- Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1216
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:52,328
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1217
01:36:55,331 --> 01:36:57,000
Step into my office.

1218
01:37:09,262 --> 01:37:10,638
Beautiful day, huh?

1219
01:37:18,771 --> 01:37:20,815
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1220
01:37:26,696 --> 01:37:29,157
I took Michael last night...

1221
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:31,409
...and I went to a motel.

1222
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,871
Okay.

1223
01:37:35,955 --> 01:37:37,790
I don't know, Jim.

1224
01:37:39,209 --> 01:37:41,211
I might have left Dave for good.

1225
01:37:42,712 --> 01:37:44,589
You left Dave?

1226
01:37:47,842 --> 01:37:49,344
Yeah.

1227
01:37:50,553 --> 01:37:52,055
Well...

1228
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:56,935
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1229
01:37:59,604 --> 01:38:01,439
I'm almost afraid of him.

1230
01:38:05,693 --> 01:38:07,445
Do you know something?

1231
01:38:10,573 --> 01:38:13,576
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1232
01:38:14,243 --> 01:38:17,288
He saw Katie the night she was murdered.
Didn't tell me...

1233
01:38:17,455 --> 01:38:19,582
...till after the cops questioned him.

1234
01:38:19,749 --> 01:38:23,920
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1235
01:38:24,796 --> 01:38:27,090
Is there anything else I should know?

1236
01:38:34,931 --> 01:38:36,516
Come here.

1237
01:38:39,143 --> 01:38:40,645
Okay.

1238
01:38:41,729 --> 01:38:44,023
At 3 in the morning...

1239
01:38:44,315 --> 01:38:49,779
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1240
01:38:53,616 --> 01:38:55,618
What did he say happened?

1241
01:38:57,245 --> 01:39:00,748
That he was mugged.
That he...

1242
01:39:00,915 --> 01:39:03,710
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1243
01:39:03,876 --> 01:39:05,128
That...

1244
01:39:05,294 --> 01:39:07,630
That he might have killed him.

1245
01:39:14,303 --> 01:39:17,348
But there was nothing in the paper.

1246
01:39:26,023 --> 01:39:28,985
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1247
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:33,406
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1248
01:39:33,573 --> 01:39:35,074
Celeste?

1249
01:39:39,537 --> 01:39:41,956
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1250
01:39:47,003 --> 01:39:49,005
Okay. All right.

1251
01:39:49,172 --> 01:39:50,673
Okay.

1252
01:39:51,674 --> 01:39:53,509
Oh, God.

1253
01:39:59,724 --> 01:40:01,225
Okay.

1254
01:40:03,811 --> 01:40:05,855
Oh, my God.

1255
01:40:07,064 --> 01:40:10,067
- Tell me about your father, Brendan.
- What?

1256
01:40:10,234 --> 01:40:14,197
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1257
01:40:14,489 --> 01:40:18,242
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1258
01:40:19,327 --> 01:40:21,579
I remember little things.

1259
01:40:22,371 --> 01:40:25,082
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1260
01:40:25,708 --> 01:40:27,210
He...

1261
01:40:27,877 --> 01:40:29,420
He what?

1262
01:40:30,379 --> 01:40:34,884
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1263
01:40:35,384 --> 01:40:37,553
You could always hear him coming home.

1264
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:42,975
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1265
01:40:43,851 --> 01:40:46,229
You remember your father
having a gun?

1266
01:40:46,771 --> 01:40:48,231
No.

1267
01:40:48,397 --> 01:40:52,860
Well, you seem awfully sure for somebody
who was 6 when he left.

1268
01:40:53,611 --> 01:40:55,154
What's up?

1269
01:40:55,321 --> 01:40:58,157
- What's that?
- This is what you asked for.

1270
01:40:58,324 --> 01:41:02,912
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1271
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:04,747
All right, thanks.

1272
01:41:05,456 --> 01:41:08,084
We were talking about your father's gun.

1273
01:41:09,043 --> 01:41:14,465
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1274
01:41:15,299 --> 01:41:18,219
- When was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1275
01:41:18,427 --> 01:41:19,720
Never?

1276
01:41:19,887 --> 01:41:22,181
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1277
01:41:22,348 --> 01:41:25,851
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1278
01:41:26,018 --> 01:41:27,728
Because he's not missing.

1279
01:41:27,895 --> 01:41:30,773
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1280
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:35,361
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1281
01:41:36,612 --> 01:41:39,573
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1282
01:41:41,117 --> 01:41:43,786
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1283
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,624
Who else would send it?

1284
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:51,877
My ma says that's the way he was.

1285
01:41:52,044 --> 01:41:54,964
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1286
01:41:58,634 --> 01:42:01,470
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1287
01:42:03,389 --> 01:42:04,849
You know why, kid.

1288
01:42:05,391 --> 01:42:06,684
No, I don't.

1289
01:42:07,643 --> 01:42:09,478
Gun that killed your girlfriend...

1290
01:42:09,645 --> 01:42:12,523
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1291
01:42:13,441 --> 01:42:14,692
So...

1292
01:42:15,317 --> 01:42:17,319
...you wanna tell me about it?

1293
01:42:20,322 --> 01:42:22,658
My father didn't have a gun.

1294
01:42:22,825 --> 01:42:24,827
You are fucking lying!

1295
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:32,960
Can I go now?

1296
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:36,505
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1297
01:42:49,685 --> 01:42:53,355
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1298
01:42:54,315 --> 01:42:56,066
Hey, Val.

1299
01:42:56,442 --> 01:42:58,736
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1300
01:42:59,445 --> 01:43:01,530
- All right.
- It's fucked up.

1301
01:43:03,949 --> 01:43:05,451
Katie.

1302
01:43:06,869 --> 01:43:08,704
A fucking tragedy.

1303
01:43:09,872 --> 01:43:11,123
Yeah.

1304
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:14,001
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1305
01:43:14,335 --> 01:43:15,586
Yeah?

1306
01:43:16,378 --> 01:43:18,631
Yeah. What do you say, man?

1307
01:43:18,797 --> 01:43:22,593
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1308
01:43:25,221 --> 01:43:28,933
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1309
01:43:29,099 --> 01:43:30,893
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1310
01:43:32,061 --> 01:43:35,231
Well, the first round's on me.

1311
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:38,943
Now you're talking.

1312
01:43:57,461 --> 01:44:02,174
- I think the kid is lying about the gun.
- Absolutely. I told you three times already.

1313
01:44:02,341 --> 01:44:07,346
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1314
01:44:07,721 --> 01:44:09,098
Eighty grand. I mean...

1315
01:44:09,265 --> 01:44:12,935
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1316
01:44:13,978 --> 01:44:17,606
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1317
01:44:17,773 --> 01:44:21,235
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah.

1318
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:23,737
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1319
01:44:23,904 --> 01:44:27,491
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1320
01:44:31,787 --> 01:44:34,957
<i>911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

1321
01:44:35,124 --> 01:44:38,335
<i>There's, like, this car with blood in it,
and the door's open.</i>

1322
01:44:38,502 --> 01:44:41,463
<i>- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.</i>

1323
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:45,384
<i>It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.</i>

1324
01:44:45,551 --> 01:44:48,387
<i>- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.</i>

1325
01:44:48,554 --> 01:44:51,640
<i>- Your name, what's your name?
- We're so fucking out of here.</i>

1326
01:44:51,807 --> 01:44:53,684
<i>Good luck, man.</i>

1327
01:44:53,976 --> 01:44:57,980
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1328
01:44:58,147 --> 01:44:59,732
Her.

1329
01:45:00,482 --> 01:45:03,819
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1330
01:45:08,115 --> 01:45:11,160
<i>- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.</i>

1331
01:45:11,326 --> 01:45:15,456
- He said, "Her name."
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1332
01:45:15,622 --> 01:45:18,208
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1333
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:21,754
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1334
01:45:26,383 --> 01:45:27,718
Play it again.

1335
01:45:34,016 --> 01:45:37,519
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1336
01:45:37,686 --> 01:45:39,980
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
- Here.

1337
01:45:40,147 --> 01:45:44,651
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1338
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:46,320
Fucking Carson.

1339
01:45:46,487 --> 01:45:50,616
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1340
01:45:50,783 --> 01:45:53,202
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1341
01:45:53,368 --> 01:45:59,082
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

1342
01:46:01,168 --> 01:46:03,796
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1343
01:46:03,962 --> 01:46:05,964
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1344
01:46:06,131 --> 01:46:11,428
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1345
01:46:11,595 --> 01:46:13,347
Fucking smiley mask!

1346
01:46:15,808 --> 01:46:17,309
Idiot!

1347
01:46:17,476 --> 01:46:19,937
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1348
01:46:21,855 --> 01:46:26,193
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1349
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,154
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1350
01:46:31,698 --> 01:46:33,742
Why do you think he went straight?

1351
01:46:36,453 --> 01:46:38,914
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1352
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:43,210
What about you guys?

1353
01:46:44,419 --> 01:46:48,215
What? Us? Going straight?

1354
01:46:49,633 --> 01:46:52,094
That's pretty fucking funny!

1355
01:46:55,847 --> 01:47:00,602
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1356
01:47:00,769 --> 01:47:02,437
Want another shot?

1357
01:47:06,024 --> 01:47:11,280
- I should slow down till we eat.
- Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1358
01:47:11,446 --> 01:47:12,864
Come on, get up.

1359
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,122
Live a little, huh?

1360
01:47:47,482 --> 01:47:49,401
Slide over, Dave.

1361
01:47:50,902 --> 01:47:53,989
- Dave.
- All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1362
01:47:54,156 --> 01:47:57,617
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1363
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:02,164
To our children.

1364
01:48:07,002 --> 01:48:08,962
- I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1365
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:12,466
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1366
01:48:12,632 --> 01:48:15,677
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1367
01:48:15,844 --> 01:48:19,431
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1368
01:48:19,598 --> 01:48:22,184
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1369
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:24,936
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1370
01:48:25,103 --> 01:48:26,438
Yeah.

1371
01:48:26,605 --> 01:48:28,356
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1372
01:48:34,237 --> 01:48:36,156
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1373
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:50,170
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1374
01:48:50,879 --> 01:48:52,547
Thanks, Kevin.

1375
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:31,795
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1376
01:49:31,962 --> 01:49:37,342
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles."

1377
01:49:39,761 --> 01:49:42,556
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1378
01:49:42,722 --> 01:49:45,642
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1379
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:47,769
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1380
01:49:48,228 --> 01:49:51,106
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1381
01:49:51,273 --> 01:49:52,774
Come on. Come on, now.

1382
01:49:52,941 --> 01:49:57,946
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1383
01:50:21,052 --> 01:50:22,470
Hey, Ray.

1384
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,445
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1385
01:50:43,325 --> 01:50:45,160
Come here a second.

1386
01:50:50,665 --> 01:50:52,208
Sit down.

1387
01:51:01,593 --> 01:51:04,220
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1388
01:51:04,512 --> 01:51:08,308
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1389
01:51:08,975 --> 01:51:13,772
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1390
01:51:13,938 --> 01:51:16,524
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1391
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:19,319
- That's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1392
01:51:19,486 --> 01:51:21,988
- I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1393
01:51:22,155 --> 01:51:23,406
...when she was dying.

1394
01:51:23,573 --> 01:51:27,827
The death part you do alone, but I
could have helped her with the dying.

1395
01:51:27,994 --> 01:51:30,038
Why are you telling me this?

1396
01:51:30,205 --> 01:51:34,417
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1397
01:51:34,584 --> 01:51:37,045
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1398
01:51:37,212 --> 01:51:38,755
He was begging.

1399
01:51:38,922 --> 01:51:41,674
You know, pregnant wife,
little Brendan.

1400
01:51:42,634 --> 01:51:46,304
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1401
01:51:47,055 --> 01:51:49,891
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1402
01:51:50,725 --> 01:51:52,143
Who do you hate?

1403
01:51:54,395 --> 01:51:55,980
Come on, who?

1404
01:51:56,147 --> 01:51:57,649
No one.

1405
01:51:59,943 --> 01:52:04,739
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1406
01:52:04,906 --> 01:52:08,409
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1407
01:52:08,576 --> 01:52:10,954
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1408
01:52:11,412 --> 01:52:12,914
Who do you love?

1409
01:52:17,544 --> 01:52:19,212
You love me.

1410
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:22,757
What about Ma?

1411
01:52:28,012 --> 01:52:31,599
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1412
01:52:34,602 --> 01:52:38,731
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1413
01:52:38,898 --> 01:52:41,609
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1414
01:52:42,068 --> 01:52:43,778
This is the mugger story.

1415
01:52:43,945 --> 01:52:48,491
He was a child molester.
He was having sex with a kid in his car.

1416
01:52:48,658 --> 01:52:52,453
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1417
01:53:00,628 --> 01:53:01,880
Get out of here.

1418
01:53:14,642 --> 01:53:16,060
Run!

1419
01:53:16,686 --> 01:53:18,313
<i>Dave, run!</i>

1420
01:53:20,481 --> 01:53:24,193
- You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1421
01:53:25,028 --> 01:53:27,989
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1422
01:53:28,156 --> 01:53:32,785
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1423
01:53:32,952 --> 01:53:37,332
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1424
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:42,086
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1425
01:53:42,253 --> 01:53:45,757
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1426
01:53:45,923 --> 01:53:50,345
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1427
01:53:50,511 --> 01:53:52,722
I didn't kill Katie.

1428
01:53:53,514 --> 01:53:57,643
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1429
01:53:57,810 --> 01:54:02,106
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
- Letting this piece of shit explain himself?

1430
01:54:02,273 --> 01:54:05,276
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

1431
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:09,447
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1432
01:54:09,614 --> 01:54:13,201
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1433
01:54:13,368 --> 01:54:14,702
- Fuck!
- Shut up!

1434
01:54:18,956 --> 01:54:20,249
Nineteen years old.

1435
01:54:20,416 --> 01:54:22,877
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

1436
01:54:23,044 --> 01:54:26,214
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

1437
01:54:26,381 --> 01:54:27,799
I'm looking at you.

1438
01:54:27,965 --> 01:54:30,676
Why'd you do it?

1439
01:54:30,843 --> 01:54:36,057
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1440
01:54:36,224 --> 01:54:38,893
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1441
01:54:39,268 --> 01:54:42,021
No more lies, no more secrets.

1442
01:54:42,188 --> 01:54:44,857
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1443
01:54:45,733 --> 01:54:49,946
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1444
01:54:50,905 --> 01:54:54,117
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

1445
01:54:54,283 --> 01:54:56,244
...and I will open you the fuck up.

1446
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:04,961
I thought I was finished with all this.

1447
01:55:05,336 --> 01:55:08,798
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1448
01:55:14,095 --> 01:55:17,640
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1449
01:55:18,057 --> 01:55:22,103
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1450
01:55:22,728 --> 01:55:26,399
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1451
01:55:26,566 --> 01:55:28,484
Admit what you did, Dave.

1452
01:55:28,651 --> 01:55:30,945
Admit what you did.

1453
01:55:32,613 --> 01:55:35,575
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1454
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:37,994
I know you can speak.

1455
01:55:41,122 --> 01:55:44,750
So say it. Say you love me.

1456
01:55:48,129 --> 01:55:51,799
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1457
01:55:59,682 --> 01:56:03,477
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

1458
01:56:10,818 --> 01:56:12,445
I'm coming back!

1459
01:56:18,451 --> 01:56:21,829
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1460
01:56:21,996 --> 01:56:26,792
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1461
01:56:27,001 --> 01:56:29,295
Say her name. Say it.

1462
01:56:29,754 --> 01:56:34,592
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1463
01:56:45,186 --> 01:56:49,690
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1464
01:56:50,358 --> 01:56:52,026
That's a Sig, right?

1465
01:56:54,362 --> 01:56:56,572
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1466
01:56:57,531 --> 01:57:00,034
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1467
01:57:00,326 --> 01:57:03,371
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1468
01:57:04,205 --> 01:57:07,208
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1469
01:57:08,042 --> 01:57:11,003
- He broke my nose.
- We'll arrest him.

1470
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:14,840
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

1471
01:57:15,549 --> 01:57:17,259
I want him fucking dead!

1472
01:57:24,642 --> 01:57:26,852
Motherfucker.

1473
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:29,939
Motherfucker.

1474
01:57:32,233 --> 01:57:35,152
Admit what you did, Dave...

1475
01:57:36,237 --> 01:57:38,239
...and I'll let you live.

1476
01:57:38,406 --> 01:57:42,618
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1477
01:57:42,993 --> 01:57:45,162
You'll go to prison...

1478
01:57:46,247 --> 01:57:49,625
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1479
01:57:49,792 --> 01:57:52,920
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1480
01:57:57,842 --> 01:57:59,593
Yeah.

1481
01:58:01,762 --> 01:58:03,639
Yeah, I did it.

1482
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:08,769
Why?

1483
01:58:08,936 --> 01:58:10,396
Why?

1484
01:58:13,566 --> 01:58:17,862
That night in McGill's...

1485
01:58:18,821 --> 01:58:23,450
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

1486
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,078
What dream?

1487
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:30,040
A dream of youth.

1488
01:58:32,376 --> 01:58:34,962
I don't remember having one.

1489
01:58:37,423 --> 01:58:39,425
So it was the dream?

1490
01:58:41,093 --> 01:58:43,512
The dream, yeah.

1491
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:50,102
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1492
01:58:56,692 --> 01:58:59,653
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1493
01:59:00,946 --> 01:59:03,866
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1494
01:59:25,304 --> 01:59:27,681
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1495
01:59:30,643 --> 01:59:33,020
We wash them clean.

1496
01:59:35,272 --> 01:59:39,526
- Look, his fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

1497
01:59:45,991 --> 01:59:48,035
I wasn't ready.

1498
01:59:54,041 --> 01:59:55,376
It's like I said, Dave.

1499
01:59:58,671 --> 02:00:00,381
This part, you do alone.

1500
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,177
Tough night?

1501
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:51,932
Yeah, me too.

1502
02:00:53,934 --> 02:00:56,854
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1503
02:01:05,571 --> 02:01:07,322
We got them, Jim.

1504
02:01:11,076 --> 02:01:12,453
Got who?

1505
02:01:12,995 --> 02:01:15,164
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1506
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:22,588
Killers, plural.

1507
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:28,719
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. and another kid, John O'Shea.

1508
02:01:28,886 --> 02:01:31,305
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1509
02:01:35,976 --> 02:01:37,352
No doubt?

1510
02:01:38,103 --> 02:01:39,813
None.

1511
02:01:49,114 --> 02:01:50,616
Why?

1512
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:53,911
They don't know.

1513
02:01:54,077 --> 02:01:56,622
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

1514
02:01:56,788 --> 02:02:01,877
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1515
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:07,549
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1516
02:02:07,716 --> 02:02:11,136
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1517
02:02:11,303 --> 02:02:15,224
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1518
02:02:23,148 --> 02:02:25,025
And the beating they gave her?

1519
02:02:27,527 --> 02:02:29,196
Ray Jr. had a hockey stick.

1520
02:02:32,366 --> 02:02:34,618
All right. Go easy.

1521
02:02:34,785 --> 02:02:36,703
Take a breath.

1522
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:39,915
Look at me.

1523
02:02:40,207 --> 02:02:42,125
Look at me, Jimmy.

1524
02:02:44,461 --> 02:02:46,797
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1525
02:02:46,964 --> 02:02:51,301
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1526
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:54,513
We need to talk to him.

1527
02:02:54,888 --> 02:02:59,351
Boston P.D. found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1528
02:02:59,518 --> 02:03:01,937
A body? The body of a guy?

1529
02:03:02,562 --> 02:03:05,732
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1530
02:03:05,983 --> 02:03:08,819
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1531
02:03:09,361 --> 02:03:11,405
So, Jimmy...

1532
02:03:12,364 --> 02:03:14,950
...when was the last time
you saw Dave?

1533
02:03:25,669 --> 02:03:28,880
The last time I saw Dave.

1534
02:03:30,424 --> 02:03:33,635
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1535
02:03:41,935 --> 02:03:46,273
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1536
02:03:48,942 --> 02:03:53,739
That was 25 years ago, going up
this street in the back of that car.

1537
02:04:02,956 --> 02:04:06,960
Jimmy, what did you do?

1538
02:04:15,093 --> 02:04:18,054
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1539
02:04:21,808 --> 02:04:24,311
If only you'd been a little faster.

1540
02:04:32,569 --> 02:04:36,281
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1541
02:04:42,871 --> 02:04:45,499
Sometimes I think...

1542
02:04:46,458 --> 02:04:49,419
I think all three of us got in that car.

1543
02:04:50,253 --> 02:04:54,507
And all of this is just a dream,
you know?

1544
02:04:54,674 --> 02:04:56,843
A dream, sure.

1545
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:00,513
In reality...

1546
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:05,393
...we're still 11-year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

1547
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:09,147
...imagining what our lives
would have been if we'd escaped.

1548
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,366
Maybe you're right.

1549
02:05:19,532 --> 02:05:21,868
Who the fuck knows?

1550
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:52,399
Yeah, this is Sean.

1551
02:05:58,321 --> 02:06:01,408
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1552
02:06:01,574 --> 02:06:03,868
I pushed you away.

1553
02:06:06,621 --> 02:06:09,040
I'm sorry too.

1554
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,794
Things have been so messed up.

1555
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:15,547
Loving you, hating you.

1556
02:06:17,757 --> 02:06:19,426
Come home?

1557
02:06:22,178 --> 02:06:24,139
You change the locks or anything?

1558
02:06:25,265 --> 02:06:27,017
No.

1559
02:06:27,976 --> 02:06:31,104
No, everything is just
the way you left it.

1560
02:06:32,272 --> 02:06:35,066
<i>- Nora.
- What's that?</i>

1561
02:06:36,317 --> 02:06:39,988
Nora. That's our daughter's name,
Sean.

1562
02:06:41,114 --> 02:06:42,866
Nora, huh?

1563
02:06:43,032 --> 02:06:47,036
Well, I like that. Nora.

1564
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:19,194
I killed Dave.

1565
02:07:19,986 --> 02:07:23,114
I killed him, and I threw him
in the Mystic.

1566
02:07:24,157 --> 02:07:26,034
But I killed the wrong man.

1567
02:07:26,701 --> 02:07:28,995
That's what I've done.

1568
02:07:29,662 --> 02:07:32,040
And I can't undo it.

1569
02:07:33,041 --> 02:07:34,876
Jimmy.

1570
02:07:42,717 --> 02:07:45,553
I wanna feel your heart.

1571
02:07:46,346 --> 02:07:47,680
Last night...

1572
02:07:48,097 --> 02:07:52,268
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1573
02:07:52,435 --> 02:07:55,522
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

1574
02:07:55,688 --> 02:07:57,357
...because you created her.

1575
02:07:57,524 --> 02:08:01,444
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1576
02:08:01,611 --> 02:08:05,406
...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

1577
02:08:05,573 --> 02:08:09,410
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1578
02:08:09,577 --> 02:08:13,081
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1579
02:08:13,248 --> 02:08:17,210
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1580
02:08:17,377 --> 02:08:23,424
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1581
02:08:23,591 --> 02:08:26,803
And that is never wrong.

1582
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:32,892
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1583
02:08:33,059 --> 02:08:37,772
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1584
02:08:46,281 --> 02:08:50,785
You said, "Last night." You knew?

1585
02:08:51,869 --> 02:08:54,080
Celeste called, looking for you.

1586
02:08:54,247 --> 02:08:57,583
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

1587
02:08:57,750 --> 02:09:00,586
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1588
02:09:00,753 --> 02:09:03,923
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1589
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:08,261
- Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1590
02:09:08,678 --> 02:09:10,930
Their daddy's a king.

1591
02:09:11,097 --> 02:09:15,351
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

1592
02:09:15,518 --> 02:09:17,103
Even when it's hard.

1593
02:09:17,270 --> 02:09:21,649
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

1594
02:09:21,816 --> 02:09:24,610
And that's all that matters.

1595
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:33,161
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1596
02:09:33,327 --> 02:09:35,621
Everyone but us.

1597
02:09:35,788 --> 02:09:37,957
We will never be weak.

1598
02:09:38,124 --> 02:09:40,293
And you...

1599
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:43,880
You could rule this town.

1600
02:09:47,675 --> 02:09:50,303
And after, Jimmy...

1601
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:53,222
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1602
02:09:53,389 --> 02:09:56,142
Katie would have liked that.

1603
02:11:33,155 --> 02:11:35,074
Michael!

1604
02:11:35,741 --> 02:11:39,954
Michael! Michael!

1605
02:11:41,247 --> 02:11:43,249
Michael!

1606
02:11:43,833 --> 02:11:45,751
Michael!

1607
02:17:40,355 --> 02:17:42,441
