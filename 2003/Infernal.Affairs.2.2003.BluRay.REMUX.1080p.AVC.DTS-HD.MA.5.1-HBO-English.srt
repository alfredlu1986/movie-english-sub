1
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,716
AVICI

2
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,011
CONTINUOUS HELL
UNINTERRUPTED TIME

3
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,429
UNLIMITED SPACE

4
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,889
BOUNDLESS SUFFERING
FOR THE FALLEN SOULS

5
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,475
UNINTERRUPTED TIME

6
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,395
TIME

7
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,439
I still remember my first arrest.

8
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,819
It was December 12, 1980.

9
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,950
My partner and I were walking the beat
on Hanoi Road.

10
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,538
Got the call that shit was going down
at New World Centre.

11
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,040
We rushed over.

12
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,252
It was a big knife fight
between two gangs.

13
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,630
Around 15 or so were already down.

14
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,883
Lots of blood on the ground.

15
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,595
I saw a severed hand,
still holding a knife.

16
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,269
My partner told me to draw my gun.

17
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,649
I was a rookie, so I did what he told me.

18
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,985
But before I could open the holster,

19
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,072
my partner was already down.

20
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,744
This kid stabbed him in his belly
with a pipe.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,998
Blood gushed out of the sawed-off opening.

22
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,211
I didn't know what to think.

23
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:53,048
I simply emptied all six of my bullets
straight into that kid.

24
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,512
I don't remember how many years he got.

25
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,766
But when I saw him again two years ago,

26
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,561
he was boozing at the Regal,
looking sharp.

27
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,565
His drinking buddies
were all Kwun's goons.

28
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,489
Those who kill get golden belts,

29
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,574
while those who fix roads
perish with mangled corpses.

30
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,500
I can barely recall my partner's face now.

31
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,753
But, I really regret...

32
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,590
not putting those six bullets
into that kid's skull.

33
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,849
The world shouldn't be like this.

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,728
That's not the way it should be, Sam.

35
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,486
How long have you been around
Tsim Sha Tsui?

36
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,364
Almost two years now.

37
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,786
Do you know why I haven't messed with you?

38
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,205
'Cause I am handsome?

39
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,833
Maybe.

40
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,754
‘Cause I think you're a decent guy.

41
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:20,135
My life will be much easier
if you're in charge in Tsim Sha Tsui.

42
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,262
Forget about it.

43
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,848
You couldn't waste the kid
even with six bullets.

44
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,933
That makes you a decent guy too, right?

45
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,937
You didn't hear this from me,
but I'd rather not be one.

46
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,156
Kwun gave me everything, even my life.

47
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,242
If I killed him for you,

48
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,288
I'd be despicable
even in your eyes, right?

49
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,543
-I knew you'd say that!
-But it's true!

50
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,840
It takes more than chivalry
to work for the Ngai family.

51
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,932
My master often says to me,

52
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,560
"Retribution always takes its sweet time."

53
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,274
No can do. Guess we won't be
sharing meals for a while.

54
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,196
Time to work!

55
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,116
This early? What's the rush?

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,952
My boys've got to eat too!

57
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,912
Take the whole box.

58
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,372
That's okay. It's all yours.

59
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,165
Don't worry about it. Just go.

60
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,709
I'm going!

61
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,963
Hey.

62
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,717
Wanna use the back door?

63
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,012
Ain't no rules against
schmoozing with cops.

64
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,182
The front door's fine! Got used to it.

65
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,908
Prat Avenue!

66
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,181
Prat Avenue, please.

67
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,939
Is Uncle Kwun in?

68
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,734
Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you!

69
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,584
Bye, Mary.

70
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:23,480
They say this antique American amp's got
sweet high, crisp middle and deep bass.

71
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,982
I say it's bullshit!

72
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,570
180 grand! Who can afford it in Hong Kong?

73
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,489
Sit.

74
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,204
Around 10,000 people, maybe.

75
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,456
Sam asked you to be a mole in the force.

76
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,335
If you don't like it, I can talk to him.

77
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,920
After all, you're my boy.

78
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,924
It's fine.

79
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,134
Sure?

80
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,096
Positive.

81
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,517
Hand me that bag.

82
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,188
Mary.

83
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,735
You haven't talked much lately.
I thought you'd been dreading it.

84
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,657
Hide in Tuen Mun till things quiet down.

85
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,909
Stay fit for the Academy's new term.

86
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,540
The money I gave you, spend it wisely.

87
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,586
You like the song?

88
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,714
Yeah.

89
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,221
It's yours.

90
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,850
It won't sound as good
on another player though.

91
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,645
I'll pick out a good one for you
after you've earned a little money.

92
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,233
What? Don't like it?

93
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,155
Not at all.
Sam gave you this watch, didn't he?

94
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,198
None of your business.

95
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,206
Only you and I...

96
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,667
know about tonight.

97
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,961
I don't want Sam to know.

98
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,005
Why's that?

99
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,175
Women are simple.

100
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,971
I'd do anything as long as
a man treats me well.

101
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,351
Now go home. I'm very busy tonight.

102
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:42,785
I mean, that's the rules of the game.
It's either you or me.

103
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,039
Boss said I would see blood today.

104
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,586
The Mainlanders looked up to me.
They kept asking,

105
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,422
"Got a Mercedes today, Brother Keung?"

106
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,591
I said, "Of course." And here I am.

107
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,054
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with you.

108
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,599
I would be hugging girls
at China City Club.

109
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,851
That's for sure!

110
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,359
Hey, got a smoke?

111
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,487
I don't smoke.

112
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,046
Let's forget about it. My car's fine.

113
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,382
See? She says it's all good.

114
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,427
I mean look at her, dressed all dandy.

115
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,681
Does she look like someone
who wants any trouble?

116
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,476
Look at me. All beaten up by you.

117
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,938
Who do you think the judge would believe?

118
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,567
Also, I bet you guys never hang out
at Tsim Sha Tsui East, huh?

119
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,861
Know who I am? I'm Keung.

120
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,282
Sam's top dog. Del Piero's boy.

121
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,994
I'll kick your ass every time I see you,
and you can count on that.

122
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,974
Hey, you.

123
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,935
How about calling an ambulance, sir?

124
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,562
Look at all the blood!

125
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,148
Have them bring 500 cc, Type O. It's rare.

126
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,441
Shut up!

127
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,484
Save it till we're back at the station.

128
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,486
Take him.

129
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,488
Why do I have to go to the station?

130
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,700
I only stole a piece of junk, sir!
What have I done to deserve the OCTB?

131
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,535
-Just shut up!
-Does that deserve an OCTB beating?

132
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,203
Don't you know you're just a cadet?

133
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,373
And you thought you were going to be
at the top of your class?

134
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,709
Don't ever let Yip know about this.

135
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,597
Happy birthday, Chief Yip!

136
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,849
What's there to be happy about?

137
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,603
Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell.

138
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,485
Well, you even managed to get me out.
Your case is now ancient history.

139
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,237
Think of a way to get yourself out too.

140
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,368
So what if the commissioner
is Chinese now?

141
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,537
Still six more years
till all the Brits are out of here.

142
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,456
I'll be 48 by then.

143
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:39,337
Might as well train a few good cops
from there.

144
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,715
The world is yours after 1997.

145
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,762
27149! Cheers!

146
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,097
Yan.

147
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,807
It's been beeping all day.

148
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,767
How come you don't call back? Girlfriend?

149
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,228
-Cheers, sir!
-Cheers!

150
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,772
Just leave me alone!
It's none of my business.

151
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,816
I don't want to know a thing.
Go! Leave me alone!

152
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,115
Law!

153
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,158
What's all this?

154
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,370
My father just passed away.

155
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,252
It was his wish to inform his children

156
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,797
when something bad happened to him.

157
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,427
Sorry to have bothered you.

158
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,743
Stop watching TV, Negro! Eat first!

159
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,998
I wanna see what the news have
on Kwun's death.

160
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,417
Did you do it, Ching?

161
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,297
I've got a big mouth. Had I done it,
you would've heard about it.

162
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,506
Ask Wah and Gandhi.

163
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,094
I was in Macau when Kwun died.

164
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,179
Everybody knows!

165
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,681
But I bet his kids think I did it.

166
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,184
I ain't scared of nothing.

167
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,061
The eldest son's a doctor,
the youngest a brat.

168
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,523
The daughter's been married for ages.
Only the middle son's running the show.

169
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,902
I'll make sure they pay
if they go too far!

170
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,489
It's our fault for failing to protect
Uncle Kwun.

171
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,991
Uncle John! That's enough.

172
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,826
Dad used to say,

173
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,163
"What goes around comes around."

174
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,209
It came later than expected already.

175
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,963
Wah, Ching, Negro and Gandhi.

176
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,716
Guess what those four are thinking?

177
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
Thank you. Thank you very much.

178
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,353
How's Mom doing, Sis?

179
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,189
She's fine. Been sleeping.

180
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,527
She wants us to bring some cigs
to the morgue for Dad.

181
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,986
I'll go get them.

182
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,121
B Team, watch Tak Shing Street.

183
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:24,252
C Team, watch the Austin Road exit
of that financial building.

184
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,755
It has two exits:
one on Tak Shing Street, one on Austin...

185
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,136
Hello?

186
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,806
Why didn't you call me that Kwun was dead?

187
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,976
I called everybody the minute it happened.

188
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,688
Kwun's boys can't sit still. Shit will
hit the fan in Tsim Sha Tsui tonight.

189
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,022
It's the 14th already, you know?

190
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,734
Today's the 14th.
Time to pay the Ngai Family.

191
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,863
Well, since I'm the junior here,

192
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,490
I'll be the jackass.

193
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,244
I'm not paying the Ngais anymore.

194
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,413
What do you three think?

195
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,343
Inspector Wong! What's up?

196
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,637
What are your men doing
outside Wah's building?

197
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,722
-Not a good day for chitchat.
-Are you up to something?

198
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,223
Fine, fine. Next time.

199
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,480
Wow! What's the occasion?

200
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,816
Come on. Where's my seat?

201
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,742
We're cool if you're
only here for the food.

202
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,703
All other business will have to wait.

203
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,747
The food! It's all about the food!

204
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,590
Some big shit is going down tonight.

205
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,095
Let the Big Four do their thing.
We'll clean up the mess.

206
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,473
Can't let them start fighting,

207
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,433
or you'll see bodies.

208
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,352
So what? You're not satisfied?

209
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,564
You know the rule. Pick a card.

210
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,858
Okay. Higher card wins.

211
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,943
Come on!

212
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,458
I told him there's nothing left
to talk about! What does he want now?

213
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,587
What's up, Hau?

214
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,839
Wah.

215
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,509
Nothing much. Heard you're planning
a casino in Macau.

216
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,472
I've got their officials on my payroll.
How about a joint venture?

217
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,393
Uncle Kwun's dead. I'm not in the mood.

218
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,357
I see.

219
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,694
Your Macau trip wasn't all business.

220
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,990
I know you had fun with Gandhi's wife.

221
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,604
Sorry, but I can't let go of my casino
in Macau.

222
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,646
Gotta go.

223
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,252
What are Sam's people doing?

224
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,130
I know Wah paid up!

225
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,843
Don't change the subject.
Tell me something I don't know.

226
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,972
Call me when you get your shit straight!

227
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,353
Hau took care of Wah
in less than ten minutes.

228
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,106
The Big Four are having a tough time.

229
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,570
My mole said Hau took out
a million's worth of coke.

230
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,379
What's this?

231
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,548
A Mafia roadblock?

232
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,688
I don't know why Wah paid up, Mr. Ngai.

233
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,981
But I ain't gonna negotiate.

234
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,192
I don't plan to negotiate with you either.
Pass the phone to Negro.

235
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,444
Hey, Negro.

236
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,906
Don't know why he calls you from my turf.

237
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,869
What's up, Hau?

238
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,580
I'm with Gandhi all the way.

239
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,667
If he's not paying, then neither will I.

240
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,129
Heard you and Gandhi have been tight.

241
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,049
The heroin you two smuggled got robbed.

242
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,635
You both lost several million each, right?

243
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,723
Luckily,
I found the stuff in your warehouse.

244
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,183
Want me to hand it back to Gandhi now?

245
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,105
What's he talking about?

246
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:38,125
Among the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Fives,
Wah and Negro paid up.

247
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,003
Counting Sam, that's 3 to 2.

248
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,423
I'm the youngest here. Gotta pay!

249
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,635
See ya!

250
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,060
Don't think too much. Cheers!

251
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,778
Pay my share for me.

252
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,869
Mr. Ngai went to eat, Inspector Wong.

253
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,324
A bit late for chow, Mr. Ngai.

254
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,829
My dad always came here after work.

255
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,124
I have to keep up the ritual.

256
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,960
Want to join us?

257
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,506
It's your seat from now on. Must be tough.

258
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,717
Not at all.

259
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,636
You guys worked all night for nothing.

260
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,888
Now, that's tough.

261
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,102
You've really done well tonight, Hau.

262
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,147
Hope you can keep it up.

263
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,607
Don't let it turn into a tragedy.
Let's go.

264
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,401
What did you say?

265
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,906
We want to celebrate!

266
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,617
Kwun's dead! Time to pop the champagne!

267
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,467
Want me to pop one for you?

268
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,636
What?

269
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,097
Want to mess with cops?

270
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,021
Hey, officers!

271
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,024
The Ngais are in mourning.

272
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,442
What more do you want?

273
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,656
Let's go. Go!

274
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,958
Sam.

275
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,838
Thanks.

276
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,645
Dad used to operate street gambling here.

277
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,564
Started out as...

278
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,442
a nickel-and-dime business.

279
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,071
Now everyone knows him in Tsim Sha Tsui.

280
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,625
He often said...

281
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,504
"What goes around comes around."

282
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,840
And now he's...

283
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,474
I'll always remember this day.

284
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:11,148
Hi honey. It's all good now.
Want some snacks?

285
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,318
Glad to hear it. Just come home.

286
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:28,081
27149. An officer has to have
a clean background.

287
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,961
Though you cut your ties with the Ngai
and used your mother's last name,

288
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,548
you still share the same father with Hau.

289
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,093
That means you violated conduct
by concealing your background.

290
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,137
I have to let you go.

291
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,432
But before you leave,

292
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,809
go see "Mr. Wrong Socks" first.

293
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,234
Still want to be a cop?

294
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,323
Can I still?

295
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,118
As long as you can give me a good reason.

296
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,958
I want to be a good person.

297
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,077
If you want to be a cop, then help me out.

298
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,453
You have no other choice.

299
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,040
You picked me
cause I'm Hau's brother, right?

300
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,795
When the time comes,
will you arrest him yourself?

301
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,673
How do I start?

302
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,250
Squat.

303
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,519
You okay?

304
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,943
Hanging in there?

305
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,648
What's wrong?

306
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,858
Does it still hurt?

307
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,070
My dad passed away today.

308
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,448
He was so good to me!

309
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,076
I asked the officer

310
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,497
if I could go to his funeral.

311
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,333
The officer said,

312
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:03,088
"Know what it means to be a prisoner?

313
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,301
It means you're not allowed

314
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,180
to even attend your father's funeral.

315
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,890
Don't you know that?

316
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,394
Get out of here!"

317
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,937
Come on. Stop that.

318
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,350
TIME

319
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,550
Are you nuts?

320
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,971
You sent Yan to be a mole?
Don't you know Hau's his half-brother?

321
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,478
So what?

322
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,023
Bring me his file.

323
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,532
So you're playing the boss now, huh?

324
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,203
You know damn well
the files are classified.

325
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,626
I treat you like a brother
and this is what I get?

326
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,275
If I am a brother to you,
you'd stop asking.

327
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,578
It's okay.

328
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,580
Calm down.

329
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,790
Talk it over.

330
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,917
She had an abortion!

331
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,631
That's no big deal. It's just a baby!

332
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,092
You can always have another one.
That's how it works!

333
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,682
I've been with you for four years,

334
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,935
and I've bailed you out tons of times.

335
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,356
One minute we're dining with my folks and

336
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,816
the next you're in a gang fight!

337
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,737
I don't want our baby to grow up like you.
Don't you understand?

338
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,934
Why're you looking so uptight?

339
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,311
I'm not.

340
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,107
Uncle John says you're doing well.

341
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,403
Ever thought about helping the family out?

342
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,575
I know you don't want others to know
your relations with the Ngais.

343
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,247
But we're blood brothers,
and that's a fact.

344
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,207
Right?

345
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,880
It's my daughter's birthday this Sunday.
You're invited.

346
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,468
You really hate talking to me, huh?

347
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,678
No.

348
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,486
Promoted already?

349
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,114
Soon you'll be a superintendent.

350
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,533
Might as well become a full-time cop.

351
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,497
Sam's joking with you. Go ahead, smile.

352
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,878
Thanks for your intel
these couple of years.

353
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,756
When you were still a rookie,

354
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,968
I helped you catch some small potatoes.

355
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,180
It's about time for you to catch
some big shots.

356
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,431
How about catching me?

357
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,684
Why so dirty here?
Or you can catch hot chicks!

358
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,436
What are you doing?

359
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,230
What a hot hoochie mama

360
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,025
Your man must be one good-looking bastard.

361
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,485
That man is you!

362
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,905
-Gotta go.
-Already?

363
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,073
Gotta work! I'm meeting Mr. Ngai.

364
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,633
Sam's so good to you.

365
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,221
But he's not good to himself.

366
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,933
It's been four years.

367
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,561
He could be in charge by now.

368
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,649
But he gave everything to the Ngais.

369
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,612
Now the Ngais are untouchable.

370
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,283
Hau will go after his father's killer
for sure.

371
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,036
These past four years...

372
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,248
I haven't been sleeping well.

373
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,042
Hello, I'm Inspector Wong Chi Shing.

374
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,377
Don't worry, Mary.

375
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,088
I won't let anything happen to you.

376
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,424
You better mean it.

377
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,511
Yes.

378
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,133
Toss it up!

379
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,395
Two days ago, a real estate agent came.

380
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,397
Guess how much he offered?

381
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,693
One hundred sixty million!

382
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,112
What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me.

383
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,406
When my dad bought it,

384
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,118
it was nine million and... 280,000.

385
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,078
What has this world come to?

386
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,538
Trading houses, Mr. Ngai?

387
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,125
1997 is approaching. Time to emigrate.

388
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,755
No big deal.
Communication's easy nowadays.

389
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,215
We're just a phone call away.

390
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,801
I'm just worried about the phone bill.

391
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,388
You know how greedy the phone company is.

392
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,142
I've discussed it with Mom.

393
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:40,063
Our businesses are on the right track.

394
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,900
And you guys have helped out
so much in the past.

395
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,695
So I don't want to be ungrateful.

396
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:52,742
I want to split the business up
among you guys.

397
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,996
You can treat it as a gift
or a retirement fund.

398
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,461
Let's eat! Help yourself!

399
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,757
We should hang out like this more often.

400
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,683
Mr. Ngai.

401
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,685
Are you leaving for real?

402
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,817
All hell will break loose
after you're gone.

403
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,568
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?

404
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,572
"Easy to start. Hard to let go."

405
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,368
I'm letting go today.
You should be happy for me.

406
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,123
I've thought about it.

407
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,334
Cocaine will definitely be the future.

408
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,714
Those four ship it in small bags
from South America.

409
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,340
They're just small-timers.

410
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,760
I've closed a deal with the Thais.

411
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,929
You'll have a monopoly.

412
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,182
You'll be the top dog, leader of the pack.

413
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,187
Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics.

414
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,368
You thinking' about getting rid
of those four?

415
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,057
Move closer to the centre, please.

416
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,808
Yan.

417
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,144
Come join the family portrait.

418
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,815
Stand next to me here.

419
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,445
All right. One more shot.

420
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,822
One, two, three!

421
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,282
One more!

422
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,285
I haven't been around much
these past two years.

423
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,997
It's rare to spend time
with the whole family like this.

424
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,668
Your siblings are
in legitimate businesses.

425
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,340
It's time you helped out the family.

426
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,134
Everything Dad did was for the family.

427
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,178
I did the same.

428
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,097
I hope you will too.

429
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,773
A deal's coming up next week.
Come with me.

430
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,486
I'll call you.

431
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,767
I think he's taking the deal seriously.

432
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,520
He'll go in person next Wednesday.

433
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,066
The 14th... Kwun's death anniversary.

434
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,985
Hau wants to whack the Big Four.

435
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,364
Why does he send Sam away?

436
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,286
Don't know. Sam should be of help to him.

437
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,499
Unless he wants to kill Sam too!

438
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,974
I've been following you around for days.

439
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:51,230
After all, I'm your superior.
I want to know what your plan is.

440
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,864
The Ngais are your family.

441
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,366
Do you really know what you're doing?

442
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,251
I'm a cop.

443
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,216
Good. Give me a salute.

444
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,390
I've booked a table for dinner.
Care to join?

445
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,021
Do I look cool in my cap?

446
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,660
Sit.

447
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,914
Check this out.

448
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,168
What'll you do in Thailand
with this outfit?

449
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,212
Have some shark fin soup,

450
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,673
a massage,
and get two hookers for a threesome.

451
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,840
That's for sure.

452
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,471
-Honey!
-What?

453
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,556
Why didn't you tell me
you're going to Thailand?

454
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,767
It's a business trip! Not for pleasure!

455
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,811
Don't worry. I'll behave.

456
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,355
Hau plans to whack Wah and those guys.

457
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,275
I know.

458
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,069
But do you know he wants to whack you too?

459
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,073
Nonsense! How can that be?

460
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,118
Just wait for me at the airport!

461
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,830
Time to board, Sam.

462
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,377
KAI TAK AIRPORT, HONG KONG

463
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,518
That's all I can do for now.

464
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,397
Call Sam again when the plane lands.

465
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,403
I'm going to kill Hau tonight.

466
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,864
Don't do anything rash.

467
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,949
I'm not being rash.

468
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,288
I only remember you told me

469
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,333
to kill Kwun four years ago.

470
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,635
So what? Are you blackmailing me?

471
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,220
I'm not blackmailing you.

472
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,017
It's just that we've both passed
the point of no return.

473
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,918
I'll send everybody away.

474
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,430
Tonight's operation must be kept secret.

475
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,932
We'll divide into three teams.

476
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,061
Team A watches here.

477
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,354
Team B, here.

478
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,481
You will not take action
until you get my order.

479
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,901
Team C follows the target until...

480
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,155
Why didn't you tell me
about the date change?

481
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,285
I've said it before.
Hau changes his mind all the time.

482
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,791
You think Yan's the only mole?

483
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,293
My man's been undercover for seven years.

484
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,338
Where's the deck of cards?

485
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,729
We'll run the show together tonight.

486
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,942
Let's go!

487
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,800
-Don't move!
-Hold it right there!

488
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:38,280
Well, Hau?

489
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,033
Zipping it till your lawyer gets here?

490
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,119
Come on, cooperate with us!

491
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,248
In fact, I appreciate your cooperation.

492
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,043
Are you speaking Zen, Mr. Ngai?

493
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,419
I don't get it.

494
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,257
Dad used to say,

495
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,969
"The way things work in the streets,

496
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,223
what goes around always comes around."

497
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,978
He died four years ago. It's about time.

498
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,990
The stove's hot enough now, boss!

499
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,842
She's here, boss.

500
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,927
You're here now.

501
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,764
What more can you do?

502
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,931
Wait and see.

503
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,728
We checked, boss.
The two foreigners are private eyes.

504
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,259
Honey!

505
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,427
Where are you?

506
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,887
Thailand, of course!

507
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,224
-Come back right away!
-Are you nuts? Why should I come back?

508
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,393
Don't ask! Just come back!

509
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,353
Hau wants you dead!

510
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,897
I'm working for him, silly!

511
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,315
Listen to me.

512
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,362
I'm the one who killed Kwun.

513
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,624
You've got a VCR?

514
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,256
Is it good?

515
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,426
It's very good.

516
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,972
Play it by ear. Run if you have to.

517
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,182
What did Hau say?

518
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,157
-Sam.
-Sunny!

519
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,267
I only remember you fold me

520
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,311
to kill Kwun four years ago.

521
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,816
So what? Are you blackmailing me?

522
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,359
I'm not blackmailing you.

523
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,072
It's just that we've both passed
the point of no return.

524
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,952
I'll send everybody away.

525
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,917
I hired Alan and Johnson

526
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:10,797
to investigate my father's murder.

527
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:25,479
Who could've guessed a police officer
would knowingly break the law

528
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,732
and murder a law-abiding citizen
like my father?

529
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,154
Superintendent Luk.

530
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,116
Isn't that a police officer in the video?

531
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:01,556
Whether to nab him or not,

532
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,517
that's up to you.

533
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,736
What a good show.

534
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,827
You were so photogenic.

535
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,447
Four years ago...

536
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,284
How much did Sam's woman pay you?

537
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,665
Give us another chance, Mr. Ngai!

538
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,284
I gave them a chance four years ago.

539
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,286
They didn't take it.

540
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,540
If I give you a chance today,

541
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,962
are you going to take it?

542
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,311
You've been with us for seven years now.

543
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,939
You're a cop.

544
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,611
And we're the triads.

545
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,072
Time to accept our fates.

546
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,662
You can't blame me.

547
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,874
Your Inspector Wong killed my dad.

548
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:00,957
Any word from Sam?

549
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,879
Sam called me. He said he was fine.

550
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:10,216
He asked you to hide out here
and wait for him.

551
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,935
Where are your folks?

552
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:23,688
All emigrated.

553
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,193
You didn't go with them?

554
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,562
Let's go, Sam! We got rid of the Thais.
Let's go!

555
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,359
You know you're not going to make it.

556
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:11,110
I know.

557
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,906
My woman's in danger in Hong Kong.

558
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,117
Please help me.

559
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,744
Why should I?

560
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,539
‘Cause I helped you whack your boss.

561
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,417
I know you want to be in charge.

562
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,796
And...

563
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,654
I've always treated you as a good friend.

564
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,745
Don't believe him, Sam! Don't!

565
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,163
Get lost!

566
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,790
-Don't believe him!
-Get lost!

567
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:25,518
I'm sorry, Sam.

568
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,389
Are you here to arrest me?

569
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,641
If you're going to kill Hau,

570
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,018
then I will.

571
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,065
Then there's nothing to talk about.

572
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,320
I've spoken with the higher ups.

573
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,824
They're with you all the way this time.

574
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,494
How? I instigated murder.

575
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,585
Even the Brits agree that...

576
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,505
we can't let the triads break us.

577
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,009
The whole department's behind you.

578
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,137
Good enough?

579
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,058
Where's your deck of cards?

580
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,317
Same, the highest point wins.

581
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,780
I'm calling the shots.
Come back with me to the station.

582
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,660
The car key.

583
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,540
Forget it. I screwed up.
No need to drag everyone down with me.

584
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,395
We found this deck
on our first raid together.

585
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,148
You've been keeping it all this time.
I knew that all along.

586
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:23,780
I've let you have your way
all these years.

587
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,616
It's your turn to listen to me for once.

588
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,243
We're like brothers.
Think I'm just gonna be a spectator?

589
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,711
Law's my snitch in the Ngai Family.

590
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,174
He hasn't contacted me for days.

591
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,385
And neither has Yan.

592
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,555
The key.

593
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:36,894
Get outta there!!

594
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,313
Help! Somebody get help!

595
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:23,834
Why did you lie to me?

596
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,129
I didn't.

597
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,423
Something happened to Sam.

598
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,094
I told you I was a simple woman.

599
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,471
I have to do something for my husband.

600
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,515
I'm going to Thailand.

601
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,850
Can you not go?

602
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,271
Forget it! Just treat it
as if you've never followed us.

603
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,567
I mean, I don't want you to go.

604
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,076
You've been with Sam for years.

605
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,037
Has it occurred to you...

606
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:04,333
-That maybe Sam's dead?
-What did you say?

607
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,585
I can take care of you.

608
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,885
-What are you doing?
-I don't want you to go.

609
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:18,931
You're out of line!

610
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,524
I'm telling you.

611
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,110
I'm your boss's woman.

612
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,492
Don't let me see your face again.

613
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,840
She will go to the airport tonight...

614
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,176
Hello? Hello?

615
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,347
I'm the one who killed Kwun.

616
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,226
I'd do anything
as long as a man treats me well.

617
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,981
TIME

618
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,949
File number 103142.

619
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:08,702
About Inspector Wong conspiring in murder.

620
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:12,623
This is the 11th internal hearing.

621
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,460
Inspector Wong, do you have any questions?

622
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,963
No...

623
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,130
No.

624
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:34,311
On April 11, 1995,

625
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,731
the Complaints and Internal Investigations
Branch received this videotape

626
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,944
accusing you of conspiring with the triads
in a murder.

627
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,237
I plead guilty, sir.

628
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,337
What happened to you?

629
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,758
If I told you...

630
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,636
that all the so-called evidence
couldn't stand,

631
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,515
would you like to start over?

632
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,227
I'm sorry.

633
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,438
I broke the law.

634
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,578
I'm grateful to all of you.

635
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,540
But I've got no confidence left.

636
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,708
I lost.

637
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,460
What about Luk, then?

638
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,838
Can you face him if you give up now?

639
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,300
The war's not over, Wong.

640
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:51,638
We all want closure to this incident.

641
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,728
We need to send a message that Hong Kong
is not run by the Ngai Family.

642
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,944
Here's a file from Interpol.

643
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,280
Read it before you make up your mind.

644
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,262
Ever been to a funeral in Thailand?

645
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:36,892
A few months ago,

646
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:39,395
I had one there for my wife.

647
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:45,401
The monks chanted
for three full days and nights.

648
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:52,533
I didn't shed a single tear.

649
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,871
But, on the day of the burial,

650
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:03,836
the pallbearers moved the casket
to the living room.

651
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,005
I was furious.

652
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,341
I wanted to beat them up.

653
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,262
The head monk said...

654
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,724
it's a tradition in Thailand.

655
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:21,478
The deceased...

656
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,690
as long as we keep her company...

657
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,609
for a little while longer...

658
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,530
she can then rest in eternal peace.

659
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,619
But then I asked the monk...

660
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,834
"My wife's not in the coffin.

661
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,796
Could she still rest in eternal peace?"

662
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,097
Sorry about your wife.

663
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,106
The monk placed his hand here.

664
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,194
He said, "Not a problem.

665
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:14,531
As long as your wife's here."

666
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,706
And here's exactly...

667
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,753
where the Thai shot me.

668
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,134
So I said to myself...

669
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,935
I've passed the point of no return.

670
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:52,069
Testifying against Hau in Hong Kong
could be dangerous.

671
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,743
You're so handsome.
I have confidence in you.

672
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,708
Haven't heard that for ages. Thanks.

673
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,505
What's your plan?

674
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,801
Just trying to do my best.

675
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,262
No big deal. It's my job.

676
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,849
I'll leave Hong Kong
when this is all over.

677
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,402
Wong.

678
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:52,921
You've changed!

679
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,386
Baby!

680
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:47,809
You diluted the coke, didn't you?

681
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,648
Got anything to say?

682
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,330
It's all yours then!

683
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,421
Don't go too far, Yan.

684
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:18,924
It might break the boys' morale.

685
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,680
Mr. Ngai asked me to be in charge here.

686
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,350
Don't like it?
Then take him to the hospital.

687
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:46,910
No matter what, they're still elders.

688
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,622
You've got a lot to learn from them.

689
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,419
Uncle John will retire in a few years.

690
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:59,715
You know what I mean?

691
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,593
I don't need any hiccups now.

692
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:10,475
The Labor Athletic Association
is hosting a dinner reception

693
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,854
for all the Political Consultative
candidates.

694
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,065
If everything works out,

695
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,777
our family will no longer live
in the shadows.

696
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:45,719
CELEBRATE THE HANDOVER

697
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:49,139
Mr. Cheung.

698
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:50,599
Mr. Ngai.

699
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,017
How are you?

700
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,728
When Solicitor Hung mentioned you,

701
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:55,979
I could hardly believe him.

702
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,816
You're so young and promising, Mr. Ngai.

703
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,109
What's your Zodiac sign?

704
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:04,446
-Ox.
-The Year of the Ox.

705
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,698
Ox is good.

706
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:10,035
Director Chan likes talking
with young people.

707
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,245
-I'll introduce you later.
-Thanks.

708
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:13,371
Really?

709
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:19,628
Director Chan told me
he hated the triads the most.

710
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,385
That's right, Superintendent Leung.

711
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,848
Mr. Ngai's been invited
to consult with the police.

712
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:34,476
Is that so? Congratulations!

713
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,103
Where do you golf these days, Chan?

714
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,773
-Zhongshan.
-Zhongshan? What's your handicap now?

715
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,108
How are you? My name's Ngai...

716
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,411
Mr. Ngai Wing-hau!

717
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,750
I'm Mr. Ngai's attorney.

718
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,294
This is a LAA reception
celebrating the handover.

719
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,004
Can we discuss this afterwards?

720
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:06,132
What if I say no?
Got any problem with that?

721
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:14,182
Mr. Ngai, we suspect you're related to
several murder cases in 1995.

722
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,143
Here's a warrant.

723
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,271
You're under arrest.

724
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:22,274
Everything you say will be recorded

725
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,401
and could be used as evidence against you.

726
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,444
Do you have any questions?

727
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,529
No.

728
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:44,671
I've looked through their charges.
The murder ones won't stick.

729
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,591
But your being a triad "Dragon Head"...

730
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:49,676
I can't help you with that.

731
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:53,513
The unions
and the political parties called.

732
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,557
They want to withdraw their invitations.

733
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,605
That was the HK and Macau Affairs Office.

734
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:04,733
-They have revoked your candidacy.
-Call Beijing.

735
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,485
-Get some friends to help.
-Let me try.

736
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,404
Forget it.

737
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,990
They even found a dead man
to testify against you.

738
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,993
Everyone knows how loyal Sam was to you.

739
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,329
Now he's a prosecution witness. It's over.

740
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,539
Sorry. Can't help you.

741
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,667
You said everything would be fine!

742
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,795
Everyone's watching how we will react.
What are you going to do?

743
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,882
What can I do?
Threaten the Chinese government?

744
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:30,842
That's not what he meant.

745
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:34,012
-We're all in the same boat.
-Time for me to get off then.

746
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,349
I may be your lawyer,
but I'm not one of you.

747
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,560
I don't wish to sink with you. Sorry.

748
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,323
Yes.

749
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,826
Sam has a wife and daughter in Thailand.

750
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:00,246
It's your call.

751
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:08,880
Sis.

752
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:14,469
You and the brothers should take Mom
and go to Hawaii for a while.

753
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:20,016
-Okay.
-Sure. Haven't been there for a while.

754
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:32,862
-Are you going to be all right?
-I'll be fine.

755
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:36,741
Sorry I can't help the family.

756
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:40,203
-You being OK is all that matters.
-Don't be silly. We're a family.

757
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,705
Take care of Mom.

758
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,416
Don't worry. Leave it to us three.

759
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:59,097
I kept thinking that,
even with my testimony,

760
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,268
Hau will only get a couple years.

761
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,229
True.

762
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,940
He'll have to whack you to get life.

763
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,992
I have to thank you.

764
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:22,787
Without you, I could never have
come back to Hong Kong.

765
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,752
Save it. I'm busy these days.

766
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,379
Anything you need, ask them.

767
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:33,214
They're here to protect you.

768
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,608
Sam?

769
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:56,488
Thanks.

770
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,742
So, how's it going?

771
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:04,287
Good, now that
I've been transferred to CIB.

772
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,290
I'll be an Inspector-in-Training
next month.

773
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:14,964
Did Mary call you...

774
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:17,675
before she died?

775
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,978
My condolences, Sam.

776
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:39,489
Inspector Wong said to find you
if I needed anything.

777
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,410
Will you really help me?

778
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,736
I thought you wouldn't come.

779
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,032
Why wouldn't 1?

780
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,591
Well?

781
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:23,885
It's been two years.

782
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:29,974
You didn't dare to call me for two years
because of my father's death?

783
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,559
You couldn't face me?

784
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:35,438
Right.

785
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:49,494
All of Hau's criminal evidence
is in the safe deposit box.

786
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:53,539
I've organised the files
according to dates.

787
01:35:58,044 --> 01:35:59,545
Why are you still helping me?

788
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,597
I'm not helping you.

789
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,226
I'm a cop.

790
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,938
I want to keep my promises to Officer Luk.

791
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:22,068
And I don't want to be a mole anymore.

792
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:26,531
Two more years, and I'll become
the top dog in Tsim Sha Tsui.

793
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,326
What for? To end up in prison?

794
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,336
I'll forget the past.

795
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:45,008
Just finish this case soon
and bring me back into the department.

796
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,094
And give me a nice desk.

797
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,722
Make sure it has an ocean view.

798
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,267
But don't let me see your face ever again.

799
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,148
Don't worry. You won't see me anymore.

800
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,692
One more thing.

801
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:08,031
I couldn't spell some of the words.
Come find me if you don't understand.

802
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,076
But don't mess up the order.
Took me forever.

803
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,620
I'll kill you if you do.

804
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:18,374
That'll be good. Put me out of misery.

805
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,252
You wish.

806
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:29,844
Thank you, Officer.

807
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:36,577
Sam? All set. The DOJ has scheduled
three days for the trial.

808
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:39,372
Mr. Hon...

809
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:40,433
Hello, OCTB.

810
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:46,647
Inspector Wong! Sam's disappeared.

811
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,247
He probably escaped through the kitchen.

812
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,041
Who was guarding the kitchen?

813
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,754
Sorry, sir.

814
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:15,426
Sir, Sam had made a call to Thailand
before he escaped.

815
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,931
Hello?

816
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:10,982
Mr. Ngai.

817
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:13,317
How can I help you?

818
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:16,529
You called me.

819
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,409
So you tell me how you can help me.

820
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:23,369
Am I right? Sit down.

821
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,132
Kill me.

822
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:41,053
Kill me, and everything's taken care of.

823
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:45,141
Why should 1?
Haven't done that kind of stuff for ages.

824
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:51,647
Everything can be negotiated, Sam.

825
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:55,610
Hong Kong's big enough for us both.

826
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,069
We can be partners if you want.

827
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,825
Let's forget about the past.

828
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,718
You will kill me.

829
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:23,888
You'll kill me tonight.

830
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:37,818
Then who's gonna take care of your family?

831
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:57,380
This just in.

832
01:42:57,463 --> 01:42:59,674
Hau has Sam's wife and daughter
as hostages.

833
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:03,094
That woman is his Thai maid.

834
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,481
I managed to stay alive all these years.

835
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:18,734
It's all because...

836
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:21,946
I have some good buddies in Thailand.

837
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:30,287
You want to take this call.

838
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:34,083
It's from Hawaii.

839
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,423
Your whole family's there.

840
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:44,218
My Thai buddies too.

841
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,373
Daddy? Where are you?

842
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:21,422
Mr. Ngai!

843
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:26,927
Shut up.

844
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,935
I told you. You'll kill me tonight.

845
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:33,202
Ngai Wing-hau! Drop the gun!

846
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:34,578
Let him, Wong!

847
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:38,499
He tried to kill me once before.

848
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:41,252
Let him do it again!

849
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,678
Officers!

850
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,598
Once he shoots me...

851
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:58,102
It's up to you to shoot him or not!

852
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:08,320
"What goes around comes around."

853
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:26,709
Two questions.

854
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:32,006
Did you Kill his whole family?

855
01:48:34,258 --> 01:48:35,509
Of course not.

856
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,931
My Thai friends and I were just bluffing.

857
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:46,103
Did you expect me to kill him for you?

858
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:56,905
If I said no, would you believe me?

859
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:58,991
I expected to die here!

860
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:02,453
It was my only way.

861
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:10,252
Sorry.

862
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:15,799
Did you know how much time I spent

863
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:18,218
collecting tons of evidence?

864
01:49:19,011 --> 01:49:20,679
Enough to put him away for life?

865
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:46,288
Hello, who's this?

866
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:48,040
It's the Thai guy, Sam.

867
01:49:53,295 --> 01:49:54,296
Paul?

868
01:49:55,297 --> 01:49:56,298
Thank you.

869
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:58,050
It's all good.

870
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:00,636
From now on, we're partners.

871
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:04,389
The shipment will go
straight to Hong Kong.

872
01:50:04,473 --> 01:50:08,852
The rest of the Ngai family...
Should I take care of them?

873
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,104
Paul...

874
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,900
Perhaps... we shouldn't go too far.

875
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:17,986
You're lucky to be alive

876
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:21,448
when you bumped into me.

877
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:23,700
We were destined to be partners

878
01:50:23,784 --> 01:50:26,120
when my shot didn't kill you.

879
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:28,247
There's no such thing as going too far.

880
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:00,863
The handover ceremony of Hong Kong
at the new convention centre

881
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:03,824
officially commenced at 11.20.

882
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,662
Both countries' military bands played
the respective anthems,

883
01:51:09,913 --> 01:51:13,917
as the British Union Jack flag
was gradually raised.

884
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:18,255
While the ceremony was solemn,

885
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:21,842
the atmosphere was harmonious
before it began.

886
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:25,429
During the playing of
the two military bands,

887
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:27,931
a few Chinese representatives
Started taking pictures.

888
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:34,104
Both Prince Charles and Governor Patten
were smiling as they entered the hall.

889
01:51:35,814 --> 01:51:38,192
The ceremony now officially begins.

890
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,820
Three British soldiers

891
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:45,449
and three flag-holding
Chinese PLA soldiers

892
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:48,202
march slowly onto the podium.

893
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:53,582
The People's Liberation Army present

894
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:56,668
the People's Republic of China flag
of the MCs.

895
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,505
Following them are,

896
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:03,300
three HK Royal Police officers,

897
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:08,430
together with three HK SAR police officers
as they all approach the podium.

898
01:52:11,099 --> 01:52:14,436
The three SAR officers present

899
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:17,022
the HKSAR flag to the MCs.

900
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:22,402
All the guests are now
rising from their seats.

901
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,990
July 1st has now arrived

902
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:28,951
as the clock strikes midnight.

903
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:32,162
The PRC flag slowly rises

904
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:34,915
together with the HKSAR flag...

905
01:52:37,209 --> 01:52:40,545
This marks the end of the colonial rule.

906
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:45,133
It also raises the curtains to the
historic "One Country, Two Systems" era.

907
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:48,345
The Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region

908
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:51,098
of the People's Republic of China
is now officially established.

909
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,021
It's okay. It's a done deal.

910
01:54:21,104 --> 01:54:22,606
Come join me.

911
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:25,025
You know what kind of boss is the worst?

912
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:27,110
The ugly kind!

913
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:29,237
Looks are important!
See how my greasy face glows?

914
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:36,578
What's your name, miss?

915
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:52,719
What's your name, miss?

916
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:55,680
Name...?

917
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:01,645
I'm Ma... Mary.

918
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:13,573
I think so...

919
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,891
CONTINUOUS HELL EMBODIES
3 COMPONENTS:

920
01:55:39,975 --> 01:55:42,477
UNINTERRUPTED TIME, UNLIMITED
SPACE, BOUNDLESS SUFFERING

921
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:45,313
TRANSGRESSORS OF THE FIVE DEADLY
SINS FALL INTO THIS HELL FOREVER

922
01:55:45,397 --> 01:55:47,607
CONDEMNED TO THE ULTIMATE
INCESSANT SUFFERING
