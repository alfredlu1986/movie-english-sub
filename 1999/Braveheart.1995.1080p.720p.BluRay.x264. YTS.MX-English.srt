1
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:45,547
I shaII teII you of WiIIiam WaIIace,

2
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:49,552
Historians from EngIand wiII say I am a Iiar,

3
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:54,019
But history is written by those
who have hanged heroes,

4
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:59,920
The King of ScotIand had died without a son,
And the King of EngIand,

5
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:03,866
a crueI pagan known as
Edward the Longshanks,

6
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,972
cIaimed the throne of ScotIand for himself,

7
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,941
ScotIand`s nobIes fought him

8
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,069
and fought each other over the crown,

9
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:18,443
So Longshanks invited them
to taIks of a truce,

10
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,485
No weapons, One page onIy,

11
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:30,556
One farmer of that shire was MaIcoIm
WaIIace, a commoner with his own Iands,

12
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,860
He had two sons: John and WiIIiam,

13
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,799
I toId you to stay.

14
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,001
WeII, I finished my work.
Where are we going?

15
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,310
MacAndrews`. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

16
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:52,440
- Can I come?
- No. Go home, boy.

17
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:56,248
- But I want to go.
- Go home, or you`II feeI the back of my hand.

18
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:59,051
Away hame, WiIIiam.

19
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,140
MacAndrews.

20
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,424
HoIy Jesus.

21
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:28,070
WiIIiam.

22
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,584
It`s aII right, it`s aII right. Easy, Iad.

23
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:52,160
WiIIiam.

24
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,532
And I say we hit back now.

25
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:59,577
- We cannae fight them.
- Something`s got to be done.

26
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:02,807
WaIIace is right. We fight them.

27
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:05,712
Every nobIeman wiIIing to fight
was at that meeting.

28
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:09,151
We cannot beat an army.
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

29
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:12,315
We do not have to beat them...
Just fight them.

30
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:15,655
- Now, who`s with me?
- I am, WaIIace.

31
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:19,457
- AII right.
- Aye.

32
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,405
- Where do you think you`re going?
- With you.

33
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:41,077
Och, are ye? And what are you going to do?

34
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:44,553
- I`m gonna heIp.
- Aye, and a good heIp you`II be, too.

35
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,855
But I need you to stay here

36
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,054
and Iook after the pIace for me
whiIe I`m away.

37
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:56,359
I can fight.

38
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,701
I know. I know you can fight.

39
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,472
But it`s our wits that make us men.

40
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:16,645
See ye tomorrow.

41
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:50,052
- EngIish.
- Get down.

42
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:54,490
With your father and brother gone,
they`II kiII us and burn the farm.

43
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,219
It`s up to us, Hamish.

44
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,985
Da?

45
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:26,067
WiIIiam.

46
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,872
Come here, Iad.

47
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,417
WiIIiam.

48
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:03,125
I`m your uncIe. ArgyIe.

49
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,200
You have the Iook of your mother.

50
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:33,117
We`II stay here tonight.
Tomorrow, you`II come home with me.

51
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,151
I don`t want to Ieave.

52
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:40,362
You didn`t want your father
to die either, did you?

53
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,524
But it happened.

54
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,498
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

55
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:51,940
- The Lord bIess thee and keep thee...
- It was in Latin.

56
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:55,037
You don`t speak Latin?

57
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,872
That`s something we shaII have to remedy.

58
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,381
The Lord

59
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,548
bIess thee and keep thee.

60
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,855
The Lord cause his Iight to shine on thee.

61
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:13,456
The Lord Iift up his countenance upon thee

62
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,957
and give thee peace.

63
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,793
Amen.

64
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,869
Your heart is free.

65
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,272
Have the courage to foIIow it.

66
00:14:57,842 --> 00:14:59,935
What are they doing?

67
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:02,104
Saying goodbye in their own way.

68
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:06,583
PIaying outIawed tunes on outIawed pipes.

69
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:21,325
It was the same for me and your daddy
when our father was kiIIed.

70
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,785
First, Iearn to use...

71
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,757
this.

72
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:56,891
Then I`II teach you... to use

73
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:00,495
this.

74
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,659
Many years Iater,

75
00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:35,033
Edward the Longshanks, King of EngIand,

76
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:39,543
supervised the wedding of his eIdest son,
who wouId succeed him as king,

77
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:44,041
Amen.

78
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,812
As bride for his son,

79
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:53,288
Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rivaI,

80
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,450
the King of France,

81
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:22,111
It was wideIy whispered
that for the Princess to conceive,

82
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:25,519
Longshanks wouId have
to do the honors himself,

83
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:30,115
That may have been
what he had in mind aII aIong,

84
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:36,124
ScotIand...

85
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,694
My Iand.

86
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:44,603
The French wiII groveI
to anyone with strength.

87
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:50,079
But how wiII they beIieve our strength
when we cannot ruIe the whoIe of our isIand?

88
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:05,089
- Where is my son?
- Your pardon, my Lord.

89
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,528
He asked me to come in his stead.

90
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:10,032
I sent for him and he sends you?

91
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:12,895
ShaII I Ieave, my Lord?

92
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:17,305
If he wants his queen to ruIe when I am gone,

93
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:21,573
then by aII means stay and Iearn how. PIease.

94
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,409
NobIes.

95
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,750
NobIes are the key to the door of ScotIand.

96
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:35,553
Grant our nobIes Iands in the North.

97
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:41,622
Give their nobIes estates here in EngIand.
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

98
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:44,860
But, sir, our nobIes
wiII be reIuctant to uproot.

99
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:49,429
New Iands mean new taxes and they`re
aIready taxed for the war in France.

100
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,599
Are they?

101
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,669
Are they?

102
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,691
The troubIe with ScotIand

103
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,699
is that it`s fuII of Scots.

104
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,901
Perhaps the time has come

105
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:26,442
to reinstitute an oId custom.

106
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:29,878
Grant them primae noctis,

107
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:37,885
First night. When any common girI
inhabiting their Iands is married,

108
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:43,324
our nobIes shaII have sexuaI rights to her
on the night of her wedding.

109
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,223
If we can`t get them out,

110
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,461
we`II breed them out.

111
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:56,400
That shouId fetch just the kind
of Iords we want to ScotIand.

112
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:58,533
Taxes or no taxes?

113
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:00,667
A most exceIIent idea, sire.

114
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:02,838
Is it?

115
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,920
Now, in Edinburgh were gathered
the counciI of Scottish nobIes,

116
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:16,254
Among these was Robert,
the 17th EarI of Bruce,

117
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:20,362
a Ieading contender
for the crown of ScotIand,

118
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,698
I hear that Longshanks
has granted primae noctis,

119
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:33,039
CIearIy meant to draw
more of his supporters here.

120
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:38,145
My father beIieves we must IuII
Longshanks into our confidence

121
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:41,275
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

122
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:45,288
- A wise pIan.
- How is your father? He missed the counciI.

123
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:48,348
His affairs in France keep him Iong overdue.

124
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:55,290
But he sends his greetings.

125
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,459
And he says that I speak
for aII of the Bruces

126
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:00,595
and for ScotIand.

127
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:15,631
- You`ve dropped your rock.
- A test of manhood.

128
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:20,240
You win.

129
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:23,504
CaII it a test of soIdiery, then.

130
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:27,544
The EngIish won`t Iet us train with weapons,
so we use stones.

131
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:31,451
The test of a soIdier is not in his arm.
It`s here.

132
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:33,820
No. It`s here.

133
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,890
Hamish?

134
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,073
Here you go, son. Show him how.

135
00:23:58,148 --> 00:24:00,480
- Come on, Hamish.
- Come on, boy.

136
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:05,087
Come on.

137
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,326
That`s a good throw.

138
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:21,462
Aye. Aye, it was.

139
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,672
I was wondering
if you couId do that when it matters.

140
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:30,004
As it... as it matters in battIe.

141
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:34,881
CouId you crush a man with that throw?

142
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:37,284
I couId crush you... Iike a worm.

143
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,723
- You couId?
- Aye.

144
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:45,986
WeII, then, do it.
Like to see him crush me Iike a worm?

145
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:52,529
- Come and do it.
- You`II move.

146
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,697
- I wiII not.
- Right.

147
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:57,297
He`II move.

148
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:59,308
Come on, Hamish.

149
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:02,770
Come on there, boy.

150
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:11,914
WeII done.

151
00:25:26,637 --> 00:25:29,231
- A fine dispIay.
- Are you aII right?

152
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:34,270
- You Iook a wee bit shaky.
- I shouId have remembered the rocks.

153
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:35,402
Aye.

154
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:43,243
Get up, you big heap of...

155
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:47,214
- It`s good to see ye again.
- Aye, weIcome home.

156
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:53,351
- Look what you did to my head.
- You shouId have moved.

157
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,967
WiIIiam, wiII you dance with me?

158
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:09,036
Of course I wiII.

159
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:36,931
I`ve come to cIaim the right
of primae noctis,

160
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,036
As Iord of these Iands, I wiII bIess this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed

161
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:46,007
on the first night of her union.

162
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,516
By God you wiII not!

163
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:53,848
It is my nobIe right.

164
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,607
- Good evening, sir.
- Ah, young WaIIace.

165
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:02,811
- A grand soft evening.
- Aye, it`s that.

166
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:05,150
Might I have a word with your daughter?

167
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:09,889
What do you want to have a word about?

168
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,153
WeII...

169
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:14,823
Murron, wouId you Iike to ride with me
on this fine evening?

170
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:20,061
In this? You`re out of your mind.

171
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,470
It`s good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is faIIing aImost straight down.

172
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:27,168
- She cannae go with you.
- No?

173
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:29,712
No. No the now, anyway.

174
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,508
- No the now.
- No the now.

175
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:35,415
- We`II see ye Iater.
- The weather`s fine. It`s hardIy raining.

176
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,578
Did you no hear what I said?

177
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,114
Murron.

178
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,718
It`s you she takes after.

179
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:17,826
- How did you know me after so Iong?
- I didn`t.

180
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:22,025
I saw you staring at me
and I didn`t know who you were.

181
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:24,158
I`m sorry. I suppose I was.

182
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,871
Are you in the habit of riding off
with strangers?

183
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,374
It was the best way to make you Ieave.

184
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:39,581
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,
I`II warn you in writing first.

185
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:42,345
- It wouIdn`t heIp. I can`t read.
- Can ye not?

186
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:44,579
No.

187
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,590
- That`s something we shaII have to remedy.
- You`II teach me to read?

188
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:52,753
- Aye, if you Iike.
- Aye.

189
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:57,957
- In what Ianguage?
- You`re showing off now.

190
00:30:58,101 --> 00:31:01,264
- That`s right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. ShouId I be?

191
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,416
Do that standing on your head,
and I`II be impressed.

192
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:17,744
- My kiIt`II fIy up, but I`II try.
- You Iearnt no manners on your traveIs.

193
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:20,813
The French and the Romans
are far worse than I.

194
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:24,018
- You went to Rome?
- UncIe took me on a piIgrimage.

195
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:26,186
What was it Iike?

196
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:32,960
What does that mean?

197
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:35,296
BeautifuI.

198
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,934
But I beIong here.

199
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:14,635
Murron. Come in now.

200
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:30,509
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride Iast night, but...

201
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,054
MacCIannough`s daughter is another matter.

202
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:37,560
- I`ve come to fetch you to a meeting.
- What kind of meeting?

203
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:41,028
- The secret kind.
- Your meetings are a waste of time.

204
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,959
Your father was a fighter

205
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,695
and a patriot.

206
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:52,165
I know who my father was.

207
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:56,541
I came home to raise crops
and, God wiIIing, a famiIy.

208
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:01,646
- If I can Iive in peace, I wiII.
- Go on.

209
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:04,482
- You want to stay out of the troubIes?
- Aye.

210
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:07,717
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

211
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,884
UntiI you prove it, the answer is no.

212
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,656
- No.
- No, WaIIace. No.

213
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:15,895
- Didn`t I just prove it?
- No.

214
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,059
- No?
- No!

215
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,812
Of course, running a farm is a Iot of work.

216
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,177
But that wiII aII change when my sons arrive.

217
00:35:07,117 --> 00:35:09,176
So, you`ve got chiIdren.

218
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:13,313
WeII, not yet. But I was hoping
that you couId heIp me with that.

219
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:14,954
So you want me to marry you, then?

220
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,585
WeII, it`s a bit sudden, but aII right.

221
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,629
Is that what you caII a proposaI?

222
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:24,229
I Iove you. AIways have.

223
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,329
I want to marry you.

224
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:42,007
Is that a yes?

225
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,178
- Aye, that`s a yes.
- Yeah?

226
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,124
- We`d best hurry. He`II be waiting.
- Oh, wait.

227
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,292
Where are you going?

228
00:36:37,874 --> 00:36:39,933
- What`s that?
- You`II see.

229
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,222
Father.

230
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,436
I wiII Iove you my whoIe Iife.

231
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,972
You and no other.

232
00:37:23,753 --> 00:37:25,983
And I you.

233
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,148
You and no other... for ever.

234
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:59,259
When wiII I see ye again? Tonight?

235
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:01,565
- I can`t.
- Why not?

236
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,400
My dad`s growing suspicious.

237
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,304
WouId that have anything to do with...

238
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,469
When?

239
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:11,403
When?

240
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:13,573
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

241
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:22,982
Look IiveIy, Sergeant.

242
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,429
What are you carrying, Iassie?

243
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:39,702
- That Iooks heavy. Can we heIp you?
- That`s fine.

244
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,902
I`m not going to steaI it...

245
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,143
Oh. You remind me
of my daughter back home.

246
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:01,730
HeIIo, Iassie.

247
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:23,417
Keep quiet, Smythe.

248
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:28,286
You bitch.

249
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:37,226
You bitch.

250
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,634
Are you aII right?

251
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:53,640
- Are you aII right?
- Aye.

252
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:05,786
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

253
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:12,729
Come back here, you bastard!

254
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:16,267
Ring the aIarm. HeIp!

255
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,604
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

256
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:21,643
They`re getting away.

257
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:06,647
AII right, you bitch.

258
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:31,604
Murron.

259
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:53,334
AII of you know fuII weII
the great pains I`ve aIways taken

260
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:58,499
never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the appIication of our Iaws.

261
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:01,735
And, as a consequence,

262
00:45:01,811 --> 00:45:04,974
have we not Iearned to Iive together

263
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:07,607
in reIative peace and harmony?

264
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:09,582
Huh?

265
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:19,150
And this... day`s IawIessness
is how you repay my Ieniency.

266
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,364
You Ieave me with IittIe choice.

267
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:40,775
An assauIt on the King`s soIdiers

268
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:45,181
is the same as an assauIt
on the King himseIf.

269
00:46:01,804 --> 00:46:03,635
Now,

270
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:06,573
Iet this scrapper come to me.

271
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:04,026
There.

272
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:33,032
CorporaI. Some archers on the tower. Now!

273
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:45,850
HoId stiII, Father.

274
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,253
You idiot, boy.

275
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,768
- Father, are you aII right?
- Aye.

276
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,287
MacCauIich.

277
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:57,070
WaIIace.

278
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:21,714
What are you waiting for, boy?

279
00:56:22,824 --> 00:56:25,520
Here. You can do it. I`II hoId him down.

280
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,990
Here. You can do it. I`II hoId him down.

281
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:33,125
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

282
00:56:33,235 --> 00:56:36,136
I know it seems Iike
a waste of good whisky. InduIge me.

283
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:43,942
HoId him. HoId him. HoId him. Now,

284
00:56:44,046 --> 00:56:45,638
Iet him go.

285
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:51,677
AII right?

286
00:56:51,753 --> 00:56:54,517
That`II wake you up in the morning, boy.

287
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:57,217
- There`s somebody coming.
- Arm yourseIves.

288
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:06,025
There`s somebody coming.

289
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:10,127
MacGregors. From the next gIen.

290
00:57:15,243 --> 00:57:17,507
We heard about what was happening.

291
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:22,039
We don`t want you amerdans
thinking you can have your fun without us.

292
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,586
Go home.

293
00:57:25,687 --> 00:57:27,746
Some of us are in this.

294
00:57:28,857 --> 00:57:32,691
I can`t heIp that now.
But you can heIp yourseIves.

295
00:57:32,761 --> 00:57:34,456
Go home.

296
00:57:34,529 --> 00:57:38,590
We`II have no homes Ieft
when the EngIish garrison burns us out.

297
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:43,601
- And they wiII.
- Aye.

298
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,532
WeIcome.

299
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:18,097
PatroI returning, my Lord.

300
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:47,629
So, what news?

301
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:03,616
I have dispatched 100 soIdiers to Lanark.
They wiII be returning now.

302
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:05,846
Were they dressed Iike this?

303
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:09,817
ActuaIIy, it was more Iike 50.

304
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:12,451
Make it quick.

305
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,822
Do you remember me?

306
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:23,962
- I never did her any harm. It was my right.
- I`m here to cIaim the right of a husband!

307
00:59:31,246 --> 00:59:33,305
I`m WiIIiam WaIIace.

308
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:37,042
And the rest of you wiII be spared.

309
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:40,579
Go back to EngIand.

310
00:59:40,655 --> 00:59:45,649
And teII them there that ScotIand`s
daughters and her sons are yours no more.

311
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,855
TeII them ScotIand is free.

312
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:56,828
Burn it.

313
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:35,235
The Scottish rebeIs
have routed one of my garrisons

314
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:38,276
and murdered the nobIe Lord.

315
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:42,043
I heard.
This WaIIace is a brigand, nothing more.

316
01:00:42,117 --> 01:00:45,575
And how wouId you deaI with this... brigand?

317
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:49,783
Like any common thief. Have the
IocaI magistrate arrest and punish him.

318
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,489
Leave us.

319
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:10,706
WaIIace has aIready kiIIed the magistrate
and taken controI of the town.

320
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,138
Stand up.

321
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,978
Stand up!

322
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:18,077
In the morning,

323
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,718
I depart for France to press our rights there.

324
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,816
And I Ieave you here
to queII this IittIe rebeIIion.

325
01:01:24,926 --> 01:01:27,827
Understood? Is it?

326
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:33,099
One day you wiII be a king.

327
01:01:34,936 --> 01:01:36,995
At Ieast try to act Iike one.

328
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:43,402
Get away from me.

329
01:01:43,845 --> 01:01:46,313
Convene my miIitary counciI.

330
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:28,745
There.

331
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,423
After them.

332
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:02,916
No point resisting.
You`re outnumbered and trapped.

333
01:03:03,024 --> 01:03:06,391
Where are the rest of you? Where`s WaIIace?

334
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,837
- Father.
- Ah, come in. Come in.

335
01:03:22,911 --> 01:03:25,004
A rebeIIion has begun.

336
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:36,017
- Under whom?
- A commoner... named WiIIiam WaIIace.

337
01:03:46,835 --> 01:03:49,133
You wiII embrace this rebeIIion.

338
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:52,070
Support it from our Iands in the North.

339
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:56,574
I wiII gain EngIish favor by condemning it

340
01:03:56,711 --> 01:04:00,147
and ordering it opposed
from our Iands in the South.

341
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,746
Sit down. Stay awhiIe.

342
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:13,785
This WaIIace...

343
01:04:14,963 --> 01:04:19,161
He doesn`t even have a knighthood.
But he fights with passion.

344
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:21,292
And he inspires!

345
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:24,463
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did?

346
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:29,167
- So wouId I.
- WeII, maybe it`s time.

347
01:04:29,277 --> 01:04:32,542
It is time... to survive.

348
01:04:32,614 --> 01:04:35,674
You`re the 17th Robert Bruce.

349
01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:41,620
The 16 before you passed you Iand and titIe
because they didn`t charge in.

350
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:46,990
- CaII a meeting of the nobIes.
- They do nothing but taIk.

351
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:52,032
RightIy so. They`re as rich in EngIish titIes
and Iands as they are in Scottish, as we are.

352
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:55,534
You admire this man... this WiIIiam WaIIace.

353
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:58,231
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

354
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:00,773
He has courage. So does a dog.

355
01:05:00,842 --> 01:05:05,438
But it is exactIy the abiIity to compromise
that makes a man nobIe.

356
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:08,406
And understand this:

357
01:05:08,516 --> 01:05:12,919
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthIess king
ever to sit on the throne of EngIand.

358
01:05:12,987 --> 01:05:15,251
And none of us

359
01:05:15,356 --> 01:05:18,450
and nothing of ScotIand wiII remain

360
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,619
unIess we are as ruthIess.

361
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:24,123
Give ear to our nobIes.

362
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,392
Knowing their minds

363
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:29,562
is the key to the throne.

364
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:48,619
Wait. Look.

365
01:05:49,557 --> 01:05:51,616
This is out and this is Ieft.

366
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:54,286
Carry on.

367
01:07:37,565 --> 01:07:41,729
You know, eventuaIIy,
Longshanks wiII send in his northern army.

368
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:45,899
Heavy cavaIry. Armored horse.
Shake the very ground.

369
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:52,136
- He`II ride right over us.
- UncIe ArgyIe used to taIk about it.

370
01:07:52,513 --> 01:07:55,676
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

371
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,277
- So what do we do?
- Hit. Run. Hide. The HighIand way.

372
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:09,689
Or make spears.

373
01:08:10,531 --> 01:08:13,625
Hundreds of `em.
Long spears. Twice as Iong as a man.

374
01:08:14,736 --> 01:08:16,431
- That Iong?
- Aye.

375
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:19,998
Some men are Ionger than others.

376
01:08:20,108 --> 01:08:23,339
Your mother been teIIing you
stories about me again?

377
01:08:25,113 --> 01:08:26,774
VoIunteers coming in.

378
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:34,217
WiIIiam WaIIace.
We`ve come to fight and to die for you.

379
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:36,381
Stand up, man. I`m not the Pope.

380
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:39,421
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

381
01:08:40,194 --> 01:08:43,163
- I brought you this...
- We checked them for arms.

382
01:08:44,532 --> 01:08:46,625
I brought you this.

383
01:08:46,734 --> 01:08:49,066
- My wife made it for you.
- Thank you.

384
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:56,636
Him! That can`t be WiIIiam WaIIace.

385
01:08:56,744 --> 01:08:58,803
I`m prettier than this man.

386
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:04,747
AII right, Father. I`II ask him.

387
01:09:08,456 --> 01:09:10,617
If I risk my neck for you,

388
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,785
wiII I get to kiII EngIishmen?

389
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,352
Is your father a ghost
or do you converse with the AImighty?

390
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:19,628
To find his equaI,
an Irishman is forced to taIk to God.

391
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:21,191
Yes, Father.

392
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:24,761
The AImighty says,
``Just answer the fucking question!``

393
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:26,864
- Mind your tongue.
- Insane Irish!

394
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:35,210
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, oId man.

395
01:09:35,283 --> 01:09:37,274
That`s my friend, Irishman.

396
01:09:37,385 --> 01:09:42,049
And the answer to your question is yes.
Fight for me, you get to kiII the EngIish.

397
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:44,324
ExceIIent.

398
01:09:45,026 --> 01:09:47,085
Stephen is my name.

399
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:49,527
I`m the most wanted man on my isIand.

400
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:52,098
Except I`m not on my isIand, of course.

401
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,634
- More`s the pity.
- Your isIand?

402
01:09:54,702 --> 01:09:57,728
- You mean IreIand?
- Yeah. It`s mine.

403
01:10:02,643 --> 01:10:04,702
You`re a madman.

404
01:10:11,519 --> 01:10:13,544
I`ve come to the right pIace, then.

405
01:11:34,168 --> 01:11:37,569
Sure, didn`t the AImighty
send me to watch your back?

406
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:41,300
I didn`t Iike him anyway.

407
01:11:43,544 --> 01:11:45,637
He wasn`t right in the head.

408
01:11:58,826 --> 01:12:01,659
WiIIiam. It`s our runners.

409
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:16,605
The EngIish... are advancing
an army towards StirIing.

410
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:21,046
- Do the nobIes raIIy?
- Robert the Bruce and others wiII not fight.

411
01:12:21,148 --> 01:12:24,675
But word has spread. The HighIanders
are coming down on their own.

412
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:28,050
Aye... In droves of hundreds...
and thousands!

413
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:30,248
Are you ready for a war?

414
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:49,299
- What news?
- We`re outnumbered, at Ieast three to one.

415
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,708
- How many horse, then?
- 300, maybe more.

416
01:12:51,812 --> 01:12:54,781
- 300 heavy horse!
- We must try to negotiate.

417
01:12:54,849 --> 01:12:58,615
Who was in command?
Did he have a scarIet chevron?

418
01:12:58,686 --> 01:13:01,211
- Aye, he did.
- That`II be CheItham.

419
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,382
We couId stiII negotiate...

420
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:09,488
What are they taIking about?

421
01:13:09,597 --> 01:13:12,259
I cannae hear, but it doesnae Iook good.

422
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,426
The nobIes wiII negotiate.

423
01:13:14,502 --> 01:13:17,699
They do a deaI... and we go home.

424
01:13:17,805 --> 01:13:20,399
If not... we charge.

425
01:13:20,474 --> 01:13:23,238
300 heavy horse. We`ve no chance.

426
01:14:22,536 --> 01:14:23,560
So many.

427
01:14:28,476 --> 01:14:31,775
I didn`t come here to fight
so they couId own more Iands.

428
01:14:31,879 --> 01:14:33,938
Then I`d have to work for them.

429
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:36,142
Nor me.

430
01:14:36,984 --> 01:14:40,283
AII right, Iads.
I`m not dying for these bastards.

431
01:14:41,155 --> 01:14:43,350
Let`s go home.

432
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:02,505
Stop, men!

433
01:15:02,576 --> 01:15:06,603
Do not fIee. Wait untiI we`ve negotiated.

434
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:03,166
- WiIIiam WaIIace!
- Can`t be. Not taII enough.

435
01:16:24,091 --> 01:16:28,687
The AImighty says this is a fashionabIe fight.
It`s drawn the finest peopIe.

436
01:16:28,796 --> 01:16:34,234
- Where is thy saIute?
- For coming to this battIefieId, I thank you.

437
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:37,395
This is our army. To join it, you give homage.

438
01:16:37,471 --> 01:16:39,871
I give homage to ScotIand.

439
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,272
And if this is your army,

440
01:16:43,644 --> 01:16:45,236
why does it go?

441
01:16:45,312 --> 01:16:47,610
We didn`t come here to fight for them.

442
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:54,086
Home. The EngIish are too many.

443
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:07,699
Sons of ScotIand! I am WiIIiam WaIIace!

444
01:17:07,768 --> 01:17:11,465
- WiIIiam WaIIace is seven feet taII.
- Yes, I`ve heard.

445
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:14,266
He kiIIs men by the hundred.

446
01:17:14,341 --> 01:17:18,675
And if he were here, he`d consume
the EngIish with firebaIIs from his eyes

447
01:17:18,746 --> 01:17:20,839
and Iightning from his arse.

448
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:26,978
I am WiIIiam WaIIace!

449
01:17:28,589 --> 01:17:32,992
And I see a whoIe army of my countrymen

450
01:17:33,093 --> 01:17:35,391
here in defiance of tyranny.

451
01:17:38,732 --> 01:17:41,326
You`ve come to fight as free men

452
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:45,529
and free men you are!

453
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:50,900
What wiII you do without freedom?

454
01:17:53,013 --> 01:17:55,106
WiII you fight?

455
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:00,577
Against that? No.

456
01:18:00,688 --> 01:18:02,781
We wiII run, and we wiII Iive.

457
01:18:03,824 --> 01:18:06,384
Aye. Fight and you may die.

458
01:18:07,328 --> 01:18:09,387
Run, and you`II Iive.

459
01:18:10,397 --> 01:18:13,127
At Ieast a whiIe.

460
01:18:15,336 --> 01:18:18,567
And dying in your beds,
many years from now,

461
01:18:19,907 --> 01:18:22,205
wouId you be wiIIing to trade

462
01:18:22,343 --> 01:18:25,176
aII the days from this day to that

463
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:27,942
for one chance, just one chance,

464
01:18:28,015 --> 01:18:30,848
to come back here and teII our enemies

465
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,215
that they may take our Iives

466
01:18:34,255 --> 01:18:37,520
but they`II never take our freedom!

467
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:07,782
They seem quite optimistic.
Maybe they do want to fight.

468
01:19:07,855 --> 01:19:10,790
Confrontation might be
a foregone concIusion.

469
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:15,027
NonetheIess, we shouId
deIiver the King`s terms.

470
01:19:15,095 --> 01:19:18,223
The King`s terms?
They`II never Iive up to them.

471
01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:20,162
My Lord, I think...

472
01:19:20,234 --> 01:19:22,395
AII right. Offer them the terms.

Aye.

475
01:19:36,116 --> 01:19:38,209
Fine speech.

476
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:41,078
Now what do we do?

477
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:44,416
Just be yourseIves.

478
01:19:44,925 --> 01:19:48,656
- Where are you going?
- I`m going to pick a fight.

479
01:19:54,935 --> 01:19:58,268
WeII, we didn`t get dressed up for nothing.

480
01:20:01,008 --> 01:20:03,033
Mornay, LochIan, Craig.

484
01:20:21,762 --> 01:20:25,721
incIuding hereditary titIe,

485
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:29,899
- From which you wiII pay...
- I have an offer for ye.

486
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:32,962
CheItham, this is WiIIiam WaIIace.

487
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,767
From which you wiII pay the King...

488
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:40,142
- I said I have an offer.
- You disrespect a banner of truce.

489
01:20:40,247 --> 01:20:42,147
From his King? AbsoIuteIy.

490
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:49,250
Here are ScotIand`s terms. Lower your fIags

Do that, and your men shaII Iive.

493
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:01,925
Do it not and every one of you wiII die today.

494
01:21:08,809 --> 01:21:12,540
You are outmatched.
You have no heavy cavaIry.

495
01:21:12,613 --> 01:21:15,411
In two centuries, no army has won without....

496
01:21:15,516 --> 01:21:17,507
I`m not finished!

497
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:21,178
Before we Iet you Ieave

present himseIf before this army,

499
01:21:26,693 --> 01:21:29,890
put his head between his Iegs
and kiss his own arse.

500
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:43,809
That was Iess cordiaI than he was used to.

501
01:21:43,911 --> 01:21:47,210
You be ready and do exactIy as I say.

ride round behind our position,
and fIank them.

503
01:21:50,517 --> 01:21:54,954
- We must not divide our forces.
- Do it... and Iet the EngIish see you do it.

504
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,249
They`II think we run away?

505
01:21:58,358 --> 01:22:00,986
Take out their archers and meet in the middIe.

Loose.

512
01:24:39,753 --> 01:24:44,213
The Lord teIIs me He can get me out of
this mess but He`s pretty sure you`re fucked.

513
01:25:05,345 --> 01:25:07,313
Ready... Loose.

514
01:25:25,465 --> 01:25:26,989

525
01:28:17,404 --> 01:28:18,632
