00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,458
You know, you can tell me things
If you need to.

166
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,052
Well, you know
what I did today?

167
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:55,184
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

168
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:57,187
I quit my jobs,

169
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:02,234
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

170
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:05,698
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

171
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,700
What'd you do?

172
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,586
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

173
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:18,588
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

174
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:22,717
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

175
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,643
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

176
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,688
You got an hour.

177
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,698
[Malcolm] Hi.

178
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,081
Wanna sit?

179
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,922
Don't feel like
talking today?

180
00:21:58,677 --> 00:22:00,638
Wanna play a game?

181
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,600
It's a mind- reading game.

182
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:06,687
Here's how it works.

183
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:09,190
I read your mind.

184
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:12,568
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

185
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:16,658
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

186
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,660
towards the doorway.

187
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:22,330
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

188
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:26,253
If you reach the door,
you can go.

189
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,756
Wanna play?

190
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:38,935
Okay.

191
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:58,041
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

192
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:02,421
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

193
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:05,634
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

194
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:26,326
You're worried that she said
she told him things--

195
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:28,703
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

196
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:31,998
Secrets.

197
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:41,468
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

198
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:58,906
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

199
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,172
He forgot it in a drawer.

200
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:14,174
Doesn't work.

201
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:29,652
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

202
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:34,532
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

203
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,835
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

204
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:46,047
Anything we wanted.

205
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:51,970
I drew a man.

206
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:55,015
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

207
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:01,398
You saw that on TV, Cole?

208
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,400
[Footsteps]

209
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:07,322
Everyone got upset.

210
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,201
They had a meeting.

211
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,203
Mom started crying.

212
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:15,791
I don't draw
like that anymore.

213
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:20,004
How do you draw now?

214
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:25,636
I draw... people smiling,

215
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,722
dogs running,

216
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,100
rainbows.

217
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,398
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

218
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:39,778
No. I guess they don't.

219
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,250
What am I thinking now?

220
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:54,879
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

221
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,056
I was thinking...

222
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:05,100
you're nice,

223
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,606
but you can't help me.

[Sighs]

225
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,797
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

226
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,889
[Sighs]

227
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:38,891
I'm so sorry, Anna.

228
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,979
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

229
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,653
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

230
00:26:53,032 --> 00:26:55,912
They're both so similar.

231
00:26:55,996 --> 00:27:00,375
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

232
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:06,300
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

233
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:10,804
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

234
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,473
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

235
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,895
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

236
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:20,858
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

237
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:25,698
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

238
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,079
Or I could just be wrong.

239
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:34,208
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

240
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:44,845
[Sighs]
Anna.

241
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,227
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

242
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,480
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

243
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:56,611
feel like I'm being given
a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.

I don't like when people
look at me like that.

- [Children Chattering]

250
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:25,186
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

251
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,231
Is he your best buddy?

No.

set that up?

Yes.

Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

259
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,882
'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

Hey.

You are not a freak.
Okay?

264
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:06,320
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

265
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,780
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

266
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:12,410
Okay?

Think she just holds it?

I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

277
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:52,823
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

278
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:55,117
How come?

279
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:58,956
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

280
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,170
to express our feelings
about certain issues--

281
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:07,633
divorce, whatever.

282
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:11,429
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

283
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,521
Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

284
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,858
[Cole] No.

285
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:26,198
[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

286
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:31,661
and you put the pencil to apiece
of paper and you start writing.

287
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:34,456
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

288
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:37,878
You just keep
Your hand moving.

289
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:41,924
And after a while, if you keep
Your hand moving long enough,

290
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:45,429
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

291
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:50,935
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

292
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:54,313
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:52,733
Once upon a time
there was this young prince,

478
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:57,489
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

479
00:46:57,573 --> 00:47:02,661
He go this driver,
and they started driving.

480
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:05,791
Driving, driving.

481
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:08,336
[Sighs]
Driving a lot.

482
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:11,005
And, uh,

483
00:47:11,047 --> 00:47:14,717
they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

484
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,721
And--

485
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:23,853
Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

486
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:26,274
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

487
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:30,780
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

488
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:33,074
Uh, not too many, no.

489
00:47:33,157 --> 00:47:35,620
You have to add
some twists and stuff.

490
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:39,540
Okay. Some twists.

491
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:44,462
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

492
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:49,803
- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?

493
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:52,972
That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so--

494
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:55,434
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

495
00:47:58,438 --> 00:48:00,357
You think I'm sad?

496
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:05,278
What makes you think that?

about stuff like that.

Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

500
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:30,893
He worked with children.

501
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,064
He loved it.

502
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:38,111
He loved it
more than anything else.

503
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,574
And then one night,
he found out that...

504
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:45,829
he made a mistake
with one of them.

505
00:48:45,912 --> 00:48:48,498
He couldn't help that one.

506
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:52,711
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

507
00:48:52,753 --> 00:48:55,046
He can't forget.

508
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,554
Ever since then,
things have been different.

509
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,310
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

510
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:09,356
And his wife...

511
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,153
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

512
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:15,824
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

513
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:22,956
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

514
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,712
A really cool little boy.

515
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:29,340
Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

516
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:35,137
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

517
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:41,813
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

518
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:46,611
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

You need to leave the table.

637
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:10,707
Go!

If you're not
very mad,

646
01:03:58,723 --> 01:04:01,309
can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

647
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:05,731
Look at my face.

Oh, please.

[Sobbing]
Oh.

654
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:42,109
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

655
01:04:42,151 --> 01:04:47,241
with mine- cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

656

[Clears Throat]

659
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,795
got anything
a little plainer?

660
01:04:57,837 --> 01:05:02,592
Plainer? You want a plain ring
to go with your plain fiance?
Is that how it is?

661
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:06,556
No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

662
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:13,438
Uh--
You're so beautiful.

663
01:05:13,521 --> 01:05:17,235
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

664
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:20,155
- You don't need all that.
- Uh- huh.

Why don't you
try it on...

666
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:25,035
and see how you both
feel about it.

667
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:33,837
There. How does
that feel?

668
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:38,219
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

669
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,305
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

670
01:05:41,389 --> 01:05:44,475
loved a man that she
couldn't be with.

671
01:05:45,937 --> 01:05:49,107
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

672
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:53,278
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

673
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:56,325
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

674
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:59,829
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

675
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:06,087
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

676
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:09,632
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

677
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:13,428
like...
like fingerprints.

678
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,600
I'll just
wrap it up.

679
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,778
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

680
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:29,614
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

681
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:32,868
[Chuckles]
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

- Happy birthday.

- No.

I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

The way we used to
talk to each other.

696
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:36,571

in the world except us.

[Cole] How are you gonna do that?

anymore.

I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

who can help me, I know it.

Dr. Crowe, you believe
my secret, right?

709

I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

"Yo no quiero morir" means?

753

It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die. "

What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

think about it, Cole.

they want?

- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.

01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:38,329
She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

794
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:42,499
I guess she did.

795
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:19,295
[Sobbing]

796
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,600
Can you get
some water?

797
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,400
That's her sister.

798
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:58,592
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer--

799
01:19:58,634 --> 01:20:01,929
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

800
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:04,557
[Woman] How many--
How many doctors?

801
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,562
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

802
01:20:07,645 --> 01:20:10,023
I think so, yes.

803
01:20:15,863 --> 01:20:20,326
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

804
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:22,746
God help them.

805
01:20:42,227 --> 01:20:44,730
Don't go home,
okay?

806
01:20:44,813 --> 01:20:47,276
I definitely won't.

807
01:21:42,509 --> 01:21:45,178
Aah!
[Panting]

808
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,089
Mister?

809
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:53,470
Excuse me, mister.

810
01:22:57,768 --> 01:23:00,270
Are you
Kyra's daddy?

811
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:17,333
It's for you.

812
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:20,503
Sh- She wanted
to tell you something.

813
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:56,338
[Static]

814
01:23:58,507 --> 01:24:01,093
[Kyra's Voice] Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

815
01:24:05,724 --> 01:24:08,644
Would you like to dance?

816
01:24:08,686 --> 01:24:12,691
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

817
01:24:12,774 --> 01:24:15,235
Oh, well,
how about this?

818
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:18,741
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

819
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:20,784
you can kick me.

820
01:24:20,868 --> 01:24:22,911
Oh, okay then.

821
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:21,399
[Liquid Pouring]

822
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,209
[Woman] It's time for lunch, Kyra.

823
01:25:40,338 --> 01:25:43,049
- [Kyra] I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

824
01:25:43,133 --> 01:25:45,427
[Kisses]
It's time for your food.

825
01:25:47,389 --> 01:25:49,683
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

826
01:25:49,724 --> 01:25:52,145
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

827
01:25:52,186 --> 01:25:54,981
We'll see.

828
01:25:56,609 --> 01:26:00,488
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

829
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:07,456
Tami's mom called.

830
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:25,267
You were
keeping her sick.

831
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:44,832
You liked it,
she said.

832
01:26:47,837 --> 01:26:50,924
She looked out
for you.

833
01:26:51,007 --> 01:26:53,301
Is Kyra coming back?

834
01:26:56,431 --> 01:26:59,351
[Cole] Not anymore.

835
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,654
[Woman] I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

836
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:11,323
[Cole] Okay.

837
01:27:11,406 --> 01:27:15,077
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!

838
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:20,876
Who, uh--
Who were you talking to?

839
01:27:27,718 --> 01:27:30,805
Just practicing
my lines.

840
01:27:33,934 --> 01:27:36,730
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

841
01:27:36,814 --> 01:27:40,568
You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.

842
01:27:40,651 --> 01:27:42,653
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

843
01:27:42,736 --> 01:27:45,657
Yeah, I know.

844
01:27:47,201 --> 01:27:49,954
[Audience Sighing]

845
01:27:55,836 --> 01:28:00,758
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

846
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,428
Let the boy try.

847
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:07,601
[Scattered Applause]

848
01:28:10,604 --> 01:28:13,648
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

849
01:28:13,732 --> 01:28:16,486
- Silence, village idiot.
- [Scattered Giggling]

850
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,364
Let the boy
step forward.

Hail, King Arthur!

[Applause]

854
01:28:54,364 --> 01:28:56,284
[Children] Yea!

[Chattering]

859
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:24,651
[Malcolm] I thought you were
really great in the play, Cole.

860
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,863
- Really?
- Yeah.

861
01:29:26,947 --> 01:29:29,366
- You know what else?
- What?

862
01:29:29,449 --> 01:29:33,870
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time. [Chuckles]

[Chuckles]

864
01:29:41,088 --> 01:29:44,466
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

865
01:29:44,508 --> 01:29:47,805
Wait till
she's asleep.

866
01:29:47,847 --> 01:29:51,392
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

867
01:29:58,735 --> 01:30:01,946
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?

868
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,911
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

869
01:30:08,413 --> 01:30:11,416
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

870
01:30:13,418 --> 01:30:16,506
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

871
01:30:18,842 --> 01:30:21,178
Just for pretend.

872
01:30:27,436 --> 01:30:29,813
Okay.

873
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:36,489
I'm gonna go now.

874
01:30:42,578 --> 01:30:44,914
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

- [Siren Blaring]
- [Chattering, Indistinct]

876
01:31:12,114 --> 01:31:15,661
I'm okay, Officer.
I- I'm okay.

877
01:31:15,744 --> 01:31:17,997
I don't know
what happened.

878
01:31:23,336 --> 01:31:26,258
[Lynn] Hmm.

879
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:29,469
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

880
01:31:32,681 --> 01:31:35,810
You're very quiet.

881
01:31:35,893 --> 01:31:39,189
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

882
01:31:39,273 --> 01:31:41,650
I have two jobs, baby.

883
01:31:41,733 --> 01:31:44,695
You know how important
they are for us.

884

[Sighs]

885
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:49,201
I'd give anything
to have been there.

886
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,384
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

887
01:32:08,641 --> 01:32:10,685
Communicate?

888
01:32:12,228 --> 01:32:14,606
Tell you my secrets.

889
01:32:16,192 --> 01:32:18,653
What is it?

890
01:32:22,407 --> 01:32:25,201
You know the accident
up there?

891
01:32:25,285 --> 01:32:28,290
Yeah.

892
01:32:28,373 --> 01:32:30,459
Someone got hurt.

893
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:32,754
They did?

894
01:32:32,837 --> 01:32:36,343
A lady.

895
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,720
She died.

896
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:41,222
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

897
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,770
- Yes.
- Where is she?

898
01:32:49,316 --> 01:32:53,236
Standing next to
my window.

899
01:32:59,328 --> 01:33:02,289
Cole, you're
scaring me.

900
01:33:02,373 --> 01:33:04,667
They scare me too
sometimes.

901
01:33:07,296 --> 01:33:09,590
They?

902
01:33:12,468 --> 01:33:14,387
Ghosts.

903
01:33:18,768 --> 01:33:21,229
You see ghosts, Cole?

904
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:26,277
They want me to
do things for them.

905
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:31,241
They--
They talk to you?

906
01:33:31,282 --> 01:33:34,411
They tell you
to do things?

907
01:33:35,495 --> 01:33:38,417
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

908
01:33:39,918 --> 01:33:42,713
What are you
thinking, Mama?

909
01:33:42,754 --> 01:33:47,386
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

910
01:33:47,469 --> 01:33:50,431
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

911
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:54,184
- Got it?
- Got it.

912
01:34:01,527 --> 01:34:03,571
Just let me think
for a minute.

913
01:34:07,452 --> 01:34:09,537
Grandma says hi.

914
01:34:13,042 --> 01:34:16,172
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

915
01:34:16,255 --> 01:34:18,924
She just
likes it a lot.

916
01:34:21,385 --> 01:34:25,264
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

917
01:34:27,685 --> 01:34:30,438
Cole, that's
very wrong.

918
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:33,066
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

919
01:34:33,149 --> 01:34:36,488
- She wanted me to tell you--
- Cole, please stop.

920
01:34:36,529 --> 01:34:39,324
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

921
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:44,579
She said
when you were little,

922
01:34:44,662 --> 01:34:46,583
you and her
had a fight...

923
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:49,419
right before
your dance recital.

924
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:56,386
- [Sniffles]
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

925
01:35:00,224 --> 01:35:02,601
She did.

926
01:35:07,942 --> 01:35:11,779
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

927
01:35:11,821 --> 01:35:14,657
Sh- She said you were
like an angel.

928
01:35:19,288 --> 01:35:21,415
- [Sobbing]
- She said...

929
01:35:21,457 --> 01:35:24,961
you came to the place
where they buried her,

930
01:35:27,173 --> 01:35:29,634
asked her a question.

931
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:36,518
She said
the answer is...

932
01:35:36,601 --> 01:35:38,520
every day.

933
01:35:41,106 --> 01:35:43,608

Do I make her proud?

[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

942
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:38,134
I'm not
used to doing this,

943
01:36:38,218 --> 01:36:41,846
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

944
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,060
I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]

945
01:36:46,143 --> 01:36:48,355
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

946
01:36:48,438 --> 01:36:51,274
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

947
01:36:51,358 --> 01:36:54,152
It's bitter sweet almost,
for me,

948
01:36:54,236 --> 01:36:56,448
'cause I hate
giving her up.

949
01:36:56,531 --> 01:36:58,659
[Malcolm] Anna?

950
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:02,496
[Applause On Television]

951
01:37:08,504 --> 01:37:10,464
I miss you.

952
01:37:16,347 --> 01:37:18,933
I miss you too.

953
01:37:19,016 --> 01:37:21,811
Why, Malcolm?

954
01:37:21,894 --> 01:37:24,647
What?

955
01:37:26,442 --> 01:37:30,071
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

956
01:37:30,113 --> 01:37:33,450
I didn't leave you.

[Cole] I see people.

959
01:37:57,939 --> 01:38:00,400
They don't know
they're dead.

960
01:38:04,571 --> 01:38:09,328
- [Malcolm] How often
do you see them?
- [Cole] All the time.

961
01:38:11,997 --> 01:38:13,915
[Cole] They're everywhere.

962
01:38:25,262 --> 01:38:27,767
They only see
what they want to see.

963
01:38:33,147 --> 01:38:36,652
[Malcolm On TV] Okay, Mikey.

964
01:38:36,736 --> 01:38:40,031
Come on.
Give me a minute.

[Whimpering]

972
01:39:18,078 --> 01:39:20,414
- Oh, God.
- [Groaning]

973
01:39:20,497 --> 01:39:24,126

01:39:58,668 --> 01:40:02,505
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went--

980
01:40:02,589 --> 01:40:04,924
went in and out.

981
01:40:07,929 --> 01:40:11,141
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

982
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:43,012
I think
I can go now.

983
01:40:46,726 --> 01:40:49,187
I just needed
to do a couple things.

I needed
to help someone.

And I needed
to tell you something.

You were never second.

Ever.

You sleep now.

Everything will be
different in the morning.
