1
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:10,538
Speed is very important when you're driving
but it must be control accurately

2
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,588
With courage and driving
skill don't you know

3

00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,954
but keep on proper balance

5
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,449
eyes looking forward
backward and to both sides

6
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,240

At 12 he's late what's on

11
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,491
Maybe that guy is too scared to come

Really like flying

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,309
They've arrived gas station
of clear water bay road

81
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,573
if sky did not fooling

82
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,241
He'd have lead by quite a distance

83
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,538
I'll hand to the next stand

84
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,329
Now they're racing on

85
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,956
it's really interesting

86
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,786
the road becomes their racing track

87
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:29,741

88
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,277
What are you looking little girl

89
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,032
I have bet on so I must know the result

90
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,698
it's only a small amount

91
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,532
They're entering junk bay tunnel

92
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,790
sky and maddie are both trying
to surpass the other

93
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,707
I wonder how many times
they have changed gear

94
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,875
look

95
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,998
They overtake the cars on the road swiftly

96
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,698
pretty fast

97
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,409
It's a Porsche it's really fast nuts

98
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,666
The Porsche is ahead of sky now

99
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,665
Sky really smashes its windscreen

100
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,243
He deserves capsizing

101
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:26,250
Out the tunnel now sky changes to 3rd gear

102
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,790
maddie is following far behind
and can't see sky's car

103
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:29,958
he'll surpass me soon

104
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,950

110
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,125
boss is smart

111
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,832

accelerator from now on

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,160

Don't you know how to

129
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,245
You can't knock his leg
but can repair cars

130
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,953
It's like this to break his leg

131
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:09,323
Boss

132
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,133

138
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,412
Of course sky is the winner

139
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,495

others he's the dare devil

140
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,957

141
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,207
it's a motorbike race

142
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,457
it only takes 3 seconds to reach 100 kPH

143
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,786

144
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,572
when I arrived

145
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,536
I saw sky on that motorbike

146
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,615
he's so cool

147
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,492
Only that motorbike can match sky

148
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,393
do you know how powerful
that motorbike 1s

149
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,031
Don't know

150
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,559
do you know what means by double speed

151
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,914
No idea  and quadrate speed

152
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,289
What is it Tell me

153
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,851

155
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,411

00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,914
And how tall is he Tell us

157
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,039

159
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,407

thanks

162
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,911
I say sky is a bit too much on that

163
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,625
too much of what

164
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:39,661
I mean his side bet with
maddie would be a leg

165
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,494
it's too much to break the opponent's leg

166
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,032
but they mutually agreed

167
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,541
this world talks of money

168
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,662
I have to go you stay
here and fool with him

169
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,415
paddy don't go

it's getting out of control now

485
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,366
the most I can do is to
increase it by 15 bars

486
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,559
but the car will be controlling you

487
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,073

488
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,663

 They left long ago

508
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,249
I should have taken a taxi here

509
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,369
who sat next to him

510
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,703
His girlfriend Kelly you know her

511
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:45,955
You want to take that seat

512
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,413
If I hadn't arrived late
it must have been me

513
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,742
brother

514
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,032
What's happened

515
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,117
It's vital

516
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,408
the race today is the race of the century

517
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,698
tang fung vs sky

518
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,287
the track is from kwun
tong to lung cheung road

519
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,245
then up castle road to texaco road junction

520
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:17,740
then uturn and back to the starting point

521
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,374
whoever reaches there first is the winner

522
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,248
Don't lose

523
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,865

00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,659
A race never wins unless
he reaches the finale

529
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,243

540
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:11,659
all who take part in such
underground races will end up dying

541
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,998
is she out

542
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,450

00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,662
Take off shoes put them over there

548

00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,953

596

It's in vain no need to call again

606
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,375
Sky

607
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:04,534
your mom has made all efforts already

608
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:05,993
and it should be fine now

609
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,158
I'm the one who commit a crime

610
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,289
don't worry I won't get you involved

611
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,573
shut up

612
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:15,954
It's not your affairs only
we're both involved now

613
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,205
if you were not my son

614
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,953
I wouldn't care a dime

615
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,116
look at yourself

616
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,203
I tell you don't ever drive a car

617
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,032
I don't want you to die like your dad

618
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:33,948
My dad

619
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:36,078
How did he die

620
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,448
I remember you quarreled with him

621
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:41,697
and you told me he disappeared
soon you took me to his tomb

622
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,290
you told me he was under there
and wouldn't get up again

623
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,116
is he really dead Is he

624
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:50,309
I take him as if he were dead

625
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,449
You take him as if he were dead
He's alive

626
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:55,454
You cheat me Where is he

627
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,242
Where is he

628
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,198
I don't know

629
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:02,040
Tony arrange for him to leave hk

630
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,948
I won't go unless I make it clear

631
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,538
your mom is right
you'd better leave hk for the moment

632
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,601
you want me to disappear
I'll vanish this minute

633
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,625
I won't ever come back

634
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,077
stand still

635
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:17,785
Stand there

636
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:21,582
Look at him

637
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,116
I do have a secret even
your mom doesn't know it

638
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:32,704
I take your dad as idol

639
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,698
black tone

640
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,831
Is my father

641
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:44,871
Black tone is the real dare devil

642
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,950
the century race between him and tang fung

643
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,786
was breathtaking

644
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:53,498
and there is never such a race anymore

645
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:00,955
every time when black tone won a race

646
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,706
He would give us a ride

647
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
we each gave him $5000

648
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:07,204
riding in his car from Princess road
to clear water bay

649
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,615
was rare experience

650
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,704
you would never forget that experience

651
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:18,993
I don't know whether
it's out of excitement or fear

652
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:22,534
we wet our pants

653
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,869
go and find your dad in Thailand

654
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,744
is he in Thailand

655
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,870
Someone saw him in Thailand years ago

656
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,198
but don't know where exactly he is

657
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,410
Granny

658
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,039
sky

659
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:11,033
Kelly used to say she'd take you to see me

660
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,405
but she is dead now

661
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,704
and we finally meet each other

662
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:23,663
don't be sad

663
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,536
I'm really sad

664
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:31,080
but I don't have anymore tears

665
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:35,619
she arrived from Taiwan 10 years ago

666
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,413
And lived with me since then

667
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:47,411
and you're her only friend

668
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:53,331

What is it

721
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,915
You're competent
you have money to flee to Thailand

722
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,282
All your money has been robbed

723
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,491
shall I give you $1
million to go back to hk

724
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,226

Syringe affected with aids

729
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:45,200
let me give you injection

730
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,539
you want to revenge

731
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:11,787
Get in the car I come
to help you get in

732
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:24,739
Most guys fleeing here from hk come for me

733
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,579
so everyone here calls me king of fleers

734
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,036
I don't mean I must flee

735
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:33,364
and those who flee here
call me king of fleers

736
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:35,202
you say you're so powerful

737
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,476

and get back my money for me

738
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,365
What if I can

739
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:42,704
Report to the police
Remember you are a culprit

740
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,742
and you have lots of rivals in hk

741
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:50,614

745
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:03,990
you know why everyone who
flees to Thailand first

746
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:05,852
The living standard is low in Thailand

747
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,244
a little money lets you live like king

748
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,408
I don't intend to spend my life here

749
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,990

750
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:18,908

Stand there and don't move

860

you're took me for someone else

861
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:56,292
Black tone

862
00:58:56,458 --> 00:59:02,203

863
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:04,532

867
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,948
Saying you're dead

Then uncle asked me to find you here

870
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:57,538
Tony

871
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:00,789
He's a real nice guy

872
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:05,075
your mom is lucky to have him

873
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:08,998
since tang fung's incident

874
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,706

875
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,323
tang fung that tang fung again

876

880
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,032

881
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:32,407

887

Honey this is my son no

890
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:00,750

892
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:04,907

899
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,410
It's just like you

901
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,368

01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:32,905
my honey makes the perfect hot soup

903
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,788

904
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:39,333

905
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,457
honey come on sit down

906
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,658
Son you keep watching TV all day

907
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,565
and you smile whenever I talk to you

908
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,393
and you never remember the
cantonese I teach you

909
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:55,953
you're half Chinese you know

910
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:59,079
Honey you want to smile too

911
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:01,248
You want it day and night don't you

912
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,619
Son you like these dishes

913
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,747
Yes

914
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,408
it's habit in Thailand
same dishes for lunch and dinner

915
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,741
it's not as varied as in hk

916
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,743
see how much I earn today

917
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:16,917
look

918
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,250
what are you doing

919
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,536
Nothing I want to see
how much I earn today

920
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:23,620
not much about 100 baht

921
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,492
my honey I think it's about 200 baht

922
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,535
so little

923
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,040
It's enough for the 3 of us

924
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:36,077
300 baht a day it's hk$3000 a month

925
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,912
it's enough it's not hk here

926
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:42,120
when in hk the money I spent one night

927
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:45,455
Is enough for few year expenses here

928
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,500
the money I spent on modifying cars
is enough for my whole life here

929
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:52,159
you know your mom is rich right

930
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:55,082
Your mom always buys you cars

931
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:57,704
and each costs $1 million right

932
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:35,828
You needn't go to work today

933
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:37,167
How to make a living

934
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:39,707
There aren't many kids
in pattaya that need haircut

935
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,698
so you ask her to work
and make money for you

936
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,990
That's why I married her

937
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,490
I'm a pimp right

938
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,164
Why are you like this

939
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,956
How come

940
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,449
Nothing here is ok

941
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,865
look

942
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,870
I know it was so noisy last night
that I couldn't sleep

943
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,282
of course it was noisy

944
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,083
Are you impotent

945
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:09,167
Of course not

946
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,540
of course I can it's not the same son

947
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,073
this is

948
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:18,697
I teach you because you're my son

949
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,991
I didn't steal it

950
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:25,579
You are telling lies

951
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:28,453
What is it Take it easy

952
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:34,623
she stole my watch while I was sleeping

953
01:04:34,792 --> 01:04:35,792
I didn't

954
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:38,203
Man my wife says she
didn't steal your watch

955
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,184
I'll have her arrested
if she doesn't return my watch to me

956
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,208
yes

957
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,643
do you know who's most furious in pattaya

958
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:43,747
Give me back my watch

959
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,453
You must give me back the watch

960
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,575
Man give me 2 days' time

961
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,248
ok I'll give you 2 days

962
01:04:57,417 --> 01:05:01,114
come to see me at thai boxing gym in 2 days

963
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:05,999
don't move

964
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:08,408
Let's go

965
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,202
Dad

966
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,081
Do you find me useless

967
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,956
I just don't understand

968
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,322
uncle said you were famous
in Princess road racing

969
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,286
I am so proud of it

970
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:36,290
because that black tone is my father

971
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:37,664
that black tone is dead

972
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,575
he's alive he's sitting in front of me

973
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,948
but he became another person

974
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:45,491
yes I'm another person now

975
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:48,032
I'm called black tong now

976
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:50,745
you're still young you can start again

977
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:55,824
but you never fight back
when others bully you

978
01:05:56,792 --> 01:06:01,786
right because I'm disabled now

979
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,623
so I left hk

980
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:06,574
and gave the title of
dare devil to tang fung

981
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:11,830
tang fung and I had 2
races on Princess road

982
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,331
and he wasn't up to me

983
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,869
so they all called me dare devil

984
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,956
I'm the underground champion of car racing

985
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,700
tang fung sent his men to give me money

986
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:28,742
they took me to Macau and fevered

987
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:33,664
And that's why your mother left me

988
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,665
once I lost $5 million in casino Lisboa

989
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:42,659
and this bastard tang fung challenged me

990
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:46,197
saying if I won he would
pay off debts for me

991
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:50,664
and if I lost he would break
my left arm and right leg

992
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,823
so this is it

993
01:06:57,167 --> 01:07:00,364
have you figured out why you lost

994
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:04,166
I didn't figure out why I lost

995
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,990
I used to be snooty

996
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,449
I spent money whatever I liked

997
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,458
I stressed on car modification
and not driving skills

998
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:17,707
my friend paddy advised me not
to make ample modification

999
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,618
but I didn't listen

1000
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,625
he says ample modification makes
the car control me

1001
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:27,239
but I ignore his advice so

1002
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:28,702
Right

1003
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:32,655
do you want to revenge for me

1004
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:40,122
Though I'm disabled I can
become your instructor

1005
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,244
 how is it
 I'm up there too come on

1006
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:46,740
but you

1007
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:51,741
You're in the car you must calculate

1008
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:58,244
Using 3rd gear then down to 2nd gear
to turn this turnoff

1009
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,041
pull and pass

1010
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,999
Son remember that moustache

1011
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:23,285
If you defeat him

1012
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:27,531
they'll forgive my honey's
stealing the rolex

1013
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,410
who is this guy

1014
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,450
This is the dare devil in Thailand

1015
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:36,199
he was 3 time champion in Thailand

1016
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:39,534
he represents Thailand going on
formulae race as well

1017
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,573
he's ranked 48 worldwide

1018
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:43,873
I must lose then you want me to die

1019
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:45,407
Of course not

1020
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:48,784
it was all the past

1021
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,784
he belonged to the 80s like I did

1022
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,697
you know you and I are 2 generation

1023
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:56,660
Of the dare devil

1024
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,448
so you won't lose

1025
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,327
Come on driving such a car

1026
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,037
Yeah so you must use your skills

1027
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,910
Ranked 487

1028
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,949
I really didn't steal the watch

1029
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:42,072
son my honey said she
didn't steal the watch

1030
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:46,037
whether she did or not I must race

1031
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:48,995
but I never thought I would race
for the sake of a rolex

1032
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,449
have you thought of how to defeat the 48th

1033
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:54,957
Yes to drive faster than him

1034
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,664
How to drive faster than him

1035
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:58,789
Then teach me you're my instructor

1036
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:09,832
Without brake and you'll be fast

1037
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:13,411
don't let the speedometer threatens you

1038
01:10:14,292 --> 01:10:17,534
you said it we must overcome our fear

1039
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:19,657
so you must prove it yourself

1040
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:24,073
racing requires a good car
but good skills as well

1041
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:27,491
son you can make it

1042
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,536
take this 10 bucks

1043
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:36,248
my face is on it

1044
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,911
it's a lucky money

1045
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:43,371
remember like this

1046
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,615
honey let's go

1047
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,286
It's dangerous for him

1048
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:12,039
yes but I can't help

1049
01:11:12,208 --> 01:11:14,620
only this can help him overcome his fear

1050
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:16,783
his fear you understand

1051
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:19,954
I know but he's your son
if anything happens

1052
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:22,328
Right he's my son on the track

1053
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,365
even if he dies I still have another son

1054
01:11:24,542 --> 01:11:27,705
if you like we can have
more children right

1055
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:30,412
You smile I need it whenever you smile

1056
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,912
Don't let the speedometer scare you
if you want speed

1057
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:19,950
you must prove yourself
to overcome the fear

1058
01:14:03,542 --> 01:14:04,748
What's it

1059
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,949
Sorry I've found my watch

1060
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:29,581

01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,518

I can't help the garage is
just opened for business

As he fell off flyover
and never reached the finale

1099
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:05,657

1178
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,248
You really don't want to go back to hk

1179
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:33,039
I'm called black tong

1180
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:36,905
and here is my paradise

1181
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,909
hk no longer belongs to me

1182
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:46,865
I've thought it over
if it is not for my buddy paddy

1183
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:49,532
I won't go back to hk

1184
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:54,372
I want to get marry here and live here

1185
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:58,159
I want to count the money
which I make everyday

1186
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,822
control your car accurately is important
while you're driving

1187
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,573
you must learn to use brake

1188
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:07,617
as you failed to use brake
so you drove into the sea

1189
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,160
sometimes it's right

1190
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:14,785
sometimes you must use brake
sometimes the accelerator

1191
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:19,489
some racers don't care about dying

1192
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:24,657
but I'm old

1193
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:28,950
I'm disabled I should retire now

1194
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,199
but you are young you still
have a long way to go

1195
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:37,703
so you must accelerate

1196
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:45,450
son return to hk and create your own world

1197
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:49,948

1214
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:14,206
Kid brother fung wants a
special treat dare you

1215
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,910

1217
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,243
Mechanic

1218
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,660

1220
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,535
Brother

01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,240
brother

1222
01:27:12,167 --> 01:27:14,579
Nancy I've decided to race with tang fung

1223
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,240
as I must get back my ego

1224
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:18,448
I don't want others to look down on me

1225
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:22,956
it's good idea you become apprentice
but you must go to school

1226
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:27,118
it's not bad for you to love sky
but wait till you grow up

1227
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:30,412

1228
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,411
Big head where's my brother

1229
01:27:51,792 --> 01:27:52,827
That bastard tang fung

1230
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,956
insisted on racing last night

1231
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:57,958
and required special treat

1232
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:00,448
but paddy's car capsized

1233
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:03,245
he got trapped in the car

1234
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:06,909

1245
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:58,659

1246
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,187

1252
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:28,957

01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,072

01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:00,033
Hey does brother's note help

1270
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:04,573
Ok

1271
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,243
The spart parts are not enough

1272
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:08,373
we miss some gears and aixles too

1273
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:09,372
what is it

1274
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:10,542
We miss some spare parts

1275
01:32:10,667 --> 01:32:12,309
the computer is not the
type which mechanic said

1276
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:15,245
the 4 spring are impaired
too this won't work

1277
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:16,998
don't bullshit let me steal one back

1278
01:32:18,292 --> 01:32:19,498
what have I said

1279
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,542
What is it

1280
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:31,033
Here is a carton what is inside

1281
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:35,357
That's the gears and aixles we need

1282
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:36,748
all brand new

1283
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:38,077
you ordered them

1284
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,115
Even the computer is new

1285
01:32:41,292 --> 01:32:42,657
does Santa claus send them to us

1286
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:43,993
Don't bullshit

1287
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:46,619
I won't accept things from that bastard

1288
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,664
Come out

1289
01:32:57,917 --> 01:33:01,159
I hope this Christmas present will help

1290
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,447
you stole them

1291
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:04,823
I stole from you

1292
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:07,911
you know you used to spend like king

1293
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,244
You bought numerous spare parts

1294
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:14,246
so me and paddy built a secret drawer

1295
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:18,288
and hide these spare parts
wanting to sell them for cash

1296
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:22,120
now you need them
of course I must give them back to you

1297
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:23,873
I won't let that tang fung have them

1298
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:33,788
Move them in no need to say thank you

1299
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,456
Come in Santa claus

1300
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:43,956
help modify the car

1301
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:51,415
Boss you're tired

1302
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:54,410
Leg massage

1303
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,907
This part talks about nitrogen speeding

1304
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:05,655
as nitrogen is 3 times more
powerful than gasoline

1305
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:08,700
so nitrogen can increase
the explosive power

1306
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:11,332
yet the time must not exceed 10 seconds

1307
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:14,540
remember you control the car

1308
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:21,332
turbo inter cooler
full time 4wheel drive

1309
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,115
this is a super car ever modified

1310
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:24,372
it suits you most

1311
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:26,062
whatever how stupid the opponent is

1312
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:28,749
I must race with all I might have to face

1313
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:35,448
It's on fire

1314
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,866
Take it away it's nitrogen it'll explode

1315
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,871
Use fire extinguisher

1316
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:44,583
Is it alright

1317
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:46,032
It's the last can

1318
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:49,581
sorry

1319
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:53,081
racing wheel suspending shock absorbers

1320
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,010
ap break disk titanium
alloy exhausted pipe

1321
01:34:55,042 --> 01:34:56,703
isn't it a bit too much

1322
01:34:56,958 --> 01:34:59,415
Do you know the dividend on you

1323
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:01,198
It's 10 times

1324
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:03,369
so I'll try my best

1325
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:05,699
after I left the jail I told myself

1326
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:07,623
I mustn't lose again

1327
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:12,120
brother I promise I won't be bad anymore

1328
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:15,284
I must be a fair lady
I must listen to brother sky

1329
01:35:19,542 --> 01:35:20,657
who are you talking to

1330
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:29,081
With my brother

1331
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,828
before the launching of this toy

1332
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,536
I found brother like a panda

1333
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,911
but since it's launched look

1334
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:37,619
it looks like my brother a lot

1335
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:40,327
get up here

1336
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,081
me

1337
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,581
Do you know I never buy toys

1338
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:51,660
As I find they worthless

1339
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:55,409
but there's something
you can buy with money

1340
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,950
don't say so this toy is expensive

1341
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,206
want to sit next to me

1342
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:05,039
You let me sit next to you

1343
01:36:06,417 --> 01:36:07,907
Great

1344
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:13,323
I must revenge for my brother

1345
01:36:14,542 --> 01:36:16,749
how to I'm the driver

1346
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:23,994
Come on let's do some practice

1347
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,498
sit still  ok

1348
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:29,454

1349
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:30,993

1350
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:34,873

1351
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:36,042

1353
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:39,952

1354
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:43,625

Ok

1356
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:23,497
Aren't they here yet

1357
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:26,494
That bastard must be too afraid to come

1358
01:37:26,667 --> 01:37:28,032
no sky is not such a guy

1359
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:30,385
both his father and
himself aren't such guys

1360
01:37:31,917 --> 01:37:34,750
tonight the dividend for
brother fung is 1 to 1

1361
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:36,869
and that bastard is 1 to 5

1362
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:56,875
You drive this lousy car
You'll surely lose

1363
01:37:57,042 --> 01:37:59,374
We fear nothing as you don't fear aids

1364
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:04,541
so you're uneducated

1365
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,198
there's a saying

1366
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:09,165
tools are vital for a success

1367
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:11,244
car racing requires for driving skills

1368
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:12,601
but tools are important as well

1369
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:16,197
I tell you I have enough tools today

1370
01:38:17,167 --> 01:38:18,577

1371
01:38:18,917 --> 01:38:22,159

just as I defeated your father

1372
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:25,780

sends you his regards

1373
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:29,246

like king in Thailand

1374
01:38:30,042 --> 01:38:31,498

1375
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:35,283
and my buddy paddy

1376
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:56,824
Sky the car is in excellent condition

1377
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:59,370
brother will bless you
to defeat that bastard

1378
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:00,910
be gentle

1379
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:04,289

1380
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,198

1381
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:21,575

1382
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:28,615

1383
01:39:31,667 --> 01:39:32,907
take it

1384
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:41,414
It's Kelly's

1385
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:49,864
Remember you are to control the car

1386
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:54,166
some racers don't care about dying

1387
01:44:54,292 --> 01:44:55,907
sometimes you must use brake

1388
01:44:56,167 --> 01:44:58,123
sometimes the accelerator

1389
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:41,073
Sky

1390
01:46:26,625 --> 01:46:31,449
I can't even see his rear lights Why
