1
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:01,719
lt's already recording.

2
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,888
Okay, just...

3
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,556
-This is my home.
-You look a little blurry, man.

4
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:06,641
Let me zoom out on you.

5
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:08,559
-Okay.
-Okay.

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,852
Good morning.

7
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:11,354
-Got it?
-Okay, I got you.

8
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,732
-This is my home.
-Okay.

9
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,777
Which I am leaving the comforts of
for the weekend

10
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,530
to explore the Blair Witch.

11
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:23,074
Some essential reading,
How to Stay Alive in the Woods,

12
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:24,826
'cause you never know
what's going to happen.

13
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:26,411
And this is a very important book

14
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:29,956
because it has the article
about what happened at Coffin Rock.

15
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,416
-That looks pretty old.
-Yeah,

16
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,418
it's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

17
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:37,255
-Hey, it's Mr. Punctuality.
-Hey.

18
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:40,508
-How the hell are you this morning?
-Tired.

19
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,260
So I got the CP up.

20
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:45,430
Good. That's important

21
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:46,889
'cause that's what we're shooting on.

22
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,434
No one knows I took it, but I got it.

23
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:53,604
All right, come on, into the house.
Come on, come on.

24
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:56,065
l can see you.

25
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,735
l'm going to bump into shit.
l'm walking backwards now.

26
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:01,070
Okay, we don't want to fuck up
the cameras before we leave.

27
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,488
So, where's Mikey at?

28
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,781
We have to go get him.

29
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:04,991
Okay.

30
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,993
-We're supposed to get him at 8:30.
-Okay.

31
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,786
Which means we're already
going to be behind schedule,

32
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:11,038
-but it's important to have juice.
-That's cool.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,090
l guess you're Mike.

34
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,761
Here, wait... Stop, stop.

35
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,725
Don't we get to meet your mama?

36
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:29,474
See you later, Mom!

37
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,975
How are you, Mike? lt's nice to meet you.

38
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,644
l'm tired, but l'm doing good.
l'm real excited about this.

39
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:34,812
-Thank you for the opportunity.
-l'm very glad.

40
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:38,316
Well, thank you for getting
the equipment together.

41
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:40,151
We've got so much fucking battery power,

42
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:43,905
we could fuel a small world country
for a month.

43
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:47,492
We got rice, we got Mott's Fruit Punch.

44
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,452
Oatmeal raisin, baby.

45
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:53,539
-Ultimate camp food.
-Marshmallows...

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,668
Feel how soft. Soft...

47
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:58,836
Hey, you weasel.

48
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:01,763
Marshmallows...

49
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,429
Do you believe in ghosts?

50
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,808
Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?

51
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:14,977
lt's... lt actually
sounds kind of familiar.

52
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:17,814
My older sister went to Blair High School.

53
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:21,692
The woods around Halloween time
is a creepy enough phenomenon.

54
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,611
-Just tell me a little bit more...
-l don't want to go cheesy.

55
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,780
l want to really avoid any cheese.

56
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,533
l want to present this
in as straightforward a way as possible,

57
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,202
and I think the legend
is unsettling enough.

58
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:37,006
You guys want to get
the ceremonial first slate?

59
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:40,343
Absolutely.

60
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:45,049
Here he is, filling out our first slate
for our first shot.

61
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,761
Should we all, like, cut our fingers open
and bleed on it?

62
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,221
A little bloodletting on the slate?

63
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:51,722
No, we'll save that for later.

64
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:54,774
Kiss it. Kiss the slate.

65
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:56,686
lt's the first slate.

66
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:58,938
First slate. Marked by my lipstick.

67
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,566
Mikey, first slate. Kiss it. Good luck.

68
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,401
He licked it. God bless him.

69
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:06,404
You're not supposed to eat it.
We need that for the rest of the shoot.

70
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:10,283
This is Burkittsville, formerly Blair.

71
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:13,661
lt is a small, quiet Maryland town,

72
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:16,998
much like a small, quiet town anywhere.

73
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,333
No more than 20 families
laid their roots here

74
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:27,390
over 200 years ago, many of whom remain
either on this hill or in the town below.

75
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:32,096
There are an unusually high number
of children laid to rest here,

76
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,391
most of whom passed in the 1940s.

77
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:39,770
Yet, no one in the town seems to recall
anything unusual about this time.

78
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:41,772
To us, anyway.

79
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:47,278
Yet, legend tells a different story.
One whose evidence is all around us,

80
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,205
etched in stone.

81
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,956
Well, we have shot the first scene.
The cemetery scene.

82
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:01,626
The opening is shot.

83
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,586
-We're doing a documentary.
-Yeah?

84
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:06,464
About the Blair Witch.

85
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,924
-Have you heard of the Blair Witch?
-Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,301
That's an old, old, old story.

87
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:14,805
As I remember, Mr. Parr was an old hermit.

88
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:17,141
-Right.
-And he lived up on a mountain.

89
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,976
He had a place up there.

90
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,561
Been there for a long, long time.

91
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,980
-You've heard of the Blair Witch?
-Several times.

92
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:25,483
Several times?
And what was the first incident?

93
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:29,111
l've heard stories about her from people
and neighbors and stuff like that.

94
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:32,323
But also I saw a documentary
on the Discovery Channel, or somewhere,

95
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:33,491
-once about her.
-Really?

96
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:36,077
About the ghosts and legends of Maryland.

97
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:38,621
Yeah, that's a story
my grandmother used to tell us all.

98
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,373
-Make us go to bed early.
-Really?

99
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,376
They say if you stay up after dark,
walk around the house too much,

100
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,252
the Blair Witch will come and get you.

101
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,046
Sort of in the winter, I guess,

102
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:53,135
the fall or the winter of 1940, some of
the young kids started to disappear.

103
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:56,514
Nobody knew anything
about why they were...

104
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,974
Why they were disappearing.

105
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:59,850
The creepiest...

106
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:02,186
-The creepiest story about her...
-That's kind of an omen, isn't it?

107
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:06,065
...that I ever heard
was that two men were out hunting,

108
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,567
and they were camped near the cabin,
or something,

109
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,694
that she's supposed to haunt.

110
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:10,736
No, no!

111
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,697
And they disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

112
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:13,781
-No.
-Really?

113
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,866
Okay, it's all right, lngrid.
l'm just telling a scary story,

114
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,202
-but it's not true.
-lt's not true.

115
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,956
Finally, one day,
old Mr. Parr come down into the market

116
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,916
and said, "l'm finally finished."

117
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,084
And what did he mean by that?

118
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,169
l guess nobody knew at first,

119
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,382
but the police
finally went up on the mountain

120
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,426
and they searched his house

121
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,303
and they found the bodies
of seven kids from the area.

122
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:38,389
What he did is, he took the kids

123
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,059
down into the basement by twos
and he made one face into the corner.

124
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,227
Really?

125
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,770
And then he would kill the other one.

126
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,356
And then when he was done with that,
he'd grab the one out of the corner

127
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:48,858
and kill that one, too.

128
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,443
And those were the seven kids
that were missing.

129
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,612
And then they brought them
out of the woods one at a time,

130
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,573
and it just was a terrible thing.

131
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:57,241
Just tore the whole community up.

132
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,243
Said in court that
he couldn't take the eyes on him.

133
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,828
He could...
He could feel the eyes watching him.

134
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,497
That's why he made them
face into the corner like that.

135
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:08,085
All my life, really, l've believed
in witches and ghosts and all that stuff.

136
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:10,087
Do you believe that
there are some in this area?

137
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,172
Definitely.

138
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:13,382
-Do you believe in witchcraft?
-No.

139
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:14,508
-No?
-No, sir.

140
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,885
Are you a religious man?

141
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:17,511
-Yep.
-All righty.

142
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:19,305
Pretty creepy stuff.

143
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,849
l believe there's something
happening with her.

144
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,602
And you think that it's possible
that she's still up there now?

145
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:26,228
-l don't go up there.
-You don't go up there?

146
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,022
Yeah, I believe enough not to go up there.

147
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,441
And they say that the woods
are all haunted up there

148
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,609
and stuff like that, but...

149
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,486
What do they say? How are they haunted?

150
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,448
l don't... There really isn't many people
that say that it's haunted,

151
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,117
but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who used to...

152
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:43,954
-Mary Brown?
-Yeah, and she was kind of a crazy lady.

153
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,956
How was she seen by the community?

154
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:47,083
Crazy.

155
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:51,754
That's it. The American flag.
That's Mary's house.

156
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:52,838
l'm going to grab her and bring her out.

157
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,923
Why don't you take a look around

158
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,132
and see where the best light is, all right?

159
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,517
Okay.

160
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,522
This is Mary's gate.

161
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,976
l'm not even sure how I pull this open.

162
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:09,021
'Cause something interesting happened to
you, actually, at one point in your life.

163
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,483
You had an encounter with the Blair Witch?

164
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:17,905
Yes. That is a really,
kind of, scary story.

165
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,573
To, kind of, make ends meet,

166
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:23,661
my dad and I would go fishing
down by Tappy's Creek.

167
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:27,498
-Right.
-And, you know, it's in Burkittsville.

168
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:31,001
l was lying down on the leaves,
a pile of leaves,

169
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:34,004
kind of watching my pole
and looking up at the sky.

170
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:36,048
-Sure.
-And all of a sudden,

171
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,176
-l felt like something was near me.
-Right.

172
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,679
You know, kind of an eerie feeling.

173
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,140
lt was like a woman,

174
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:49,812
only on her arms and on her hands
and everything it was like hair.

175
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:53,899
Like a real dark, almost black, hair.

176
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,776
-Like a horse.
-Like fur?

177
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:58,195
Yeah, like a fur. Like horse fur.

178
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,115
-Then on her arms, she had a shawl...
-Right.

179
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,408
Wool shawl over her.

180
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,534
And she scared you?

181
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:07,329
-She threatened you?
-And she didn't say anything,

182
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,167
but she just kept staring,
and then she opened up her shawl...

183
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,209
And what was under there?

184
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,421
And under there was hair
on her body like a horse.

185
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,590
So she was hairy from head to toe?

186
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,634
Yeah, and her legs...

187
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:23,804
-And you could see she was a female.
-Right. How about her face?

188
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:27,016
lt was just kind of, like, strange-looking.

189
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:30,144
Thank God, she's not in the film business.
l mean, can you imagine working with her?

190
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:33,230
She thinks she is in the film business.
She also says she's a ballerina.

191
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:34,732
-Get out.
-She says she's a historian

192
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,317
writing a book on American history...

193
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,110
-l heard that.
-...and that she's a scientist

194
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,862
who does research
at the Department of Energy.

195
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,155
l fucked up on Mary.

196
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,407
l'm checking my depth of field chart
to see how bad.

197
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,619
So you measured for meters? What?
We're not in Europe.

198
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,871
Yeah, the fucking lens
has meters on it, okay.

199
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:52,416
lt also has our system.

200
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,927
No, it had meters on it. Look.

201
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:59,089
This is an American camera, though.

202
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,925
All those are meters.

203
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,343
What about the brown ones?

204
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,552
The brown ones are feet.

205
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,930
Yeah, the brown ones are on there, right?

206
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:08,432
Yeah, but the white ones are obvious.

207
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,184
But I thought
you've used this camera before, man.

208
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,853
l've used it, like, once before.

209
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:15,981
How do we feel about today, guys?

210
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,441
-l learned a lot, man.
-Yeah.

211
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,902
You learned a lot about Mary Brown?

212
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:23,072
No, I learned a lot about, like, fucking...

213
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,698
Sixteen?

214
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:28,327
Just shooting out here. Just shooting doc.

215
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,663
-We kicked some ass today.
-Cheers to you.

216
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,456
-Very good day.
-Excellent day.

217
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,124
Very good first day.

218
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,460
Okay, we're going to do
an equipment check,

219
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,586
but l'm going to call my mom.

220
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,088
Okay, l've got a bag of Utz and a beer.

221
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,340
And we don't really need
to get that on film.

222
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,509
So, I guess you're covered, then.

223
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,094
Could you just run it
for a couple of feet for me

224
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,596
so we can check that it's okay?

225
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:48,973
Sure.

226
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:51,141
l just want to hear
if this mag is loaded properly,

227
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:53,811
so we can shoot some stuff.

228
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:56,855
Okay, that's good. That's good.

229
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,483
-That's good, thank you.
-Okay.

230
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,236
Let's be relaxed 'cause we've got
a really, really long day tomorrow.

231
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:05,114
Today was cake compared to tomorrow.
We're going to do a lot of hiking.

232
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,365
We're going to have a lot
of weight on our backs.

233
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,616
l'm preparing.

234
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:08,659
That's what we're preparing for.

235
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,997
Shut up, you smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

236
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:14,832
-l'm freaking out.
-You can't do that.

237
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,667
-You're the director.
-Yes, l... You know, at this point,

238
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:18,252
l fucking have to do that, all right?

239
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:21,596
l fucking have to. Do we have any weed?

240
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:23,507
Here I go.

241
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:26,475
Drink, drink.

242
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,314
l fucking hate Scotch.

243
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,772
-There's my friend Josh.
-Hey.

244
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,858
-How are you?
-l'm hurting.

245
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,193
l'm not ready for that thing
that you're doing, like, you know...

246
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:46,037
l know you don't like it. Okay.

247
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:47,990
Hello.

248
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,575
Welcome to Day Two.

249
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,785
The trail is somewhere along here.
We shouldn't miss it.

250
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:55,671
lt should be pretty, pretty obvious.

251
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,125
You guys say you know something
about the Blair Witch?

252
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:00,878
l've heard the myths.
l don't really believe much in it.

253
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,920
"The myth"?

254
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,714
-That's all I think it is.
-Damn fool kids'll never learn.

255
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,425
-What'd you say, sir? -l said, "You
damn fool kids'll never learn."

256
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,634
Shut up.

257
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,887
-"Damn fool kids'll never learn"?
-That's what I said.

258
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,722
And what makes you say that?

259
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,182
First of all, can I have your permission

260
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,850
to put your image on video
for the purposes

261
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,728
of a documentary entitled
The Blair Witch Project?

262
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:21,732
-l don't care much about that, but...
-Well, you have to say yes or no, sir.

263
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,900
-Watch it.
-Sorry.

264
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,568
Yeah, sure, that's all right.

265
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:28,489
Yeah, some girl back in the late 1800s,

266
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,991
-Robin Weaver I believe her name was...
-Right.

267
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:34,328
...supposedly just wandered off,
disappeared into the woods.

268
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:38,832
Wasn't no "supposedly" about it.
They wandered off.

269
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,459
-Okay, so she wandered off.
-And she got lost.

270
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,585
She got lost.

271
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,921
-Three days later...
-There wasn't no "supposedly."

272
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:49,593
Three days later, she just appears
back on her grandmother's porch.

273
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,761
Right.

274
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:54,014
-And everybody's mystified about it.
-Right.

275
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,266
-She was babbling something...
-She had a tale to tell, too, though.

276
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,977
Yeah, she was babbling something
about the...

277
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,822
An old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

278
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,817
-Did... Did you...
-l'll tell you, I saw,

279
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:05,943
right up there by that tree,

280
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:08,320
-up the creek... I told you that.
-Right, I know.

281
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,324
About a hundred yards,
l saw a white misty thing

282
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,118
that I can't tell what it is, one day.

283
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,830
lt was, like, a gray...
Like, gray vapor rising out of the trees?

284
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,039
Right out of the water.

285
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,166
-Right out of the water, near the trees.
-Up the side of the tree,

286
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,543
and it disappeared over them...

287
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,044
Now you're full of it.

288
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:26,755
No, l'm not full of it,
and I wasn't drinking that day, either.

289
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:30,300
How is that related
to the story of Coffin Rock?

290
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:34,972
-lt all ties in to the story
of Coffin Rock. -How's that?

291
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:37,933
l mean,
anybody worth their salt around here

292
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,936
knows that this area's been haunted
by that old woman for years.

293
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:43,988
That's bullshit.

294
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:48,610
This is some serious woods
we're heading into.

295
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,696
Excited?

296
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,281
You got it.

297
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:57,126
l hope he's not rolling off
a whole shitload of stock.

298
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:18,182
Yeah.

299
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:19,766
l could help you,
but l'd rather stand and record.

300
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:20,851
Okay.

301
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:21,935
Packs are on?

302
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,979
-We're rocking. Let's rock.
-We're ready to go.

303
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,816
-We got to go up to the shack, the shanty?
-Yeah.

304
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,326
Wow.

305
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,572
Yeah, it's like we're off
to the Andes or something.

306
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:37,666
Oh, my God, this is a very heavy backpack.

307
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:41,997
On our way to Coffin Rock.
We are totally on track.

308
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,625
l know exactly where we are now.

309
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:45,876
-Mikey, throw me the video camera.
-No, don't.

310
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:50,012
l wanna get her going across, man.

311
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,309
l see a dirty behind.

312
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,973
-Yeah. Good jump.
-Thank you, thank you.

313
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:05,020
There it is. See? That's Coffin Rock.

314
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,321
Go.

315
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:12,569
"They went into the woods
prepared to find death.

316
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,530
"What they found was
a desecration of humanity

317
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:18,200
"at the site which trappers
have often referred to as Coffin Rock.

318
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,409
"On top of the rock formation

319
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,206
"the story of the torture inflicted
upon these brave five men unfolded.

320
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,415
"Each was bound to the other,

321
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,085
"each man's hands bound
to the next man's feet,

322
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:30,337
"forming a solid structure out of the men.

323
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,756
"Blood at the edges of the head indicate
that this act had committed...

324
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:36,635
"Been committed while each was alive
and able-bodied enough to struggle.

325
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,347
"In the torso of each man
the intestines had been torn out crudely.

326
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:44,476
"On each man's sun-bleached face
was inscribed indecipherable writing,

327
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,187
"cut into their flesh
with an eerie precision.

328
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,481
"The men, stilI entranced
by the horror of what had happened,

329
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,275
"Ieft the scene to find the sheriff,

330
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,484
"and did not sketch the writing

331
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,945
"and did not remove the bodies
from the rock.

332
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:57,406
"Upon return,
vultures were seen at the rock,

333
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:58,740
"but upon inspection,

334
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,618
"the bodies had been removed
by persons unknown.

335
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,746
"The search party claimed
that the stench of death was still thick"

336
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:09,710
"and whomever had taken the bodies
had done so in a matter of hours."

337
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:14,096
That happened here at Coffin Rock.

338
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,217
lt felt really rushed
'cause I really want to get to camp,

339
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:19,928
and it's 4:52 and we're going to be late.

340
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,771
We're going to be losing light soon.

341
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:26,852
But, I mean, I can always use the shot
without me in it

342
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,480
because I recorded sound in the rock
reading the whole thing.

343
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:34,283
So, I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

344
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,906
lt's starting to rain.

345
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,409
-What did you do, rent this thing?
-Yeah.

346
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,910
l don't have a tent for three people.

347
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,996
-You know, l'm not used to...
-No, l'm just wondering.

348
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:49,374
l'm not usually traveling with two men,
if you know what l'm saying.

349
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,337
lt is pouring rain right now.
We can't even get a fire going.

350
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:57,341
Show the kids at home
what the stick is for.

351
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:58,800
Look at that.

352
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,552
We've got our very own leaning post.

353
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,014
lf you get too much ass
smell in the night...

354
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,683
Okay, who wouldn't let me have
a cigarette in the tent,

355
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:09,436
but he's allowed to fart
as much as he wants?

356
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:13,447
-l really don't think it's...
-No, I never gave Mike any fart allowance.

357
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:15,192
So, you heard noises last night?

358
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,485
-l totally heard noise.
-See, the problem is,

359
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:17,819
l sleep like a fucking rock.

360
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,946
lt was like there were two separate noises

361
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,658
coming from two layers of space over here

362
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:24,493
and one of them was kind of, like...

363
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,745
One of them could have
possibly been an owl,

364
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,373
but the other one was, like, a cackling...

365
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:30,707
-Was a definite...
-No way.

366
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,751
lt was a total cackling, man.

367
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:36,171
lf I heard a cackling,
l would've shit in my pants.

368
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,800
-Where'd we start out yesterday?
-Off the map.

369
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,885
-Off the map.
-'Cause I knew where we were going.

370
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,970
Though I know there was some confusion,

371
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:46,181
-but today...
-Wait, wait, wait. Say that again.

372
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,141
l said, "l knew where we were going."

373
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,393
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

374
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:52,145
-Would that be a full-of-shit statement?
-No, I did...

375
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:54,189
-Would that be a full-of-shit statement?
-l did know where...

376
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,900
All l'm saying is that
you got us lost, man.

377
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,277
-For a very brief amount of time.
-Okay.

378
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,737
-Just don't get us lost today.
-lt was very brief.

379
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:01,780
Yeah, serious.

380
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,031
l'm not.
l know where all of these places are.

381
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,574
They're all very well-documented.

382
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,702
So, what's up? Are you happy
with the way the documentary's going?

383
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,412
-Yes, I am. Yeah.
-Yeah?

384
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:11,665
And l'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

385
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,175
-"Our little Mikey"?
-Our little Mikey.

386
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:18,964
-So, what's up?
-He's a very spirited young man.

387
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,758
l mean, what's your take
on the Blair Witch at this point?

388
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,395
-Do you think she exists?
-l don't know. I don't know.

389
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,224
Heather, I really wish
you'd found a trail...

390
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:31,393
There's a trail on top of this hill,
don't worry.

391
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:34,813
-lt is a trail.
-This is not a trail.

392
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,615
We like shortcuts, don't we?

393
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,112
We like level shortcuts.

394
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,322
-We don't like mountainous shortcuts.
-lt's a little warmer today,

395
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,658
so this is the first time
we're seeing Mike's chest.

396
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,618
lt's really hard to pick
up on video, actually.

397
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,080
Mike has really sporadic hair patterns
on his chest.

398
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:57,711
-lt's like a symbol, man.
-lt's, like, blank, hairy, blank, hairy.

399
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:58,795
You should see my ass.

400
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:02,299
Look, look. lt's fucking Uruguay,
right there, right there.

401
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,967
-Wow.
-There's Paraguay over here.

402
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,386
-Yeah, whatever.
-Look, I think I see Bolivia.

403
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,264
What killed this dead mouse?

404
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:11,940
Witchcraft?

405
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,145
How about God?

406
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,189
ls that the Blair Witch?

407
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,409
No. I think it's Heather taking a piss.

408
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,114
You know, this is really not too good.
l really have to go.

409
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:29,659
-Don't torture me.
-Go.

410
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,162
We are hot on the cemetery trail.

411
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:33,455
-lt should only be a...
-Says you.

412
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:34,873
-What?
-Says you.

413
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:39,419
Says me, of course. And...

414
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,639
We should be hitting it
in about 90 minutes.

415
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,259
-You guys cool with that?
-What?

416
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,178
-90 minutes.
-As long as you know where we're going.

417
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,388
-Can you hang?
-l know exactly where we're going.

418
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,682
Josh feels it's necessary to look
at the map now, even though I know

419
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,601
where we're going
and we're going straight ahead up there.

420
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:57,145
lf you've known where we're going,
we wouldn't be hiking like...

421
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:58,230
We're in the middle of
the fucking woods, man.

422
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,941
-How could you possibly know?
-Some of it is off-trail hiking.

423
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,150
Because people told you?

424
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:04,027
"Oh, yeah,
there's a cemetery back in there."

425
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,363
lf we're lost, admit that first, because...

426
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,156
We're not... I know we're not lost.

427
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:09,991
You knew that yesterday, too,
and you knew that twice today.

428
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,701
Look... No, bullshit, and l...

429
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:14,496
-We have not been lost at all today.
-That's...

430
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:16,039
-That is not true.
-Not once. I know where we're going.

431
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,500
-Okay, this is where we were.
-Let me tell you what you said to us.

432
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,752
"lt's, like, two miles away."
Then, it's like, "Two hours away..."

433
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,546
-Okay, just, just chill. Just chill.
-"Three hours away."

434
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,756
Maybe it's four hours away.
How could you...

435
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,385
-Did you agree to do this project?
-l did. I agreed to a scouted-out project.

436
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:29,886
l didn't agree to
just trounce around the woods.

437
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:31,638
lt is scouted out,
and I told you getting to the location

438
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,181
-wasn't going to be easy.
-Mike, Mike... Okay! Guys!

439
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,725
-l've got $1,500 worth of equipment on me.
-Guys, it's cool, it's cool.

440
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:37,602
Please, you're being a smartass,
you're being a smartass...

441
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,187
Let's just... We're looking at the map.

442
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,438
-We're going to find this the best we can.
-Okay.

443
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,357
l can totally find this.

444
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,150
This is where we were.

445
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:46,653
We're going more or less this way.

446
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:50,156
Mika, what's your call?
l mean, where do you think we're going?

447
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:52,951
l'll tell you the truth.

448
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:57,205
This is, like... This is Greek to me.

449
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,415
-Right.
-lt's useless.

450
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,791
Exactly.

451
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,044
So, l'm just putting my trust in you

452
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,463
that you know where it is.

453
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,465
Good.

454
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:11,261
Although I got to tell you,
l don't fully trust you.

455
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:12,888
And l... No, l'm not going to say it.

456
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:13,930
What?

457
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,683
Nothing. I don't know why you have
to have every conversation on video, man.

458
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,310
-Tape some ambiance.
-'Cause we're making a documentary.

459
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,561
Not about us getting lost.

460
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:22,939
We're making a documentary about a witch.

461
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,609
l have a camera. Doesn't hurt because

462
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,362
we'll all look back on this
and laugh heartily, believe me.

463
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:31,615
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

464
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:33,450
Just breathe and don't look down, maybe?

465
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,119
-No, you've got to look down.
-You're gonna have to crawl.

466
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,412
-l'm hitting the crawl.
-Cool.

467
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,497
Think about how cool the fucking cemetery

468
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,091
is gonna be when we get there.

469
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,421
Think of the joy
of being in a really good film.

470
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:49,466
-Okay, shut the fuck up.
-Okay, l'm quiet.

471
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,592
Shit. How am I gonna do this?

472
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:53,637
-Okay, Mikey?
-Yeah?

473
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:55,847
Dude, there's no way you're coming across

474
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,349
with your DAT on your belly, man.

475
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,644
-No way, man.
-There's no chance.

476
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:01,978
How are we going to get
the DAT across then?

477
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,313
lt's really fucking hard, man.

478
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:05,148
-How are we gonna get the DAT across?
-The one this morning

479
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:06,483
with the moss was cool.

480
00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:12,037
-This is slippery as shit.
-How are we gonna get the DAT across?

481
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,283
l don't know. Let me get out of here
and put my pack down.

482
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:17,327
l'll just go back and forth.

483
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,995
You want to go back and forth?
You could do it that way.

484
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:20,163
l didn't want to do this at all, but...

485
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,373
Okay, let's do...

486
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:24,091
Yeah, we'll do it back and forth.

487
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,586
What'd you drop?

488
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:29,005
l didn't drop anything.

489
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,590
-The tree just broke on me.
-The log broke.

490
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:31,883
Oh, fuck.

491
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:35,936
We're very, very, very close now.

492
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,648
You guys excited?

493
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,019
Okay.

494
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,737
What's this?

495
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,571
What is this?

496
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,331
Dude. Guys?

497
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,870
Do you remember something
that Mary Brown said the other day?

498
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:03,540
What was the story from the Bible
that she was telling us?

499
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,376
Fuck, I wasn't listening to her
'cause I thought she was a lunatic.

500
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:09,713
lt was Esau, but it
was something about a pile of rocks.

501
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:12,632
She was totally telling us
about her rocks, man.

502
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:16,553
What the fuck was it about a pile of rocks?

503
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:19,681
Does anybody remember?

504
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:23,476
-"To live your life..."
-This is like...

505
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:26,730
-"Live your life..."
-Looks like an lndian burial ground, man.

506
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:32,659
See, I don't know if this counts.
Three... Four...

507
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:38,165
Five... Six...

508
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:39,868
Seven.

509
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:44,539
Witches in days gone by
were roasted just like my Vienna sausage.

510
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,916
Flames are licking you
like the devil there, Josh.

511
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:51,129
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
A tale of a fateful trip

512
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,508
That started on this desert isle
Aboard this tiny ship

513
00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:00,889
Yeah, but this ship has a good captain, not
a fat, beer-guzzling guy in a blue shirt.

514
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,099
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

515
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,768
They had no beer on the island, man.

516
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,605
lf they'd had beer,
they would have had, like, big-ass orgies.

517
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:13,359
You're kind of like the Captain
and Mike's kind of like your Gilligan.

518
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,694
-No offense.
-That's all right.

519
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:19,532
l mean that as a compliment.
Gilligan was a funny guy.

520
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,826
The Captain was fat, though.

521
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,995
Well. Okay, let's call it a thin captain...

522
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:27,457
Let's not call it "the Captain" anymore,
you illiterate TV people.

523
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,251
lt's the Skipper.

524
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:33,379
-No more "captain."
-Oh, my.

525
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,883
Here we are back at the rock again.
The rock thing.

526
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:39,886
The cemetery deal.

527
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:44,606
l just want to be careful
not to get in the film shot.

528
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:53,740
lt certainly is odd.

529
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,240
You didn't just knock that over.

530
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:01,699
Please, tell me
you didn't just knock that over.

531
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,493
l just knocked it over.

532
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:06,246
That's not very nice.

533
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:09,798
Let me put it back.

534
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,049
Can't be too careful.

535
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,635
What did you think?

536
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:24,347
lt was, you know,
the same thing, only darker.

537
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:28,518
Yeah, pretty much. All right.

538
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,687
Bag it up, put it away.

539
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:33,155
Hello?

540
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:36,199
Shit. The light.

541
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:45,368
-We were sleeping.
-Do you want this?

542
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:49,379
Just keep it by the opening in the tent.

543
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,935
Listen.

544
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,480
Hello?

545
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:17,567
lt's all around us.

546
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:19,694
That is fucking weird.

547
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:22,071
Michael, are you saying
you're not coming down?

548
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:23,740
-l ain't going down there.
-Why not?

549
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:24,949
Because l'm not. I don't hear shit...

550
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,075
Because you're fucking scared.

551
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:28,494
-Because I don't hear anything anymore.
-Because you're fucking scared.

552
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:30,872
We heard... You could not deny hearing it.

553
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:34,466
Get your ass out. What's the big deal?

554
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:38,171
-This rain fucking blows, man.
-l know.

555
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:40,423
lt's raining very heavily.

556
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:43,676
Thank my mom for giving me rain gear
for my 18th birthday.

557
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:45,970
God bless her.

558
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,682
What do you think that was last night?

559
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:51,434
-Personally?
-Yeah.

560
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:54,103
l think it was
someone fucking with your head.

561
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:55,939
But nobody knows we're out here.

562
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,067
Yeah, but you ever see Deliverance?

563
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,568
Did you understand at all
where I was coming from?

564
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,111
That I just wanted...
Whatever it was, I didn't know...

565
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:05,615
-You were freaking out. You bugged me out.
-l was freaking out.

566
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:07,867
l woke up all of a sudden
and shit's going down.

567
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:10,411
All I can think is,
"l got to get it. I got to get it."

568
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:12,705
All I want it on...
l want it on sound, I want it on 16.

569
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:15,959
lf anything, if we can see anything,
l want to see it on 16.

570
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,003
Well, it sounded to me
like a bunch of people running around,

571
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,090
and l'm not down with messing
with the locals or whatever.

572
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,508
l don't know who the hell
would come out here.

573
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,969
What bugs me out is that
we're so damn deep in the woods

574
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,762
and people are going to try and...

575
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:29,013
And come out here and mess with us,

576
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,348
then they got to have
something wrong with them.

577
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,725
-And l'm not going to play with that.
-How do we know it was people?

578
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:36,653
Well, even if it wasn't,
l'm not going to play with that, either.

579
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:39,732
Fuck, man.

580
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:41,734
This has been a very long day.

581
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:46,037
A very wet, very long day.

582
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:51,494
Nobody's really speaking to me
at the moment.

583
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:55,164
Dude, I don't remember a portion of this
from walking in.

584
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:56,291
What?

585
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:59,085
l don't remember a portion of this
from walking in from the car.

586
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:02,588
Well, we have to go a little differently

587
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:06,808
to get back, because we went around
in a curve a little bit.

588
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,931
l'm telling you guys, two more hours max.

589
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:13,766
lf the way we came in was the fastest,

590
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:18,104
why the fuck are we going back
a different way?

591
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:20,481
Because we have to go around. We came...

592
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,734
That was the most direct way
to hit our two locations.

593
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:25,069
Now, this is the most direct way
back to the car.

594
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,655
-Seriously, really?
-Yes. Seriously.

595
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:30,158
-You know exactly what's going on?
-Yes.

596
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,119
Let's just keep going.

597
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,039
Yeah, we'll wait five minutes
and do a map check.

598
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,623
All right.

599
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:39,125
Okay, we just did a map check

600
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:42,337
and it seems like
we're still pretty much on trail.

601
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:44,714
That's not what I said.

602
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:49,809
No, I think we're all right.
Come on, let's just keep going.

603
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:52,889
We took a map reading.
We just follow what the compass says.

604
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,975
We're going straight ahead.
We're going that way. That way.

605
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:58,436
We are in the middle of nowhere.

606
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,855
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

607
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:02,899
The car is parked
in the middle of nowhere almost.

608
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,035
Like, look at this shit, man.
This is nothing.

609
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:11,206
Okay, let's just keep going, all right?

610
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,952
-l think we should camp.
-Get the fuck out of here.

611
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,080
Why? Because you don't know
where we're going?

612
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:18,915
No, because I think
we're still a ways off from the car

613
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:22,210
and it's going to be
getting dark real soon.

614
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:24,420
-Look, l'm not saying for certain...
-We're not camping here.

615
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:26,297
-Get us home. Turn the camera off.
-Maybe we're near the car.

616
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,840
-Get us home.
-Give me the fucking map.

617
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,384
Give me the map. Heather, give me the map.

618
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:32,261
-Turn the camera off and give me the map.
-Turn the camera off and get us home.

619
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:35,640
l'm not turning the camera off.
l want to mark this occasion.

620
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,558
-Give me the map.
-The map is in my pocket.

621
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,851
You're going to have to wait a second.

622
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:42,772
-You want to see the map?
-Goddamn!

623
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:44,941
lf we keep our heads together,
we'll be just fine.

624
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:48,361
-Fucking bullshit!
-Mike, chill.

625
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:49,946
Just relax, Mike.

626
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:52,573
Don't fucking tell me to relax!

627
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:55,159
Let's walk up, find a tree to sit under
or some shit, check the map...

628
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,163
Yes, can we find a place to sit
to check the map, please?

629
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,917
-Are you happy?
-l'm not happy, no.

630
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:04,043
But the car is not far.

631
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:05,962
We're just not going to be able to
find it in the dark.

632
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:08,714
Are you absolutely, positively sure?

633
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:10,758
Yes. l'm so sorry, man.

634
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,802
We can probably still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

635
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:14,262
We have to. We have to.

636
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,471
We will. We will.

637
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,473
We will get the DAT back
before it's due back tomorrow.

638
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:19,475
l've got to get the fucking camera back.
l got to fucking work.

639
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:21,394
-Everything will get back tomorrow.
-l got to work.

640
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:23,604
l'm supposed to be at work
tomorrow at 9:00, man.

641
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:24,939
-l know.
-lt's fine.

642
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,610
-Let's just go to sleep. Let's go to sleep.
-Let's camp. Let's just fucking camp, okay?

643
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:34,456
l want to get it.
l want to get it from inside the tent.

644
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:42,964
Whatever it was last night,
it sounds like the same fucking thing.

645
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,806
Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold.

646
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,354
Hello?

647
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:04,854
Oh, shit. lt's fucking freezing.

648
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:07,106
There.

649
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,274
What?

650
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:09,859
l hear it.

651
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,487
l don't hear shit.

652
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:15,288
You hear that?

653
00:31:20,037 --> 00:31:22,462
Shit.

654
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,973
Hello?

655
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:55,703
Oh, fuck.

656
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:05,414
l think it's just a deer.

657
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:08,084
lt could be deer, I guess.

658
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:11,462
l don't fucking think it's deer, though, man.
lt sounds exactly like the shit last night.

659
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,130
lt's on all sides of us.

660
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,551
-lt's got to be just, like, a deer.
-lt was a deer, man.

661
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:20,103
-l think it was a fucking...
-lt wasn't like last night.

662
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:27,853
-Did you hear anything?
-Yes! Fucking listen.

663
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:29,772
Okay, let's get it on DAT.
Let's get it on DAT. Be quiet.

664
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:33,741
-Okay, it's on.
-Okay.

665
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:40,665
Jesus Christ! What the fuck is that? Fuck!

666
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:48,590
lt's obviously not scared by our yelling.

667
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:57,432
-But it sounds like footsteps.
-l know. That's a fucking person.

668
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:59,135
Mikey, l'm not seeing shit on video.

669
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,595
l'm going to leave the rest for DAT,
all right?

670
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:01,721
l'm going to stay out
here with you, though.

671
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:03,139
You got to fucking stay out here with me.

672
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,391
-l am, I am.
-What time is it?

673
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:09,694
ls it fucking anywhere
near morning right now?

674
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:14,817
-Let's see...
-Please say it's fucking 5:00 or some shit.

675
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:18,571
-3:00.
-Fuck! This is bullshit.

676
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:22,290
This is absolutely fucking crazy.

677
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:25,578
l'm sorry, Mike.
We should be out of here already.

678
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:30,041
This has got nothing, nothing to do
with what the fuck we're here for.

679
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:33,377
l swear to God, this is bullshit.

680
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,256
Woke up this morning just,
like, two seconds ago,

681
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:41,726
and there are piles of rocks
outside of our tent.

682
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:47,106
There are three, actually.

683
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:49,727
Are you seriously fucking positive
those weren't there

684
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,146
-when we went to bed last night?
-l am seriously fucking positive

685
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:53,230
these were not here.

686
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,900
How would we have, like,
just made a campsite

687
00:33:55,901 --> 00:34:00,154
in between three piles of rocks,
just by coincidence?

688
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:02,198
You don't think this is strange?

689
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,866
This is way fucking weird,

690
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,743
but it really doesn't matter at this point

691
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,537
because all I want to do
is get to the goddamn car.

692
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:11,874
Whatever it is, man... Whatever it is
at this point... Whatever it is...

693
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,834
l know, I know.
We have to get back to the car.

694
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,003
-We're obviously not wanted here...
-Okay, okay...

695
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,546
-...so let's get the hell out.
-We're going home.

696
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:19,757
We have to go...
We have to get the DAT back anyway.

697
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,051
-l realize that. That's what l'm saying.
-Okay, let's go.

698
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,220
Let's get the DAT back.
Let's get our shit packed up.

699
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:26,097
-We're out of here. We're out of here.
-Let's walk.

700
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,515
-Can we just walk?
-Yes. We're out of here.

701
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:29,558
Okay. Cool.

702
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,854
l can't believe we have to leave
just when shit's happening.

703
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:36,315
Heather, put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

704
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:39,735
-Okay. Hang on.
-Let's get the fuck out of the woods, okay?

705
00:34:39,736 --> 00:34:41,821
-Come on.
-No, l'm not fucking scared.

706
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:45,241
l'm just tired, l'm hungry,
l'm fucking, like...

707
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:47,118
l'm just fucking done, man.

708
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,545
-All right.
-l'm just fucking done.

709
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,040
Did you take it?

710
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:57,218
No, I didn't take the fucking map, man.

711
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:01,006
l'm not playing head games.

712
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:03,092
lf anyone's playing head games,
you're playing head games.

713
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:06,429
But l'm not playing head games.

714
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,014
l don't have it. We have to go.

715
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,391
l'm serious. I don't have it.

716
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:12,101
-Are you fucking serious?
-l'm fucking serious.

717
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:15,403
l don't have the map, okay?

718
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,773
-Heather, that is so not cool, man.
-l know it's not cool.

719
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:19,942
-That is so not cool.
-l know it's not cool.

720
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:20,985
That is... That...

721
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,571
l mean, that's the fucking, like,
least responsible thing

722
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:25,781
you could have possibly done, man.

723
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:28,458
l know that.

724
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:32,336
You really don't have it?

725
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:35,166
-One of you have got to have the map.
-No, I don't have the map.

726
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,543
We gave it back to you
after map check yesterday.

727
00:35:37,544 --> 00:35:39,837
You've always had the map.

728
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,547
l know, and l've always had
the map in the same place,

729
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:44,425
and if it's not there,
one of you had to have taken it.

730
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:47,970
l'm not going into your fucking pants
to get your goddamn map, man.

731
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,638
l just checked my pocket,
it's not in my pants.

732
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,307
Look, would I go in and get your map?

733
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:53,809
All I want to do is get out of here, man.
l'm not fucking around.

734
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,936
-That's all I want, too, man.
-Let's go.

735
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:57,980
No, you want to stay here,
you want to film rocks,

736
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,899
you want to look around,
you want to fucking, like,

737
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,484
-get this, you want to get that.
-Let's go.

738
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:03,152
-Which way are we walking?
-That way.

739
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:06,405
Dude, we're in the middle
of the fucking woods!

740
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,657
We're in the middle of the goddamn woods.
We can walk anyway...

741
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,494
We're going this way 'cause that's the way
we've been going for a fucking day.

742
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:13,746
We're going this way, and that's it.
We gotta come across something.

743
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:15,080
l gave you the map, Josh.

744
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:17,625
-l gave you back the map, Heather.
-l gave you the map.

745
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:21,003
l gave you back the map.

746
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,379
-Let's just go.
-All l'm saying is, we can move

747
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,382
as fast as we want, but if we have
no fucking clue where we're moving to,

748
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,592
then it really doesn't matter, does it?

749
00:36:26,593 --> 00:36:29,136
We're following the creek
and Mike seems satisfied with that.

750
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:32,313
Would you guys stop it?

751
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:43,783
We are gone. We are fucked, we are done,
we are dead, we're fucked.

752
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:49,365
l'm just going to stay here.

753
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:54,703
When you guys find somebody, tell them
l'm under this tree with the vine.

754
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:57,672
All blame aside...

755
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:01,460
-This is really fucked up.
-l know.

756
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,587
-Yeah.
-l know.

757
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,507
We really, really, really need
to work together.

758
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:08,843
-Exactly. Exactly.
-l realize this.

759
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:11,846
Okay, so we deal with the fact
that my camera's not going to be back,

760
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:13,931
your DAT's not going to be back.

761
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,725
No blame from now on about that shit.

762
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:21,146
Look, serious,
the area's not that fucking big.

763
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:22,773
Exactly.

764
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,067
lt's very hard to get lost
in America these days,

765
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,569
and it's even harder to stay lost.

766
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,281
So, we have that on our side. What?

767
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,783
We're doing a pretty goddamn good job
of being lost.

768
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,661
Because at this point,
when you're not home today,

769
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:38,330
when l'm not home today,
people are going to start noticing.

770
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:40,583
Like, my girlfriend
is definitely going to notice

771
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:43,210
that l'm not back today,
and that I haven't fucking called.

772
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:44,879
l mean, if I called, it would be one thing.

773
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,215
But, you know, if I just get back,
like, don't get back, period,

774
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:49,717
and I don't call, she's going to notice.

775
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:53,012
Which means that by tonight,
if we haven't found shit,

776
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:54,680
someone's going to be looking for us.

777
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:55,806
Oh, no.

778
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,516
Don't come this way. Go another way.

779
00:37:57,517 --> 00:38:02,195
Go down there. I just
got my whole shit wet.

780
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:07,443
Oh, shit. Well, let's try it this way.

781
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:12,914
l don't think you want to try this way.
l think you want to try the other way.

782
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:18,203
lf we didn't have these fucking packs,
it would be so much easier.

783
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:19,705
-l don't mean to laugh.
-Dude, my feet are wet.

784
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:23,591
Are you... ls that Michael laughing?

785
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:29,798
-Shut the fuck up and cross the stream.
-He's laughing.

786
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:33,851
Michael, that is the first time
l've heard you laugh in days.

787
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:38,974
l'm really happy you find it very amusing

788
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,768
that l'm going to be
incredibly uncomfortable

789
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:43,145
for the rest of the day.

790
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:46,315
Dude, uncomfortable just does not even...

791
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:48,609
Can we keep going, please?

792
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,695
No, we're going to chill out.

793
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,863
l thought you wanted to get to the car.

794
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,366
Oh, boy!

795
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:59,328
-Okay, come on. Let's get up here.
-Oh, shit.

796
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,206
You guys weren't lying to me
about the map, were you?

797
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:03,874
'Cause this just seems like
you guys are having

798
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,668
just a little bit too
much fun for my taste.

799
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:08,170
-Heather.
-No, we're just going a little stir-crazy.

800
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:11,674
Heather, Heather,
if you make me yell at this point,

801
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:13,509
l'm going to have to yell at you, man.

802
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,138
Come on, seriously, if you have the map,
l just want to know that you have it.

803
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:20,391
That would just make me happy,
just to know that you have it.

804
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,059
Heather...

805
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,436
lf I know that you have it,
and I can at least see it,

806
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:27,697
l will feel much better.

807
00:39:29,943 --> 00:39:31,986
Like, all we're trying to do
is be cool with you.

808
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,612
l find it very cool that I get laughed at

809
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:35,197
because my shoes are wet
for the rest of the day.

810
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:38,624
l find it fucking hilarious.

811
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:46,208
Heather, dude, all our shoes are wet.
We were laughing at the situation.

812
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,335
-Fine.
-We're fucking hungry, we're fucking tired.

813
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:49,670
What the hell else are we supposed

814
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:51,380
-to do at this point?
-You know what?

815
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:55,551
l kicked the...
l'm sorry, it's fucked up, it's fucked up.

816
00:39:55,552 --> 00:40:00,347
But I kicked that fucking map
into the creek yesterday.

817
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,057
lt was useless.

818
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:05,735
l kicked that fucker into the creek.

819
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,276
l fucking hope he's kidding.

820
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,611
-Mike?
-Holy shit.

821
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,989
-l really fucking hope he's kidding.
-Mike, are you kidding?

822
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,450
-l really fucking hope he's kidding.
-Mike, are you fucking kidding?

823
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,368
l'm sorry, man. l'm sorry.

824
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,828
You've got to be kidding me.

825
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,998
-You have got to fucking be kidding me!
-You think this is a fucking game?

826
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,624
-Get the fuck off me, man.
-What the fuck?

827
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,376
Are you out of your fucking mind?

828
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,587
No, l'm not out of my mind!
That map wasn't doing shit for us.

829
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:33,088
Do you realize... Not to you,

830
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:36,425
-but I knew what the fuck that map said!
-l'm sorry!

831
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:39,261
-You are a fucking asshole!
-l'm sorry.

832
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:43,223
-You're a fucking asshole! And if we...
-That map wasn't doing shit all day!

833
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:46,602
lf we get hurt or we die out here,
it's your fucking fault!

834
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:51,197
lt is your fucking fault!
Do you understand?

835
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:55,152
l can't believe
you could be such an asshole!

836
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,280
-What the fuck were you thinking?
-You're just fucking with my shit here!

837
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,115
Okay, no... l'm not, l'm not...

838
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,451
-That map was useless!
-lf this was your own...

839
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,787
-That map was useless!
-lt was useless to you!

840
00:41:04,788 --> 00:41:07,623
Okay... Okay.

841
00:41:07,624 --> 00:41:09,958
This is not
why I brought you out here, man.

842
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,961
-Okay. Okay.
-l'm sorry about the map, man.

843
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,171
-What can I say?
-"Sorry"?

844
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,215
-The map wasn't doing shit.
-Please, just don't say "sorry."

845
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,509
The map was not worth shit to you.
l knew exactly

846
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,636
-where we were on that map.
-lt wasn't worth shit to both of you.

847
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:22,137
-l asked you...
-l knew exactly where we were

848
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:23,388
-on that map!
-Listen to me!

849
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:25,349
Yesterday, I asked you
what fucking river we were on...

850
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,975
You shut up
or l'm going to fucking stick your head...

851
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:29,394
Turn this fucking camera off!

852
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:32,397
Give me the compass.

853
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:35,651
You've betrayed us all beyond...
Way fucking beyond...

854
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:37,820
-Bullshit, man.
-Give me the compass.

855
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,155
You betrayed us when you couldn't
get us out of the woods last night.

856
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:42,908
Yeah, thanks.

857
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:44,493
-Can I hold the fucking compass now?
-No!

858
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:47,621
-Can I hold the fucking compass?
-No.

859
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:48,664
l bought the compass.

860
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:50,457
-lf you wanted a compass...
-l don't give a shit.

861
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,667
You should have bought
your own fucking compass.

862
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:53,168
You fucked us up. He fucked us up.

863
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:55,462
-l don't know why you can't admit...
-Let's just keep walking south.

864
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:57,631
...that you've been screwed from
the moment we got out here, man.

865
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:59,883
Because I haven't! Because I haven't.

866
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:08,684
Why are we stopped?

867
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,812
-Does... Does anybody have a...
-Just don't. Just don't.

868
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:13,522
Does anybody have a reason
why we're stopped?

869
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:16,866
That's all l'm asking you.

870
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:21,572
What about the plan to keep going south?
We all seemed very happy with that plan.

871
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:25,332
Why is that not a thing anymore?

872
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:31,172
Jesus Christ.

873
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:37,212
-What?
-There's all sorts of stuff down here!

874
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:41,348
-What kind of stuff?
-Like, voodoo shit.

875
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:44,386
-What?
-Like, voodoo stuff.

876
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:47,855
-lt's hanging all over. Look around you.
-No way.

877
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,942
-They're all over the place.
-Holy shit.

878
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,355
Come up here, quick! I need to use the CP.

879
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,567
Yeah, there's all sorts
of shit up here, man.

880
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:01,952
This is fucking crazy shit.

881
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:08,167
-Please, I got to get this on 16.
-Take the fucking camera.

882
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:15,216
-What the fuck is this?
-l have no idea.

883
00:43:56,626 --> 00:44:01,428
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

884
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:08,477
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

885
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:13,141
-Can we get out of here now?
-Yeah, please?

886
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:15,352
Okay, l've got everything on video, man.

887
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:18,981
Jesus Christ, I didn't even
fucking see these, man.

888
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:20,065
That's it, Heather.

889
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:21,984
Heather, you've got enough, man. Let's go.

890
00:44:21,985 --> 00:44:24,444
-That's enough!
-Stop taping! Please, stop taping!

891
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:25,862
-We've got it! lt's enough!
-Okay.

892
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,824
Okay, okay, okay, we're leaving right now.

893
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:33,912
Okay. Okay, we're out of here.
We're out of here. l'm leaving.

894
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:35,205
Come on! Turn it off!

895
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:40,593
Help! Help!

896
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,554
Please, help us!

897
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:45,215
Help us!

898
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,301
This is not the way to get out of here.

899
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:51,013
Fuck!

900
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:55,559
l think it's safe to say at this point
that we're lost,

901
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,478
and I don't know what to do.

902
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:01,106
l think we should all get inside the tent.

903
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:02,190
All right.

904
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,735
Let's not light a fire tonight.

905
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:07,821
-Yeah. -Because two nights
in a row we've lit a fire.

906
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:09,364
We didn't light one the first night...

907
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:10,741
-And nothing happened.
-...and nothing happened.

908
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,869
We light fires, they know.
l haven't heard anything follow us.

909
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,954
-We should even turn that light off, too.
-All right. All right.

910
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:19,374
Seriously, man. Anything that's going
to attract attention to us at this point.

911
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:23,344
Okay. Let's just go to sleep.

912
00:45:26,966 --> 00:45:29,475
What's going on?

913
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:39,026
Oh, God.

914
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:45,699
What's that sound?

915
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:05,636
Jesus!

916
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:09,299
-Jesus Christ, what if it's...
-What was that?

917
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,801
-Jesus Christ.
-l'm going to put jeans on.

918
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,177
Jesus! Jesus!

919
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:13,929
Take the video camera.
No, get the DAT ready.

920
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,149
l'm going to take the video camera.
l'm gonna record this shit.

921
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:26,490
Oh, dear God! Oh, dear God!

922
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,865
Go! Fucking go!

923
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:36,243
Oh, God!

924
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:39,586
God! Fucking God!

925
00:46:40,373 --> 00:46:42,791
-Hurry up!
-l'm coming!

926
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:45,252
My boots aren't laced.

927
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:47,963
Oh, my God! What the fuck is that?

928
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:51,098
What the fuck is that?

929
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,065
Shit!

930
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,026
Oh, my God!

931
00:47:05,982 --> 00:47:08,400
Mike, where are you going?

932
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,909
Holy shit.

933
00:47:17,285 --> 00:47:19,953
Turn the lights off. Turn the lights off.

934
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:23,964
Turn that light off. Turn it off, Josh.

935
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:33,140
All lights off. All lights off.

936
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:38,638
-l'm soaking.
-lt's okay.

937
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,267
What's that? What the fuck is going on?

938
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:45,611
What the fuck is going on?

939
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:51,568
Did you hear that baby screaming?

940
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,904
Shut the fuck up.
There's no fucking baby out there.

941
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,156
-Yes, there was.
-There's no fucking baby out there.

942
00:47:56,157 --> 00:47:59,625
Okay. Okay. Okay.

943
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:05,005
l haven't heard anything since we ran away.

944
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,710
Oh, my God, it's cold.

945
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:11,379
-We should be quiet, okay?
-Okay, okay.

946
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,389
We should be quiet.

947
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:24,650
l don't hear anything anymore.
Maybe we should go back.

948
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:27,938
How long have we been here?

949
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:31,448
l don't know. A fucking hour.

950
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:35,369
The sun's up. We're okay now.

951
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:37,531
Let's just get back. Let's pack shit up.

952
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:40,624
-Let's get out.
-Okay.

953
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:44,746
What the fuck, man?

954
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:48,542
-Where's my pack?
-Your pack is right there. Where's my pack?

955
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:51,552
What the fuck, man?

956
00:48:57,593 --> 00:49:00,470
How come we're getting
fucked with like this?

957
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,597
They just opened it up.

958
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:06,977
-They spilled all my fucking water.
-That looks like slime, man.

959
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,979
lt's just water, man.

960
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,606
-lt is slime. What the fuck is that?
-lt's slime, dude.

961
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:12,941
Let's get this shit packed up
and get out of here.

962
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:15,777
-Come on, Heather. Turn that thing off.
-Heather, come on, let's go.

963
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,153
Heather, let's move it.

964
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,488
l'm not interested in anything anymore.
Let's go.

965
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,283
-l know! I know!
-So, turn it off.

966
00:49:21,284 --> 00:49:24,869
Just relax for just a second.
Have we gotten everything here?

967
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,871
-Like I give a shit.
-Whose shit was thrown around?

968
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:30,507
-Who specifically?
-lt's my shit!

969
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:32,627
-My shit.
-Why you?

970
00:49:32,628 --> 00:49:35,171
Let's go! Let's go.
Are you not scared enough?

971
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,423
No, but why you?

972
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:38,967
-Put the camera down. This is not funny.
-l'm coming.

973
00:49:38,968 --> 00:49:41,303
Do I look like l'm laughing at all?

974
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:44,347
No, but you're going around
doing your documentary thing, man.

975
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,683
-You're still doing your fucking thing.
-Don't fucking...

976
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,977
Then turn the goddamn thing off!

977
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:52,981
lf you bite me one more time,
l will throw you in the fucking woods.

978
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:54,149
You touch my camera one more time,

979
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,317
-l'll bite you again.
-Turn that thing off!

980
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:57,986
-Sorry.
-l didn't mean it, okay?

981
00:49:57,987 --> 00:50:00,739
-Are you all right?
-l'm fine. I just...

982
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,992
l want to go home, but it's important...
l just want to get what we can.

983
00:50:03,993 --> 00:50:06,793
What the fuck?

984
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,497
ls this possible?

985
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:12,167
Okay, all right.

986
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,627
Here I go.

987
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:16,588
l hate crossing streams on logs.

988
00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:20,175
lf I never cross another stream
on a log for the rest of my life,

989
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:23,226
l will die a happy girl.

990
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:28,106
l see why you like
this video camera so much.

991
00:50:28,184 --> 00:50:32,194
-You do?
-lt's not quite reality.

992
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,900
Reality says we got to move.

993
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:41,411
No, but it's totally like
a filtered reality, man.

994
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:46,959
lt's like you can pretend
everything's not quite the way it is.

995
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:50,372
Just leave him alone for now.

996
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:53,375
-We need to go.
-Just leave him alone for five minutes.

997
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:56,002
-Mike...
-Just leave him alone.

998
00:50:56,003 --> 00:51:00,013
Five minutes. Come on. He's lost it.

999
00:51:00,132 --> 00:51:01,716
l know that, but we're all on the brink

1000
00:51:01,717 --> 00:51:04,010
-of losing it.
-l know we are.

1001
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:05,970
-We got to take care of each other.
-l know.

1002
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:07,389
And there's no way we're taking care of him

1003
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,225
if we're going to throw the camera
in his face if he's crying.

1004
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:12,352
-l know that.
-l know you know.

1005
00:51:12,353 --> 00:51:14,062
l know we're both about to lose it,

1006
00:51:14,063 --> 00:51:16,940
-but let's try and keep the last
wits we have. -We have to...

1007
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:18,817
l understand we have to go.
Believe me, I know.

1008
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:21,653
lt's hard for all of us to hold it together.
We need to get out of here

1009
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:23,405
-in one piece, and this is not helping.
-l know this.

1010
00:51:23,406 --> 00:51:25,990
You're not telling me
anything I don't know.

1011
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:29,786
-Just let him have his...
-Does anybody have a cigarette?

1012
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:33,248
-No, man.
-No, there's none left.

1013
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:35,333
Nobody has any cigarettes?

1014
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:37,968
We're out.

1015
00:51:39,422 --> 00:51:44,426
What the fuck was this blue jelly shit
all over my shit?

1016
00:51:44,427 --> 00:51:47,971
Let's go. Let's go.

1017
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:51,725
lf we keep going south, we will get out.

1018
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:54,102
Please.

1019
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:57,939
l don't want to set up camp
another fucking night, man.

1020
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,734
-Josh, none of us do.
-l know. I know you don't.

1021
00:52:00,735 --> 00:52:04,195
Whatever it is, is going to come back.
We know that for a fact.

1022
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:05,488
We don't know that for a fact.

1023
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:08,408
lt came three nights in a row,
and it's getting worse every night.

1024
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:11,035
l would love to hear this right now.
l really would.

1025
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:14,456
l'm just trying to say that,
you know, we have to

1026
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:16,374
-rationally say...
-l know.

1027
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:20,503
They might very well go on forever
compared to our footsteps.

1028
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,505
Not possible.

1029
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,675
-Not possible in this country.
-Why is it not possible?

1030
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,802
Because this is America
and it's not possible.

1031
00:52:27,803 --> 00:52:29,804
We've destroyed
most of our natural resources.

1032
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:32,105
Let's just keep going.

1033
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:56,088
No, that's the tree we crossed.
That tree is down. That's the same one.

1034
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,043
-Oh, God!
-No. Oh, no.

1035
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:03,671
You've got to be kidding me!
This is a joke!

1036
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:07,300
-No...
-This is not funny!

1037
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:09,344
Mike, just please stop.

1038
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:11,346
Please... Please stop.

1039
00:53:11,347 --> 00:53:14,064
Please stop.

1040
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,850
-Please stop.
-Oh, no!

1041
00:53:15,851 --> 00:53:19,736
No. No, Mike, it's not the same log.

1042
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:22,190
-lt's not the same log, Mike.
-lt's the same one!

1043
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:25,527
-Look, it's not.
-lt is! Open your eyes!

1044
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:28,703
lt's not the same log.

1045
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:31,866
lt's not...

1046
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:34,702
lt's not the same log.

1047
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:37,129
Fuck.

1048
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:43,795
-Fuck!
-lt's the same log.

1049
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:45,964
-Fuck!
-Fuck!

1050
00:53:45,965 --> 00:53:48,633
lt's the same log.

1051
00:53:48,634 --> 00:53:51,386
Fuck you, God!

1052
00:53:51,387 --> 00:53:54,354
lt's the same log.

1053
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:02,063
Okay.

1054
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:08,577
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1055
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:12,907
Where do you want to go to camp?
l guess today south didn't work out,

1056
00:54:12,908 --> 00:54:17,537
so tomorrow we'll go east.
l don't know what to say, Josh.

1057
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:19,956
How the fuck did we walk south
all day and wind up...

1058
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:24,252
We've walked south all day, okay?
We walked south all fucking day.

1059
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:27,387
l don't know how we ended up here.

1060
00:54:33,554 --> 00:54:38,064
Do you expect me to do something
or say something?

1061
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:48,575
What do you want to do, Josh?

1062
00:54:53,115 --> 00:54:55,540
Josh?

1063
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:02,839
l want to make movies, Heather.

1064
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:07,761
lsn't that what we're here to do?

1065
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:11,723
-Let's make some movies.
-Fuck you.

1066
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,303
Fuck you. Really. Fuck you.

1067
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:17,639
Please, let's not fight. Please.

1068
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,601
Come on, I can't. I can't listen to fighting.
l can't fight.

1069
00:55:21,602 --> 00:55:24,812
We're screwed and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

1070
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:27,489
Both of you.

1071
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:30,818
l'll do the first watch.

1072
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:33,787
l got first watch.

1073
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,498
-Come on, you can do better than that.
-This is not the place or the time, guys.

1074
00:55:43,499 --> 00:55:46,042
-We have things to prepare for here.
-Okay, here's your motivation.

1075
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,879
You're lost, you're angry in the woods,
and no one here is here to help you.

1076
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,048
There's a fucking witch
and she keeps leaving shit

1077
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,383
-outside your door.
-Josh.

1078
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:56,260
There's no one here to help you.
She left little trinkets.

1079
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:57,845
-Josh.
-You fucking took one of them.

1080
00:55:57,846 --> 00:55:59,931
She ran after us.
There's no one here to help you.

1081
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:02,934
-Josh!
-We walked for 15 hours today.

1082
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:04,852
We ended up in the same place.

1083
00:56:04,853 --> 00:56:06,270
-There's no one here to help you.
-Just stop.

1084
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:07,522
-Josh!
-That's your motivation!

1085
00:56:07,523 --> 00:56:09,524
Would you please stop?

1086
00:56:09,525 --> 00:56:12,318
That's your motivation.

1087
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,406
-Please stop.
-Josh. Just quit it.

1088
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:18,574
-She's had enough.
-Please stop.

1089
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,618
Come on, man, you got her back. Good one.

1090
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:23,162
No, she's still making movies, man.
That's my point.

1091
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:24,872
-Please stop.
-This is my point here.

1092
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:28,626
lt's all I fucking have left, okay?
Just please stop.

1093
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:31,004
Please stop.

1094
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:35,015
Just please stop yelling at me, please.

1095
00:56:38,971 --> 00:56:42,515
Come on, l'm fucking tired
of crying all day here.

1096
00:56:42,516 --> 00:56:45,309
We got to think like human beings.
We have things to prepare for.

1097
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:49,404
We got to make shifts. We got lots to do.

1098
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,872
You going to write us
a happy ending, Heather?

1099
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,875
Come on, man, turn it off.

1100
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:13,386
You're getting like she was.
Come on, turn it off.

1101
00:57:15,924 --> 00:57:19,469
Dude, I can't believe we're even
stitching those pants at this point, man.

1102
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,929
Well, l'm cold, man.

1103
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,765
-l know.
-l hear you.

1104
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:26,809
-l know.
-The smallest comforts we can get are good.

1105
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,604
Doesn't it just seem absurd, though,
at this point?

1106
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:31,105
Yes, it does.

1107
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:33,441
A lot of things seem absurd.

1108
00:57:33,442 --> 00:57:36,736
Like sleeping right where we were
pretty much sleeping last night.

1109
00:57:36,737 --> 00:57:40,573
That's just fucking me up, period.

1110
00:57:40,574 --> 00:57:44,709
That's just fucked up, man. That's just...

1111
00:57:47,873 --> 00:57:51,459
-l'm sorry, man.
-You chill. lt's all right.

1112
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,004
-l'm sorry, Heather.
-lt's okay.

1113
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,757
Who wants a cheeseburger?

1114
00:57:57,758 --> 00:57:59,967
l do. I do.

1115
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:04,646
-l got a cheeseburger in my back pocket.
-Do you?

1116
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,849
Can I have a light to cut this?

1117
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,685
-You know what I fucking love?
-What?

1118
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,396
Mashed potatoes.

1119
00:58:12,397 --> 00:58:14,948
Me, too.

1120
00:58:16,068 --> 00:58:19,661
My mom's mashed potatoes.

1121
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:26,793
You'll have them again very soon.

1122
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,089
My mom's mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

1123
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:34,300
Josh!

1124
00:58:36,797 --> 00:58:39,590
Fuck, Mike, we never go out of earshot.

1125
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:43,226
-Josh!
-Hold on, calm down.

1126
00:58:43,971 --> 00:58:45,680
How could l...

1127
00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:54,481
Josh!

1128
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:56,524
He's probably at the river or something.

1129
00:58:56,525 --> 00:58:59,026
lf he was at the river,
he could hear me from here.

1130
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:02,078
-Josh!
-Josh!

1131
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:06,659
Got to wait for him to respond.

1132
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,004
-Do you remember what he said yesterday?
-What?

1133
00:59:11,623 --> 00:59:15,758
About the shit on his bag, about how...

1134
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:18,796
Josh!

1135
00:59:18,797 --> 00:59:22,049
Let's go. We got to find him.

1136
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,385
-Come on.
-We can't even find the car!

1137
00:59:24,386 --> 00:59:26,637
How the fuck are we going to find Josh?

1138
00:59:26,638 --> 00:59:27,972
Heather, come on.

1139
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:29,891
-No. No.
-Come on, come on.

1140
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,100
-l'm fine.
-Come here, come on.

1141
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,894
Relax, relax.

1142
00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:34,729
All right, we'll relax.
We'll break down the tent.

1143
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,274
When he's back, we'll be ready to go, okay?

1144
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,650
l'm losing my mind, Mike.

1145
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:43,369
-Josh hasn't come back.
-Heather!

1146
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:47,207
-l'm over here, Mike.
-Okay.

1147
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:52,545
l don't know if Josh ran off. I don't...

1148
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:55,673
All his shit's here.

1149
00:59:55,918 --> 00:59:58,377
l've got the camera.

1150
00:59:58,378 --> 01:00:01,589
l don't know how the fuck
l'm going to hike with that camera, but...

1151
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,424
You sure you want to
take the fucking camera?

1152
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:06,761
We've got to take the camera.

1153
01:00:06,762 --> 01:00:13,858
How do you feel about east?

1154
01:00:14,436 --> 01:00:17,737
Well, south didn't work.

1155
01:00:18,023 --> 01:00:19,232
Which wicked witch was worse,

1156
01:00:19,233 --> 01:00:23,653
The Wicked Witch of the East
or The Wicked Witch of the West?

1157
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:26,614
The Wicked Witch of the West
was the bad one.

1158
01:00:26,615 --> 01:00:29,958
Well, let's go east.

1159
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,622
What the hell's that?

1160
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:37,006
Josh?

1161
01:00:37,584 --> 01:00:39,968
Josh!

1162
01:00:40,963 --> 01:00:44,764
We're going to put up the tent now.

1163
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,769
l'm going to have a meatball.

1164
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,564
-Just one meatball?
-And a long, red glass of wine.

1165
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:03,776
Yeah, I would definitely
have a whole fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

1166
01:01:03,777 --> 01:01:05,987
And a fresh pack of smokes.

1167
01:01:05,988 --> 01:01:09,573
Smokes would be good,
and a long, hot bath.

1168
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:10,992
And a big pumpkin pie.

1169
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:14,711
A big pumpkin pie. With ice cream?

1170
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,000
-Warm, with melty ice cream.
-Yeah, that sounds good.

1171
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:23,261
What's your favorite thing
to do on a Sunday?

1172
01:01:23,797 --> 01:01:27,508
lt used to be drive to the woods
and go hiking.

1173
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:31,178
But I think that...

1174
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:36,149
-That might change now.
-l think you can scratch that off.

1175
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:47,035
Oh, God.

1176
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:52,074
Should we go for him?

1177
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:54,876
ls it a trick?

1178
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,678
Josh?

1179
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:08,681
Josh!

1180
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:15,730
-lt's stopped.
-Josh!

1181
01:02:19,686 --> 01:02:22,862
Where's it coming from?

1182
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:33,915
Josh!

1183
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:39,712
Josh, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

1184
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:44,509
Oh, my God!

1185
01:02:45,003 --> 01:02:47,345
No.

1186
01:02:48,173 --> 01:02:51,349
Fuck. Oh, God.

1187
01:02:51,593 --> 01:02:54,261
Do you think that it's
them fucking with us?

1188
01:02:54,262 --> 01:02:56,305
l don't know.

1189
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,731
Josh!

1190
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:04,529
-ls it over here?
-No, it's over here.

1191
01:03:04,773 --> 01:03:08,157
Josh!

1192
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:17,333
We'll look for him.

1193
01:03:28,588 --> 01:03:32,133
l don't know if it's really him.
l don't know if it's really him.

1194
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:34,559
Josh!

1195
01:03:44,396 --> 01:03:47,523
l don't even know where to look.

1196
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:49,991
Josh!

1197
01:03:51,486 --> 01:03:54,996
Tell me where you are, Josh!

1198
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,909
Mike?

1199
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,296
-Please don't fall asleep.
-l can't fall asleep.

1200
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:10,219
Whatever it is, knows that Josh is gone.

1201
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:19,228
lf that was Josh,
he would have said where he was.

1202
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:25,985
Whatever it was, sounded like Josh.

1203
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:28,988
See.

1204
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:32,902
l just want to show that Mike is here.

1205
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:35,703
He's sleeping.

1206
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:44,253
Oh, shit.

1207
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:49,884
What the hell is that?

1208
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:54,430
-Mike?
-What?

1209
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:58,184
There's something out here.

1210
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:07,693
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1211
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:10,564
Okay, l'm just going to move it
from the front of the tent.

1212
01:05:10,565 --> 01:05:14,527
-Get rid of it.
-Okay. l'm taking it away.

1213
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:18,656
l'm taking it away from
the front of the tent.

1214
01:05:18,657 --> 01:05:21,874
l'm just throwing it.

1215
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:26,045
Okay.

1216
01:05:26,331 --> 01:05:28,541
We'll just keep walking.

1217

l found them all the way
at the bottom of my pack.

1221
01:05:38,677 --> 01:05:41,053
Which means we're still alive,
'cause we're smoking.

1222
01:05:41,054 --> 01:05:43,396
Okay.

1223

and see what's in here.

My hair's caught.

Thank you. Thank you.

1249
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:49,582
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1250
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:35,329
2, 130 games,

1251
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:39,298
one more season and Cal Ripken is king!

1252
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:43,052
Cal Ripken is king!

1253
01:09:43,254 --> 01:09:46,006
And I won't get to see it

1254
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:49,433
'cause I'll be in the woods!

1255
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,326
Tell me you're not eating a dry leaf.

1256
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:21,006
l just want to apologize

1257
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:28,764
to Mike's mom and Josh's mom
and my mom...

1258
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,770
And l'm sorry to everyone.

1259
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:39,024
l was very naive.

1260
01:10:42,397 --> 01:10:49,869
l am so, so sorry
for everything that has happened

1261
01:10:50,572 --> 01:10:55,708
because in spite of what Mike says now,
it is my fault

1262
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:59,204
because it was my project

1263
01:10:59,205 --> 01:11:02,131
and I insisted.

1264
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:05,252
l insisted on everything.

1265
01:11:05,253 --> 01:11:08,888
l insisted that we weren't lost.

1266
01:11:09,424 --> 01:11:12,933
l insisted that we keep going.

1267
01:11:13,011 --> 01:11:16,562
l insisted that we walk south.

1268
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,183
Everything had to be my way

1269
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:23,770
and this is where we've ended up.

1270
01:11:23,771 --> 01:11:27,399
And it's all because of me
that we're here now,

1271
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,202
hungry and cold

1272
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:34,705
and hunted.

1273
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:43,589
l love you, Mom and Dad.

1274
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:48,594
l am so sorry.

1275
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,518
What is that?

1276
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:11,234
l'm scared to close my eyes.

1277
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:14,495
l'm scared to open them.

1278
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:22,663
Oh, God.

1279
01:12:22,664 --> 01:12:26,006
l'm going to die out here.

1280
01:12:28,795 --> 01:12:31,546
-You got it?
-You ready?

1281
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,006
Somebody!

1282
01:12:33,007 --> 01:12:37,101
-Jesus Christ.
-Please don't go out there.

1283
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:47,145
-Okay.
-You ready?

Please, follow my voice!

1288
01:13:34,027 --> 01:13:37,578
