3
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,292
Father,
do you have a name for this sword?

4
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,167
It's called "The Ultimate Sword"

5
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,708
the best sword I've made in my life!

6
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,167
Which is better -
martial arts or a good sword?

7
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,458
A good sword can...

8
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:37,125
help a novice

9
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:41,542
And make an expert really powerful

10
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:45,125
But most important is
who is using the sword

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,833
Cloud, remember:

12
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,292
Kindness is invincible!

13
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:07,833
Lord Conquer has led Conquer's Clan

14
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,917
to the strong position it is today

15
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:16,167
Mud Buddha, you are praising yourself

16
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,583
You are in charge of the geomancy here,

17
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,542
and if we do well, so will you

18
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,542
I hope so

19
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,833
Jester, you are Lord Conquers right hand

20
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,208
Truly a servant of one,
master of thousands

21
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,917
Its a dangerous way of living

22
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,083
We always envy each other

23
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,875
His Lordship has been waiting all day

24
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,208
Greetings, Lord! Greetings, my Lord!

25
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,167
You've come

26
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:20,833
You know me well

27
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:27,542
How will I do in my duel
with Sword Saint?

28
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,292
My Lords martial arts skill will
find no match in the world

29
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,833
Neither No Name in the south nor...

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,167
Sword Saint in the north

31
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,292
are worthy opponents

32
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,417
Mud Buddha,

33
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,083
you talk like Jester

34
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:50,417
Lord, I didn't teach him to sweet talk

35
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:55,583
If I can defeat Sword Saint,

36
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,000
Conquer's Clan will rule the world

37
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,167
But I can tell you, my Lord...

38
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:10,125
You may have to wait ten years
for the duel with Sword Saint

39
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,625
Why do you say that?

40
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,250
The time has not yet come

41
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,667
My Lord, a gift for you

42
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,458
What is it?

43
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,625
"When the Wind and Cloud combine,

44
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,292
the Fish with Golden Scales
becomes a Dragon"

45
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,125
These two birth charts

46
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,250
are of the two disciples you will have

47
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,250
One is named Wind

48
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,833
The other is named Cloud

49
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,417
Wind and Cloud?

50
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:03,833
The wind is formless

51
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:09,625
The cloud is unpredictable

52
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,625
As to...

53
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,833
how to find them,

54
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:19,625
that depends on your fate

55
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,125
And after I find them?

56
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:31,083
You will be invincible
for the first half of your life

57
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,333
And the last half?

58
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,667
Find Wind and Cloud first

59
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,042
Jester

60
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,875
Yes, my Lord

61
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,667
Use whatever means necessary

62
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,500
I must find Wind and Cloud

63
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,667
Yes, my Lord

64
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,833
This is a Persian treasure,

65
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:12,583
it is called the Ying Yang Magic Box

66
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,292
It has 108 Celestial Stems
and Terrestrial Branches

67
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,458
My Lord is so intelligent,

68
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,292
if you can find...

69
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,417
the correct combination

70
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,833
the box will open

71
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:38,292
It holds the answer to
the second half of your life

72
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,042
I will

73
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,958
then be able to give you an explanation

74
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:48,250
Do not use force to open this box

75
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,583
If you do...

76
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,833
the box will explode

77
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,583
and all will be destroyed

78
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,458
Good!

79
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,833
I, Conquer, can certainly open this box

80
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,000
Out of my way! Go away!

81
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,250
"By order of Conquer's Clan,

82
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,750
all boys with the listed birth chart

83
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,792
must become disciples of Conquer's Clan"

84
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,792
Master!

85
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,292
Master...

86
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,125
Conquers Clan seeks boys with
young masters birth chart

87
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,542
Do not let them know of Cloud

88
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,833
Yes, sir

89
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,125
Cloud

90
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,625
Come here

91
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,042
Wind, did you memorize
the Blizzard Rhyme I taught you?

92
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,833
Don't worry father, I remember

93
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,792
"When river reaches Buddha's knee,
Burning then will Cirrus Cave be"

94
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,833
Father, what does this mean?

95
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,375
This river floods all the time

96
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,375
Legend says,
when the Buddha's knees are flooded,

97
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,417
Cirrus Cave up in the mountains
will catch fire.

98
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,250
and the villages will be flooded too

99
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,958
Wind, I have carried you a long time

100
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,833
Why don't you get down and walk with me

101
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,625
I like the feeling of
being carried by you

102
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,000
Father, will we see mother on this trip?

103
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,292
Who told you, Wind?

104
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,083
I am already ten, no longer a child

105
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,667
Promise never to mention
your mother again

106
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,958
All women are trouble

107
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:28,042
Conquer. I have retired for many years

108
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,667
Why must you force me?

109
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,375
Fire Unicorn in the south,
Ice Blizzard in the north

110
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,500
My goal in life is to gather
the Worlds Ten Greatest Weapons

111
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,375
For you to posses the Blizzard Blade
is a crime punishable by death

112
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,125
I have already buried it in the hills

113
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,833
If you want to fight, well use bamboo

114
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,708
But if I win...

115
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,417
I'll choose between Blizzard Blade.
or your wife

116
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:18,828
If I loose todays duel...

117
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,500
You can have the Fire Unicorn Sword

118
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,208
You must pay for your madness!

119
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,250
Whispering Prince,
you're using bamboo today

120
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,708
It is only the first round

121
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,125
I'll give you two years

122
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,208
Bring Blizzard Blade to me then
at the Cirrus Cave

123
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,833
III take your wife for now

124
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,625
Wind, wait here for Father

125
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,792
Father, I hope you'll bring Mother

126
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,833
Its been sometime...

127
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,500
You're alone?

128
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:30,833
Ying

129
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,042
Husband

130
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,833
How have you been?

131
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,083
Very happy

132
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,125
Whispering Prince, don't you understand?

133
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:48,792
Ying wanted to come with me,

134
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,375
I never forced her

135
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,125
Ying!

136
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,083
Didn't you notice?

137
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,292
Ever since your retirement
to the countryside...

138
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,708
I have never smiled

139
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:10,458
I want a man to be celebrated hero

140
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,375
I want your humble visitors...

141
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,458
to adore me

142
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,833
Now I understand...

143
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,833
Only by robbing you of your love

144
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,417
I can make you fight back

145
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,833
I shall force you to use
the Blizzard Blade

146
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,208
Ill tell you a secret

147
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,875
I only used her

148
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,500
to vent my desires

149
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,833
I never loved her

150
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,333
Conquer, you are despicable!

151
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,417
Mother!

152
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,167
Wind!
Mother, I miss you

153
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
We will fight to the death,

154
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,333
but I have one request from you

155
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,125
Speak

156
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,000
I have only one son, Whispering Wind

157
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,000
If I die, please let him live

158
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, I promise you

159
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:35,833
I have dishonoured you and your father

160
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,833
Mother!

161
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,917
Mother! Don't!

162
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,458
Mother...

163
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,083
Father!

164
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,792
Father...

165
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,750
Father!

166
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,583
Wind, run! Don't worry about me!

167
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,000
No, I wont run away!

168
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:09,125
Run! Hurry! Father...

169
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,292
What have we Stridings done to you?

170
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,667
Why do you destroy my homestead?

171
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,750
It is our Lord's order

172
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,000
Hand over your son
and the Ultimate Sword

173
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,292
Give it to Conquer's Clan
and we will spare you

174
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,000
I'd rather die than surrender!

175
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,250
We'll find the sword

176
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,208
after we kill you all

177
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,167
I have hidden it

178
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:06,292
Even if you find it,

179
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,500
you cannot use it without it touching
my blood or that of my son's

180
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,667
There's a child

181
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,833
Is he Striding Sky's son?

182
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,917
Perhaps not, he isn't crying at all

183
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,833
Take the child and all the swords

184
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:39,750
Yes

185
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,833
Where is Father? Where is my father?

186
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,625
Calm down!

187
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,417
My father brought you here

188
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,833
or you would've been eaten by wolves

189
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,833
Curious? This is Conquer's Clan

190
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,292
I'm Charity, daughter of Lord Conquer
He's Frost

191
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,708
You've fainted for two days

192
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,083
Have some tea
I'll take you to eat later

193
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,417
Isn't it too hot?

194
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,583
My Lord's brilliance will

195
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,750
unite Heaven and Earth...

196
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,583
These three years,
the Clan has gone far

197
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,000
We are the greatest Clan now

198
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:48,167
I am naming heirs to
further strengthen us

199
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,875
Frost.

200
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,458
Cloud and Wind will be
my closest disciples

201
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,208
With their Frost Fists,
Cloud Palms and Wind Kicks

202
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,833
Conquer's Clan shall dominate
the martial arts world

203
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,750
My Lord's brilliance will unite Heaven and Earth

204
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,792
"Unable to meet in battle

205
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,917
Duel to death in ten years.
Sword Saint"

206
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:48,000
Mud Buddha. you are a true prophet

207
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,083
Why didn't you attack with
your full force?

208
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,000
Master's body is invaluable, I dare not

209
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,542
If I cannot handle your attacks,

210
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,042
then I deserve to die

211
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,500
Master Cloud,

212
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,458
His Lordship wishes to see you

213
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,125
and Master Wind

214
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,917
Bring the coloured stones to Charity

215
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:03,875
Yes

216
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:20,625
Come in

217
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,583
Charity, this is forbidden ground

218
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,292
We are not allowed to go in

219
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,958
To outsiders only,

220
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,833
but I'm Lord Conquer's daughter

221
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,167
This is the Sword Grave.
our sword storage

222
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,208
If not forbidden,
it may still be dangerous

223
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,625
That's why I asked you to go with me

224
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:41,833
I'll go in myself, cowards

225
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,375
You two go, III stand guard

226
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,500
See, you cherish me more

227
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go, Wind

228
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,375
Women are trouble

229
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,792
Look! Magic fire!

230
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,000
No, these are just firebugs

231
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,750
I'll take some home

232
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,458
Someone's coming. Let's go

233
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,625
Let's go

234
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:38,667
"With the unique powers of
Wind and Cloud,

235
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,875
Lord Conquer has obtained supremacy
and expanded his empire

236
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,542
With the strength of his martial arts,

237
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:50,083
Conquer has overcome all
but one of his rivals - Sword Saint

238
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,417
This prophecy is a gift from Mud Buddha

239
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,500
Together with another verse

240
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:06,625
I'll be able to find out my fate

241
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:14,833
That other verse is still locked
in this magic box

242
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:20,500
I have been unable to find
the right combination for ten years,

243
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,208
and Mud Buddha has disappeared
for ten years

244
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:31,125
Frost, Wind, I have lost my patience

245
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:36,042
Go and find Mud Buddha

246
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,292
Legend says...

247
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,208
In order to find Mud Buddha,
one must first seek the Fire Monkey

248
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,583
Use this clue in your search

249
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,292
Aren't you coming with us?

250
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,875
I am only a watchdog

251
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,500
Once I step outside these gates

252
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,828
III be doomed. Very fragile,

253
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,833
I cant take hardships

254
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:55,875
Jester!

255
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:02,875
Wind, your Wind Kick
lacks practical experience

256
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:06,208
Therefore, on this journey

257
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,792
be careful and obey Frost

258
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,833
I understand

259
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,542
Cloud,

260
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,833
You have a different mission

261
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,542
I await your orders

262
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,833
Fong in Unchallenged City wishes

263
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,833
to become our ally

264
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,125
I told him

265
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,833
I wanted his Unchallenged Sword
as a token

266
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,417
Its his birthday,
so go to Unchallenged City

267
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,125
I will bring back the Unchallenged Sword

268
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,708
I want more than that...

269
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,625
Bring back Fongs head

270
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,833
Can you do it?

271
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,458
Yes, Master

272
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:04,167
You have achieved 70% of your power
with your Cloud Palms

273
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,833
You can succeed.

274
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,542
with Hawks and Bats help

275
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,583
Father, I want to go, too

276
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,833
Charity, what is it?

277
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,750
If they can go, why can't I?

278
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,042
I see...

279
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,833
Would you like to go with Wind, or Cloud?

280
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,542
You are going to kill, leave me out

281
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,000
Wind, I'll go with you

282
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,417
Were not going to play

283
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,125
Neither am I

284
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,500
Well help out the weak and be heroes

285
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,917
These are not the teachings of the Clan

286
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,042
Jester, be quiet

287
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,167
Prepare to leave tomorrow

288
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,042
Yes Yes. Master

289
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,750
Charity, stay

290
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,875
Cloud

291
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,917
Have you been to the forbidden
Sword Grave with Charity?

292
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,833
Yes, but please don't tell Master

293
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,333
Chase me. Grandfather!

294
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,042
Little Pigtails, don't run!

295
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,250
Old Man, well be fighting here
Leave quickly

296
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,167
Surround him!

297
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:46,417
I respect you as a Shaolin monk

298
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,750
Give me the Fire Monkey!

299
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,833
What a pity

300
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,833
No one can turn down

301
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,667
an order from the Unchallenged City

302
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,625
"To find Mud Buddha,
first seek the Fire Monkey"

303
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,625
Why do you want to find Mud Buddha?

304
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,625
It is my fathers 60th birthday

305
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,208
I want Mud Buddha to wish him well

306
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,250
and tell him he will live
for a hundred years

307
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,000
Life is determined by fate

308
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,708
If Mud Buddha were to tell him

309
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,458
he will die on his birthday,

310
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,125
then what?

311
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,500
Nonsense!

312
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:27,667
Unchallenged City is at its strongest

313
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,500
Together with Conquer's Clan,
Father will rule the martial arts world

314
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:34,667
Soon, even you Shaolin monks will
have to let us have our way

315
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,625
Fire Monkey belongs to
the Shaolin Temple

316
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,833
Mud Buddha stole it.
so he must return it

317
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,792
If you refuse to hand it over.
you might not return to Shaolin!

318
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,250
I am Whispering Wind
Pardon my interference

319
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,208
Let's go

320
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,833
They're about to fight. Let's go

321
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,833
Old Man, stay and watch what happens

322
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,583
You don't know what is out there

323
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,167
It may be more dangerous

324
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,167
Who dares to be so arrogant?

325
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,875
What a pity

326
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,292
Wind Kick, Frost Fist

327
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,292
Don't you recognise
the Masters of Conquer's Clan?

328
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,958
I thought you are all one family

329
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,833
Sometimes,
quantity doesn't mean anything

330
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,583
We'll soon...

331
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,458
be one family

332
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,167
Why fight among yourselves?

333
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,583
Don't talk nonsense

334
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,833
Don't associate yourself with us

335
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,083
All of you against one monk?

336
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:54,542
You can't possibly be good men

337
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,042
You're saying
we take advantage of our numbers?

338
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,833
Frost, have we gone too far?

339
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:16,583
I don't think so
I've only disabled their powers

340
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,375
Buddha have pity!

341
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,833
Your Holiness, this is my first quest

342
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,125
Please make it easy on me
and lend me Fire Monkey

343
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:31,125
I promise to return it in a month

344
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,833
I told you it belongs to
the Shaolin Temple

345
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:35,625
If you must take it,

346
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,083
then how are you
any different from those people?

347
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,917
Without Fire Monkey,
we can't find Mud Buddha

348
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,750
What shall I tell my Master?

349
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,208
You too are looking for Mud Buddha?

350
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,042
You have no respect for me!

351
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:54,167
That's right!

352
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,167
Shut up!

353
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,833
Your Holiness, please help us
We need Fire Monkey

354
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,083
I'm sorry but I cannot oblige

355
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,833
Then, excuse us

356
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:22,833
Excuse us

357
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,250
Firey!

358
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,125
You can insult me some more if you want

359
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,750
Now that I have Fire Monkey. I'm leaving

360
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:39,833
Wind!

361
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,208
Forget him

362
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,292
Why?

363
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,125
We only needed the Fire Monkey
in order to find Mud Buddha

364
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,833
Now that he is already here,

365
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,083
why bother?

366
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,333
Sir, please do not disguise anymore

367
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,625
So you recognise me

368
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,833
I know
you're a famous master of disguise

369
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,583
To keep calm

370
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,708
in the face of such chaos...

371
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,042
you're no ordinary man,

372
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,750
and when the innocent girl

373
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,583
cried out to the monkey,

374
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,833
we knew

375
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,125
Grandpa, where are they taking Firey?

376
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:25,667
Don't worry, they won't hurt him

377
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,792
I revealed too many secrets
about the future

378
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:37,708
and was punished by heaven with boils
all over my body

379
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:43,167
Only Fire Monkey can suck out the poison

380
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
and ease my pain

381
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,833
Please bring it back to me

382
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:52,458
Don't worry, sir. We'll try our best

383
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,833
That's good to know

384
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,625
Let's go

385
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,625
Lord Conquer must be anxious to see me

386
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:04,833
After you

387
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,917
Master Fong, you are a great man

388
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,917
3,000 advisors
Loyal subjects everywhere

389
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,500
You have all good things one can desire

390
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,875
On this birthday

391
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,208
your only son Ming has given you

392
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,750
a 3-day banquet,

393
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,917
but why is he not here celebrating?

394
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,958
He's out...

395
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,292
looking for Mud Buddha

396
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,995
Has Conquers Clan sent anyone?

397
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,375
Not yet, Master

398
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,083
Young Master, mission complete

399
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,917
Master Fong looks very happy

400
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,417
Everyone
from Unchallenged City is there,

401
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,750
except his only son Ming

402
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,792
We'll strike at 4 am.

403
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,042
Yes, sir!

404
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,000
Who is it?

405
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,667
Forgive my intrusion

406
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,583
Oh, its Young Master Striding Cloud!

407
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,292
My master orders me to bring back
the Unchallenged Sword

408
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,458
People from Conquer's Clan are so vile!

409
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,625
Master, someone is still alive

410
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,708
Please don't kill me!

411
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,292
Finish the job

412
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,958
How did this happen?

413
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:04,667
Why? Why?

414
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,458
What good are you?

415
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,417
What good is Mud Buddha?

416
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,625
Fire Monkey is innocent. Don't punish it

417
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,417
Your Holiness

418
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,000
I beg Shaolin to seek justice...

419
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,042
Help me seek revenge, and justice

420
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:34,917
To kill all of Unchallenged City
in one night...

421
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:39,208
Only Conquer's Clan is powerful
enough to do this

422
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,833
Buddha have pity on us

423
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,000
Wind, what are you thinking about?

424
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,000
My father died here

425
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,042
Master rescued me

426
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,875
Legend says...

427
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,292
Blood Bodhi fruits grow in Cirrus Cave

428
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:08,000
They heal all diseases
and increase powers

429
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,792
But no one has successfully gone in...

430
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,333
and returned

431
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,583
They say a Fire Beast guards the fruit

432
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,542
Master Wind,

433
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,583
do you know anything about
your father's duel?

434
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,708
So you've heard about this?

435
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:37,833
Master said,
it was swordsman Southern Unicorn

436
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,667
He also died in the cave

437
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:45,000
Promise me one thing

438
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,208
Please tell us

439
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,500
Little Pigtails has lost her parents

440
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,458
I'm her only family

441
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,208
I want to help her find a foster home

442
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,458
Do you sense something wrong
about this journey?

443
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,333
When a buddha of mud crosses the river,

444
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:08,750
he cannot guarantee safety for himself

445
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,000
Father has been murdered

446
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,000
most brutally...

447
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,958
we are all
that's left of Unchallenged City

448
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,583
You must help us?

449
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,250
We have to avenge Unchallenged City
and my father

450
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:39,458
You must help me seek revenge.
Revenge!

451
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:22,000
That couple agreed to adopt
Little Pigtails

452
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,000
Master Wind is a kind person

453
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,083
If everyone in Conquers Clan
were like you,

454
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,375
the martial arts world would be at peace

455
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:38,000
How is Conquer's other disciple, Cloud?

456
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,167
Cloud is an unpredictable, moody loner

457
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,833
But his martial arts is
the best among us all

458
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:47,875
Exactly as destined

459
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,750
Grandpa!

460
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,458
Come back, Grandpa!

461
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:30,833
Grandpa!

462
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,000
Grandpa!

463
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,625
"The Dragon is powerful
but will be stranded

464
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:10,000
when Wind and Cloud become a storm"

465
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,292
Years ago, you left without a word

466
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:19,875
Leaving me with this piece of junk

467
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,250
Now that the puzzle is revealed

468
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,167
Explain what it means!

469
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:36,708
"Wind and Cloud will make you,
and break you as well"

470
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,708
What does that mean?

471
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,042
One cannot fight against his destiny

472
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:49,708
My Lord's ten years of good fortune
has passed

473
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It is now the turning point of your life

474
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:02,000
"Wind and Cloud will make you,
and break you as well"

475
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:07,000
Obviously, it means that my life is
now under the control of wind and cloud

476
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,208
But does that wind and cloud...

477
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:18,792
mean my disciples
Whispering Wind and Striding Cloud?

478
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,958
It is inevitable that
the servant will usurp the master

479
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:28,333
This is destiny. Mortals cannot fight it

480
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,000
Destiny?

481
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:40,083
I don't believe in destiny or fate

482
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:48,000
My Lord was a great believer until now

483
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,000
Mortals are like that

484
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:57,292
Believing in good fortunes,
but not believing in bad ones

485
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,708
Deceiving themselves!

486
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,375
We are the masters of our own destiny!

487
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,667
I hold my destiny in my own hands

488
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,458
I will change my fate!

489
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:40,667
"Cloud"

490
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,250
"Wi n d"

491
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Four famous weapons
of the martial arts world...

492
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:31,167
One blade. Three swords
All priceless treasures

493
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:37,000
Blizzard Blade is buried in Cirrus Cave

494
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:41,167
The Ultimate Sword has never been found

495
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:45,417
Fire Unicorn Sword
and the Unchallenged Sword

496
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,625
are both mine. I am pleased

497
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:59,417
Cloud, you didn't disappoint me

498
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,125
You taught me well

499
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,500
Good!

500
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:07,542
Father!

501
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:12,292
Behave like a lady

502
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:14,792
I heard Cloud had returned

503
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,583
I just wanted to see him

504
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:19,708
Thank you for your concern

505
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:21,542
Who's concerned about you?

506
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,375
I'm concerned about what you owe me

507
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,542
Did you bring them?

508
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:29,000
What does Cloud owe you?

509
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:33,167
Father,
your passion is to collect famous swords

510
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:34,333
I'm a collector, too

511
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,542
I am fond of interesting stones

512
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,667
Cloud owes me 19 colourful stones

513
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,708
Ridiculous!

514
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,542
My Lord! My Lord!

515
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,625
Masters Frost and Wind have returned

516
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:55,542
Where are they?

517
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:58,375
They are outside, and dare not enter

518
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:09,958
Get up!

519
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,250
You lost Mud Buddha due to inexperience

520
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,833
Thank you, Master
Thank you, Master

521
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,458
But Cloud succeeded,

522
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,375
and brought back the Unchallenged Sword

523
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,000
I'm going back to my chambers

524
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:40,000
Striding Cloud's mood is
like a wild horse.. unpredictable

525
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:42,875
Its been ten years,

526
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,708
with Fongs death...

527
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,333
III hear from Sword Saint soon

528
00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:53,792
Well finish our duel from ten years ago

529
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,083
I must intensively train

530
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,167
my Trinity Strength

531
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:01,292
Come here

532
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,292
Before I go into seclusion,

533
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I must settle something

534
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,542
Among my three disciples,
you have the kindest heart

535
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:21,125
Wind, it is my wish that
you marry my daughter

536
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,458
I will arrange for a date

537
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:29,250
Charity, don't you like Wind?

538
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,208
Don't ask me

539
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Look after her

540
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,000
Master, lets discuss marriage later

541
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:50,250
Your father and I had betrothed you
to each other

542
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,167
I didn't tell you earlier

543
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,833
because it wasn't the right time

544
00:54:56,667 --> 00:55:00,958
You and Charity have grown up together

545
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:03,000
What a perfect match

546
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:04,875
If you do not consent

547
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:09,083
I will be greatly disappointed

548
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,792
Congratulations, Wind

549
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:24,833
Skinny, Girlie, let me tell you...

550
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,625
Well, I do like Wind...

551
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,500
but I also like Cloud

552
00:55:57,458 --> 00:56:00,000
Charity, its me, Wind

553
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,000
Wi n d

554
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:10,500
I want to talk to you

555
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,292
Come in

556
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,708
This is not Sword Grave
You won't be punished

557
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23,125
I will be brief

558
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,208
Go ahead

559
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:28,583
I remember when Master brought me here,

560
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:30,917
you were the first to offer me some tea

561
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I felt very warm

562
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,833
Father said if he hadn't rescued you,

563
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,792
you would've been eaten by wolves

564
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I remember

565
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,542
So when he mentioned about
marriage today,

566
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,375
I was very happy

567
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:53,375
But I know love must
come from both sides

568
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:56,792
I don't know
whether this is Master's wish.

569
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:59,250
Or if it is your own wish?

570
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:09,000
But if this is not what you want,
I won't force you

571
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,000
Does Charity know about this?

572
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:50,792
I'm the one to decide
She has to accept it

573
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:54,625
Your eyes,

574
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:57,750
they're the same as
when I took you in ten years ago

575
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:03,750
If you're unhappy about this

576
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:07,042
you may be excused from attending
the wedding banquet

577
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:19,667
Doctor Yu

578
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,458
You're the most respected person
in our village,

579
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,292
You must help us

580
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:32,625
You heal us when we are ill

581
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:37,667
You mediate our fights for us

582
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:41,000
We respect you the most

583
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:46,417
We have had bad harvests.
and Conquers Clan taxes are high

584
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,000
We can barely survive

585
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:53,083
Please help us

586
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:58,292
I will go and speak with Conquer and

587
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,750
explain your hardship

588
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,917
Thank you, Doctor Yu

589
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,458
Thank you
Please get up...

590
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,000
Go home

591
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,208
Muse and I will go within these few days

592
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Let's go home

593
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,792
Muse

594
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,792
Father, your arm is burning again

595
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:37,375
It does not seem to belong to me,

596
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,833
sometimes it hurts so much

597
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,792
They say I can heal all diseases

598
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,000
But I cannot heal myself

599
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:58,000
Father,
are we really going to Conquer's Clan?

600
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:02,000
Wonderful! I can go see the world

601
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:05,292
I can learn to mingle, and explore

602
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,250
What did you say?

603
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,958
Just babbling

604
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,167
Welcome!

605
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,667
Master Frost! Master Frost!

606
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,500
Here, try it on

607
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,292
Jester, what are you doing?

608
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,667
The groom will have to tie this on

609
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:34,958
Do me a favor, see how it looks

610
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:40,000
You look pale and sick

611
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,250
Not as pale as you!

612
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,458
Charity is getting married
Are you depressed?

613
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,708
No. Who said so?

614
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,875
I watched you all grow up

615
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I can see through everything

616
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:55,250
If you love someone,
you only wish her to be happy

617
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,667
Wind has a kind heart

618
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,250
It is good that Charity is marrying him

619
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,417
Congratulations!

620
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,500
Such a tremendous event

621
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,333
I wouldn't miss it for the world

622
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,917
It's the groom! Congratulations!

623
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,833
I hear your fiancee is pretty as a flower

624
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm not the groom

625
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,542
lam...

626
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:22,458
I'm Frost of Conquer's Clan

627
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,833
Welcome, on behalf of my Master

628
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:30,042
So you're the famous Frost

629
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,792
Lord Conquer has three disciples

630
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,875
Fists, Palms, Kicks

631
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,333
Each has a speciality
Too bad they don't use swords

632
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,792
You are so crazy about swords

633
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,995
You must be the one known as Seedy Sword

634
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That's right!

635
01:01:57,917 --> 01:02:00,042
Father, look over there

636
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:04,792
I am Doctor Yu from the Lake region,

637
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,333
representing 320 villages of 16 towns

638
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,125
I seek a meeting with Lord Conquer

639
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:09,583
Your invitation?

640
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,375
Is there a celebration?

641
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:14,042
Oh, good!

642
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:16,375
I have never been to a banquet!

643
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:19,125
Please tell me.
is it a birthday, marriage,

644
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,542
or a birth?

645
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,000
Muse

646
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,917
Therere so many people anyway

647
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,250
One more
or one less wouldn't even matter

648
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:29,000
Please let us go in to take a look

649
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,458
What is it?

650
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:33,250
Jester
I am DoctorYu...

651
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,750
Mr. White Face, can you let us in?

652
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:38,583
What a smell! It stinks!

653
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:40,292
Its the scent of a woman

654
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,000
Women?

655
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:43,958
We pick herbal medicines
in the mountains

656
01:02:44,042 --> 01:02:45,417
These are the smells of herbs

657
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,625
You pick medicinal herbs?

658
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,875
Then you must be Heal-all Doctor Yu
with the Fire Beast Arm?

659
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,667
That's right

660
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,208
I thank you on behalf of Lord Conquer

661
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:57,000
Come in, well talk after the banquet

662
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:01,458
Look after yourself

663
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,833
Leave us

664
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,250
Yes, my Lord

665
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Father

666
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:25,000
It's your wedding day today
It makes me miss your mother

667
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,958
You look a lot like her

668
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:32,792
Do I really?

669
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:39,000
She died giving birth to you

670
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:45,333
All these years,
though I've had other women,

671
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,417
the one I love the most...

672
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,042
is your mother

673
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,125
I always thought
you had a heart of stone

674
01:04:04,292 --> 01:04:05,125
Charity...

675
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,917
Do you knowwhat Iwish?

676
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,667
Not for the best martial art

677
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,500
Not to be ruler of the world

678
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,500
But to see...

679
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,125
my daughter live a happy life

680
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:31,000
I wish you to marry well

681
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,125
Father

682
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,875
Conquer! Come out, you old bastard!

683
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,708
I seek revenge on behalf of
the Unchallenged City!

684
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:10,125
Ming! You think
you can upturn Conquer's Clan?

685
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:12,917
You are too naive

686
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,083
Conquers Clan destroyed my family

687
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:16,917
My father was murdered
Unchallenged Sword was stolen

688
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,333
Even if I, Ming, cannot get revenge

689
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,417
I must have Conquer explain
his evil deeds

690
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:26,125
Give me Unchallenged City,
give me my Unchallenged Sword!

691
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,417
What's your business with them?

692
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,000
Monks should be charitable and kind

693
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,958
So I promised Young Master...

694
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:35,125
to help investigate
the murder of his family

695
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,917
I hope you will help,
in the name of Buddha

696
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,250
Today is my daughters wedding

697
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,292
I won't

698
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,125
let any conflict interrupt
tonight's celebration

699
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:06,125
Conquers Clan may not be
as influential as Shaolin

700
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,667
But we are the leaders of all

701
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:12,708
the other clans

702
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,208
Excuse my directness

703
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,333
Support me and prosper
Or oppose me and die!

704
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:24,500
Buddha have pity

705
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:29,167
You have explained your position clearly

706
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,250
Young Master, what do you think?

707
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:40,042
My skills are not strong enough,

708
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,583
I cannot even defeat Wind

709
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,125
I am certainly no match for Conquer,

710
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,542
I came to deliver this for my uncle,
Sword Saint

711
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:09,125
"Our battle should take place
on the autumn solstice

712
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:12,458
This will settle
our ten-years-old appointment"

713
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,042
I've waited for this for a long time

714
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:24,583
Everything's fine now!

715
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:27,792
A toast, everyone! Music!

716
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,542
I wish I were the bride

717
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,417
You're such a tomboy
Who will ever marry you?

718
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,625
Wind is one of the favorite disciples
of my Lord

719
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:13,750
and he will be his son-in-law

720
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:16,833
So after the ceremony,
he will be twice as close!

721
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,708
Wind, promise me,
you must treat Charity well

722
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:23,000
U nderstand?

723
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:25,083
I will obey your wishes

724
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,542
Let's bow to the ancestors. Kneel...

725
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:28,875
Hold it!

726
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,125
Cloud

727
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:45,542
Cloud

728
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:46,833
Come with me

729
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,083
Striding Cloud, how dare you!

730
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:15,750
I thought you would never come!

731
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,125
Why did you agree to marry Wind?

732
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,500
You never asked why

733
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,208
I cannot let another man touch you!

734
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,583
I can marry him
and still keep seeing you

735
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,083
Charity

736
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,375
Come back!

737
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,917
I have obeyed you for 10 years

738
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:39,125
I'm leaving Conquer's Clan
and taking Charity with me

739
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:45,500
If you're a man,
go and fight for your wife

740
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:48,333
Don't let the world laugh at you

741
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:52,042
Fight for your reputation!

742
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,000
Cloud

743
01:10:27,042 --> 01:10:28,750
Master!
Shut up!

744
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,125
Father!

745
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,417
Look out!

746
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,167
Charity!

747
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:23,125
She is already my woman. Go away!

748
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,875
Charity, is it true?

749
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,875
I'm sorry, Wind

750
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,125
Why did you agree to marry me then?

751
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:41,667
Have you ever loved me?

752
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:45,125
Yes

753
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,083
It's all right if you don't love me

754
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:58,125
Love doesn't call for an explanation

755
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,167
You'll always be mine

756
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:22,292
Charity, I love you

757
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:30,625
III always be with you

758
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:38,250
Charity...

759
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,125
Master!

760
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:52,125
I killed my own daughter...

761
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:47,208
Thanks to the ancestors
Phoenix is finally pregnant

762
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:50,333
The Lui family line will
have continuation,

763
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:54,792
and the Xias family will continue
for generations and prosper!

764
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,958
Father-in-law, bless us

765
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:03,000
I will take good care of
your descendants

766
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:09,208
Lai

767
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:13,167
You guard this shrine well

768
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:16,125
Even though he is preserved by Ice Vigor

769
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:20,750
You must still protect
my late fathers body

770
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:21,667
Yes, sir

771
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:27,125
Sit down, Phoenix

772
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:39,500
Who is it?

773
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:43,500
Striding Cloud wishes to borrow
your Ice Vigor

774
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:45,417
What?

775
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,375
It is the heirloom treasure of our family,

776
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:50,125
how dare you take it?

777
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,125
I will accert any condition

778
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,583
only if you agree to lend it to me

779
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:05,958
Cloud, Ice Vigor is buried with
my late father to preserve his body

780
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:09,583
I am very moved that you would risk

781
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,500
so much for a loved one

782
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:14,792
But have you thought about

783
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,375
my position

784
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,667
if you took it away?

785
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:24,500
That is your problem, not mine

786
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:26,125
Sorry, I cannot oblige

787
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,875
See our guest out!

788
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,125
Phoenix!

789
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:02,875
Dragon!

790
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:04,125
Phoenix, are you okay?

791
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,750
I came for the Ice Vigor
I do not wish to hurt you

792
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:27,125
Halt!

793
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,125
You may not enter!

794
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,125
Leave if you wish to live!

795
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:08,292
Striding Cloud,
return Charity's body to me

796
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:10,917
No one can take her away

797
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:13,500
With your powers?

798
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,125
I did not teach you
the last move of Cloud Palms

799
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,333
I will show you today
so you will die in peace

800
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:50,500
Cloud Palms will only work with liquid,

801
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:53,542
and here we are in the desert now

802
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:58,125
I followed you here
before I confronted you

803
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:10,000
Lets see how much blood you have

804
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:15,583
I will use it to enrich
my Trinity Strength

805
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,125
Charity, wait for me!

806
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,333
Father, look! Someone has fainted!

807
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:17,792
It's Striding Cloud who stole the bride!

808
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:29,750
Striding Cloud...

809
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,708
Give me back my daughter!

810
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:40,958
I must avenge for Father?

811
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:49,833
You must love that girl alot

812
01:24:50,292 --> 01:24:54,750
You're so romantic
You can even love in your dreams

813
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,750
Charity...

814
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:23,750
Muse, what are you doing?

815
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:27,583
Nothing. He is still sweating
I'll get some medicine

816
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,833
I've been asking around

817
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,500
After Conquer killed his own daughter

818
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:41,708
Striding Cloud took the body
and got into a lot of trouble

819
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,917
Conquer did all this to him
at the royal mausoleum

820
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:47,417
There is so much hatred

821
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:49,500
between Master and pupil

822
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:51,750
How sad!

823
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:55,375
He lost his lover
and his arm all in one day

824
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:58,458
Father, will he die?

825
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:03,083
So you must be very careful
when picking a husband

826
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:04,667
Who says I want to get married?

827
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:06,167
You do. Its written all over your face

828
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,708
You taught me yourself

829
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:11,917
As herbal doctors.

830
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,292
it is our mission to save
and help those who need us

831
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:15,125
No matter good or bad,

832
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:17,750
a life is a life, right?

833
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:21,625
Father! What's wrong with you?

834
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,333
Father...

835
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:30,417
Are you all right?
I won't think of marriage any more...

836
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:31,583
This arm

837
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:33,958
Ever since I succeeded training
this Fire Beast Arm,

838
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:36,333
it has been rejecting my body,

839
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,833
as though it doesn't belong to me
I can't control it

840
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,708
Muse, tell my assistants to get ready

841
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:45,917
for an operation

842
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:46,958
Hurry!

843
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,500
Since Striding Clouds arrival,

844
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,083
I've had a feeling that

845
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,958
this arm has found its real master

846
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:06,458
I am going to give him my Fire Beast Arm

847
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:12,250
Striding Cloud, think of it this way

848
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:16,625
We are repaying a debt
from a previous life

849
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:02,958
Good medicine always tastes bitter
Its good for you

850
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,500
You are...

851
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:09,750
I am Muse

852
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:12,625
You have fainted for four days

853
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:17,083
If my father had not rescued you,
you would have died

854
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:25,333
My arm...Why?

855
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,167
Like it? I put it on for you

856
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:30,333
You've wakened

857
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,750
It was my arm
Take it as a present from me

858
01:28:38,792 --> 01:28:40,667
We've met before, during the wedding...

859
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,750
Muse

860
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:46,875
Fire Beast Arm finally found
its rightful owner

861
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,542
Thank you

862
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,750
Don't mention it

863
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,750
Striding Cloud,
your arm is still in recovery

864
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:54,458
It needs plenty of rest

865
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,625
Muse, let's go.. .give him some peace

866
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,125
I'm feeding him his medicine

867
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,750
He has his arms now
He can do it himself

868
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:30,542
Wind

869
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:34,542
For two months
you've done nothing but drink and sleep

870
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,542
If you go on like this,
you will be wasted!

871
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,708
I'm wasted anyway

872
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,542
Go with Hawk and Bat

873
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,250
Bring me the Blood Bodhi fruit

874
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:51,292
It is in Cirrus Cave
where your father was killed

875
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:53,750
Behave if you know what's good for you
This is an order

876
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:10,250
Cloud...

877
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,750
Cloud...

878
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:19,333
Cloud...

879
01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:19,750
Cloud

880
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:24,750
Cloud, meal time

881
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,750
You still miss her?

882
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:40,333
Let me tell you

883
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,917
When I saw your lover at Conquers Clan

884
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:44,792
wearing that beautiful bridal gown,

885
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,083
I was so envious

886
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:53,750
They call you Muse
because you are easily amused?

887
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:55,500
Certainly not!

888
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,583
I was blessed

889
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:00,250
by a Muse at birth

890
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,417
Simple as that

891
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:06,083
Thank you both

892
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:06,958
for rescuing me

893
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,375
Don't mention it

894
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:13,417
Will you be returning to Conquer's Clan?

895
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:15,583
I must

896
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:18,208
To seek revenge

897
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:21,875
Revenge back and forth with no end
When will all this vengeance end?

898
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:26,750
In this world some people...

899
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:31,250
have no friends and no love

900
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:34,333
I am such a person

901
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:35,750
Father. I like
the feeling of being carried by you

902
01:34:00,667 --> 01:34:02,375
Mother!

903
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:16,083
Master Wind

904
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,667
Have some water

905
01:34:20,042 --> 01:34:21,000
Come

906
01:34:58,708 --> 01:35:00,500
What is that on the cliff?

907
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,458
Blood Bodhi fruit!
They must be Blood Bodhi fruit!

908
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:35,750
His Lordship once said
just one will increase your powers

909
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:59,500
Go away!

910
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:09,417
Come out! Beast! Come out...

911
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,167
Stop shouting

912
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:13,167
If you keep shouting
the beast may come out

913
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:27,750
Master Wind, please don't blame us

914
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:30,875
That day,
all 296 people at Unchallenged City

915
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:32,083
took this poison

916
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:34,167
Its colourless. scentless.
flesh-rotting and bone-eating

917
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:35,792
They died in the hands of Master Cloud

918
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,750
Why are you doing this?

919
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,958
Lord Conquer ordered it, so we must obey

920
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:43,750
Senseless, its senseless...

921
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,917
It will be

922
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:46,292
a great achievement for us

923
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:47,375
If we bring back your head
and the fruits, we'll be rewarded

924
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,917
I'll give you back the fruits

925
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,750
Then we'll call it even. Deal?

926
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:45,583
‘With a heart as clear as ice,
the sky may fall and I will not fear"

927
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:49,000
Who is it?

928
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,750
Its me, Jester

929
01:41:52,375 --> 01:41:55,958
Congratulations my Lord,

930
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:59,667
you have achieved amazing powers!
World-dominating powers!

931
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,750
What are you saying?

932
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,875
This Sword Saint, such arrogance
To challenge my Lord

933
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:11,375
He doesn't know you have achieved
this amazing power

934
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:13,750
Really, you're fulfilling destiny

935
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,745
Fulfilling destiny?

936
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:24,250
Yes, fulfilling destiny. Oops

937
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,500
Jester

938
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:34,625
You sweet-talker, that is nonsense!

939
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:39,875
No. I dare not
Every word I say comes from my heart

940
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:45,958
Go out

941
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:47,917
Yes

942
01:43:00,292 --> 01:43:01,208
Yes, Master

943
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:10,750
You are the only one
I don't have to worry about

944
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:15,167
Now that Wind and Cloud have
both disappeared and

945
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:21,292
I must go to battle tomorrow,

946
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:25,958
I command you to take leadership of
the three halls, and help me rule the world

947
01:43:28,667 --> 01:43:30,417
I only worry about by inability

948
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:52,625
I have full confidence in you

949
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:58,042
Frost, it is my life's ambition to
beat Sword Saint

950
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,792
Soon,
the leadership of Conquer's Clan...

951
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,000
will be yours

952
01:44:05,333 --> 01:44:06,167
Thank you, Master

953
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:17,500
In the face of battle.
to preserve our interests...

954
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,458
Conquers Clan cannot afford
any mistakes

955
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:26,708
Whoever is disloyal to me must die

956
01:44:26,958 --> 01:44:28,750
Terminate Jester! He's a nuisance!

957
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:54,125
Have you seen Jester?

958
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:56,292
No, no

959
01:44:58,208 --> 01:44:59,042
Stop!

960
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,375
Please don't kill me...

961
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:04,125
Lord Conquer is a true villain

962
01:45:04,542 --> 01:45:05,917
He is playing tricks on us all

963
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:06,875
Rubbish!

964
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:09,500
You betrayed Master. You must die!

965
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:12,125
He tricked Wind and Cloud
and killed their parents

966
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:14,417
I'll bring you to a person,
then you'll understand

967
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:17,333
It is Mud Buddha.
Lord Conquer has imprisoned him

968
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:25,333
Jester, you look ridiculous...

969
01:45:27,292 --> 01:45:28,542
in those clothes

970
01:45:30,083 --> 01:45:32,750
Let me get change first,
and I'll take you to Mud Buddha

971
01:45:58,292 --> 01:46:03,333
Master Frost...

972
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:06,167
So the man who kidnapped him
the other day was Master

973
01:47:06,875 --> 01:47:11,458
I must fight. I must persist...

974
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:18,458
I must not die now

975
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:14,042
Conquer killed your parents

976
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:17,875
I purposely gave him

977
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,875
yours and Cloud's birth chart

978
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:25,042
so he would let you live

979
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:29,208
Destiny...

980
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:36,958
All things go in cycles
Cause, consequences...

981
01:48:37,583 --> 01:48:40,875
Everything will have its final judgement

982
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:45,625
What shall I do?

983
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:52,875
The Dragon is powerful,

984
01:48:53,917 --> 01:48:59,125
but will be stranded
when wind and cloud become a storm

985
01:49:04,875 --> 01:49:06,583
Sword Saint has come for the duel

986
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
A long-awaited occassion!

987
01:49:21,167 --> 01:49:24,917
Although I now rule
the martial arts world,

988
01:49:26,292 --> 01:49:29,333
not being able to fight you is
like having a bone stuck in my throat

989
01:49:30,542 --> 01:49:33,000
I must get it out to ease my discomfort

990
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:38,583
I am glad you have preserved
your strength. You still look strong

991
01:49:39,542 --> 01:49:42,875
If I can defeat you today

992
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:46,375
I will have no regrets

993
01:49:47,292 --> 01:49:49,500
I accept your challenge with
my Unchallenged Sword

994
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:55,042
And I will have...

995
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,417
Defeated your entire family

996
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,542
Wait here

997
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:31,417
Is he human? Why is he not moving?

998
01:51:33,125 --> 01:51:34,417
Don't

999
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:23,208
Stay here. I'm going in

1000
01:52:31,292 --> 01:52:32,833
Uncle!

1001
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:35,875
Conquer, III die with you!

1002
01:52:55,875 --> 01:52:57,375
I am so useless...

1003
01:53:01,458 --> 01:53:04,917
Help me seek revenge

1004
01:53:29,875 --> 01:53:32,667
Mud Buddha said.
Wind and Cloud must be together

1005
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:33,875
Or it wont be a storm

1006
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:35,125
Cloud!

1007
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:42,208
Blood Bodhi fruit can increase your powers

1008
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:15,708
Frost. announce to the world.

1009
01:54:15,875 --> 01:54:18,083
I have defeated Sword Saint,
my ultimate opponent

1010
01:54:18,417 --> 01:54:20,458
I am now truly invincible

1011
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,458
You killed the parents of Wind and Cloud

1012
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:29,375
You ordered Hawk and Bat to kill Wind.

1013
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:31,583
right?

1014
01:54:33,292 --> 01:54:36,708
So you didn't kill Jester?

1015
01:54:37,542 --> 01:54:40,250
Conquer, you cold-blooded murderer!

1016
01:54:43,458 --> 01:54:45,875
I was right

1017
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:50,292
Of the three, you are most naive

1018
01:54:53,875 --> 01:54:55,667
I refuse to be your successor

1019
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,458
You're only using me!

1020
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:04,542
Correct. Let it be known to all

1021
01:55:06,083 --> 01:55:10,625
Better that they owe me, than I owe them,

1022
01:55:11,375 --> 01:55:13,083
including you

1023
01:55:18,167 --> 01:55:19,750
Frost, where are you going?

1024
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:23,542
I'm leaving Conquer's Clan

1025
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:33,208
You think you can come
and go as you please?

1026
01:55:46,417 --> 01:55:47,458
Frost

1027
01:55:53,042 --> 01:55:55,875
So you two are still alive

1028
01:55:56,583 --> 01:55:57,750
Conquer

1029
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:02,500
Sword Saints martial arts is
truly powerful

1030
01:56:02,875 --> 01:56:04,870
But nothing

1031
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:06,333
compared to my Trinity Strength

1032
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,333
Ten years ago, I asked you

1033
01:56:09,917 --> 01:56:11,667
Aren't you afraid I'll avenge my father?

1034
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:15,958
If I can take you in,

1035
01:56:16,292 --> 01:56:19,375
I have planned for such a day

1036
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Master Wind

1037
01:56:57,333 --> 01:57:01,417
Do not use all your force,
do not say all you think

1038
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:04,875
If you go too far,
destiny will prematurely end

1039
01:58:19,042 --> 01:58:21,875
I taught you
all the martial arts you ever knew

1040
01:58:22,542 --> 01:58:25,250
Remember, I am your Master

1041
01:59:04,708 --> 01:59:07,958
Cloud is unpredictable, Wind is formless

1042
01:59:09,042 --> 01:59:12,125
You think you two can defeat me?

1043
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:13,667
Let me tell you

1044
01:59:14,875 --> 01:59:16,333
This is Sword Grave.

1045
01:59:16,875 --> 01:59:19,250
besides swords

1046
01:59:19,875 --> 01:59:21,917
it will also be your burial ground

1047
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:24,875
Prepare to die!

1048
02:00:01,917 --> 02:00:03,875
I taught you Fists, Palms and Kicks,

1049
02:00:04,042 --> 02:00:07,708
but I ultimate weapon is the sword!

1050
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,792
The Dragon is powerful,

1051
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:26,625
but will be stranded
when wind and cloud become a storm"

1052
02:00:31,708 --> 02:00:34,708
Mud Buddha.
I don't believe in your predictions

1053
02:00:35,292 --> 02:00:37,875
I only believe in myself

1054
02:01:14,083 --> 02:01:15,500
I have hidden the sword

1055
02:01:15,667 --> 02:01:16,500
Even if you find it,

1056
02:01:16,833 --> 02:01:18,750
you cannot use it without my blood
or that of my son's

1057
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:43,958
Charity...

1058
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:45,250
Charity

1059
02:03:45,417 --> 02:03:46,875
Father. . . Sorry

1060
02:03:48,167 --> 02:03:48,792
Charity

1061
02:03:48,958 --> 02:03:52,500
Father, help me...

1062
02:04:32,875 --> 02:04:33,875
Cloud!

1063
02:04:35,167 --> 02:04:36,708
What are you doing?

1064
02:04:38,083 --> 02:04:39,833
Get out of my way

1065
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,875
After all, he raised us

1066
02:04:42,792 --> 02:04:48,000
Sword Saint, Whispering Prince
Where are you? Help me

1067
02:04:50,583 --> 02:04:53,917
I am Conqueror of the World!

1068
02:05:00,583 --> 02:05:01,875
It is said If you go too far...

1069
02:05:05,375 --> 02:05:07,167
Destiny will prematurely end"

1070
02:05:12,458 --> 02:05:14,875
I am Conqueror of the World

1071
02:05:18,542 --> 02:05:21,667
I am Conqueror of the World...

1072
02:05:31,875 --> 02:05:34,042
I am Conqueror of the World...
