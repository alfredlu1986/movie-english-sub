1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,901
Oh, thank you, Arnold.
I can manage that.

2
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:25,907
But I still don't see why you couldn't
wait a couple of weeks.

3
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:27,966
Why go all the way up to Loki?

4
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:32,344
To hear Grace Makanga speak,
and she won't be coming to Nairobi.

5
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,474
I see.

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,542
Oh, sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,215
Okay, well—

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,622
Is too hot to be standing around.
If you're sure.

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,619
Bye.
Bye, Arnold.

10
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:53,034
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.

11
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:55,093
Bye, sweetheart.

12
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:57,503
See you in, uh— in a couple of days.

13
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,096
Sandy, he's here.

14
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,661
Hi. Come in. Oh, hi, Sandy.
You caught me skiving, I'm afraid.

15
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,132
How's Gloria? Well?
Gloria's fine.

16
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:09,194
You haven't heard from Tessa,
I suppose?

17
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:12,763
No, she's, uh, up north
with, um, Arnold Bluhm.

18
00:03:14,643 --> 00:03:17,237
Look, old chap, do you think you could
stop doing that a moment?

19
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,739
Something wrong?

20
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:23,444
She didn't say anything
about returning by road?

21
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,453
From Loki?

22
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:29,787
Well, that wouldn't surprise me,
knowing Tessa. I mean, I hope not.
Dangerous country.

23
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,793
What is it, Sandy?

24
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:36,298
We're getting reports
of a white woman, black driver,

25
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:43,396
Found early this morning,
southern end of Lake Turkana,

26
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:46,464
Dead—killed, it seems.

27
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:53,078
You think it might be Tessa?

28
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:57,415
Seems they hired a car and driver
in Loki and then headed east.

29
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:01,113
They spent the night at Lodwar.

30
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,086
They shared a room, Justin.

31
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,830
The dead black isn't Arnold Bluhm.

32
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:17,563
Most terribly sorry.

33
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:25,904
And how sure are you?

34
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,242
Is not looking good.

35
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,500
Is...

36
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:47,729
Good of you to tell me, Sandy.

37
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,430
Can't have been easy.

38
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:08,848
Diplomacy, therefore,
as we've demonstrated,

39
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:14,055
Is the very map and marker
of civilization,

40
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,725
Pointing nations the safest way
through country...

41
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,769
Fraught with peril.

42
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:22,770
And thas it.

43
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:28,276
Uh, Sir Bernard Pellegrin has asked me
to convey his, uh, regrets...

44
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:31,575
That he's been unable to deliver
his lecture in person.

45
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:34,639
And I thank you on my own behalf
for your very kind attention.

46
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,117
Thank you.

47
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,116
Excuse me. Excuse me.

48
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,454
Yeah? Yeah, sorry.
Excu— Excuse me.

49
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:48,155
Sir, I've just got one question.
I just wondered whose map,
um, is Britain using...

50
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,166
When it completely ignores the United Nations
and decides to invade Iraq?

51
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,794
Or do you— do you think...

52
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,274
Is more diplomatic to bend
to the will of a superpower...

53
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:04,779
And—and politely take part
in Vietnam, the sequel?

54
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:12,449
Well, uh, l— I can't speak
for Sir Bernard—

55
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:15,422
Oh, I thought thas
why you were here.

56
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:18,949
I mean, diplomats have
to go where they're sent.

57
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,087
So do Labradors.
Ooh.

58
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:23,495
Ouch.

59
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,965
Well, I think that, no, Sir Bernard
would no doubt argue...

60
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:30,870
That when, um, peaceful means
are exhausted, then—
Exhausted?

61
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,875
Mr. Quayle, they're not exactly
exhausted, are they?

62
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:38,209
I mean, they're just— they're just—
No, they are just lying
in the way of the tanks.

63
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,716
No, l-l-les face it.
We've taken 60 years...

64
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:46,517
To build up this international organization
called the United Nations,

65
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:48,579
Which is meant to avoid wars,

66
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:52,957
- and now we just blow it up
because our car's running out of petrol.
- Sit down, Tessa, for Chriss sake.

67
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,155
- L— I think—
- Hold on a minute.
Les see what he says.

68
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,324
I think the questioner
is making a valid point,
and that a nation's foreign policy...

69
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,665
- should not be determined
by narrow commercial interests.
- Thas bullshit.

70
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,898
Thas bullshit.
You have to take responsibility.

71
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:09,172
You are being paid to apologize
for this pathetic country of Britain,

72
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:12,577
And he can explain to us why we've burned
our diplomatic credentials...

73
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:16,584
And why we're killing, you know,
thousands of innocent people...

74
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:19,416
Just for—just for some barrels of oil...

75
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,683
And a photo opportunity
on the White House lawn.

76
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,748
Why?

77
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,546
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks.

78
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:59,220
You were courageous.
No. No, I was completely rude.

79
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:04,095
- It was just bad behavior, and l—
- You were impassioned.

80
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,327
I'm so embarrassed. Sorry.

81
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,563
Please don't be embarrassed.
I'm really sorry.

82
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:18,913
And, uh, thanks very much.
You... tried to protect me.

83
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:22,576
Very feebly.
No, you were—you were—
You weren't feeble. I just—

84
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:24,710
Anyway, it was a very dull lecture.

85
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,755
It was a dull lecture,
but even so I shouldn't have—

86
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:29,916
Well, look, can l—
can I buy you a coffee or—

87
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,654
I owe you a drink. Come on.
All right.
You can buy me a drink.

88
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,492
I'm Justin, by the way.
Tessa. How do you do?

89
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:37,555
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah, yeah.
Pleased to meet you.

90
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,625
- You were quite scary,
but I don't blame you.

91
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:42,693
It was absolute bollocks,

92
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,501
So you're quite right to challenge—

93
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:48,907
I'm rather nervous,
I have to confess.

94
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:51,343
Me too. This way.

95
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:54,007
Oh, do come in.

96
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,517
Yeah, please. Of course.

97
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:59,520
Thank you.
You lead the way.

98
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:01,522
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.
All right.

99
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,425
Wriggle.

100
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:32,315
There we go.

101
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:40,720
Thank you.

102
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:45,165
For... this wonderful gift.

103
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,395
How very generous of me.

104
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:51,095
No, l—

105
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,039
You—You're so—

106
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:04,013
You know what I mean.
I know what you mean.

107
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:07,419
I feel safe with you.

108
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,515
I can imagine when you were six.

109
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,583
You leading the revolution.

110
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,027
No. No, I was very conventional.

111
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,031
Here, Justin, put this on.

112
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,570
Mr. Quayle? Please.

113
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,788
Please.

114
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,649
Know this lady, sir?

115
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:24,627
Yes, I do. Is, uh—

116
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,100
Is my wife, Tessa.

117
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:40,238
Sandy.

118
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:47,354
Come on.

119
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:26,050
Tessa.

120
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,961
My God, what a surprise.

121
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,928
How'd you get in?

122
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,993
Take me to Africa with you.

123
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,006
What? Roll you up in a rug?

124
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,065
Pack you in a tea chest?
Very funny.

125
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,078
I'd have to smuggle you in
as illicit goods.

126
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,637
I couldn't declare you.

127
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,548
Oh, listen. I could put you
in one of these plant boxes, and—

128
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:53,884
You'd be very comfortable
wrapped up in a little piece of, uh—

129
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,219
I could label you. "Tessa."

130
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:59,650
I'm serious.

131
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,264
Um, yeah, I can see you are.

132
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:15,038
And in what—what capacity
should I take you to Africa?

133
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,241
I don't mind. You can take me
as your mistress, lover, wife.

134
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,977
There's too much choice.

135
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,446
L—Well, I'm—

136
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:32,057
I'm flattered
that you would like—
No. No.

137
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:36,063
Justin, please don't
say that sentence.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

138
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,429
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thas really—

139
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,025
Just yes or no?

140
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,129
Well, we—we hardly know
one another. I mean—

141
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,071
You can learn me.

142
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:48,735
Learn you?
Mmm.

143
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:57,046
Yes or no?

144
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,280
Then l—

145
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,613
Oh.
A gift.

146
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:12,159
Oh, thank you.

147
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,821
Thank you.

148
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,328
Thank you so much.
Is beautiful.

149
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,234
- Hey.
- Arnold.

150
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:27,537
Thas so nice.

151
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:29,873
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,675
They made it for me.

153
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,614
Hey, Mr. Bluhm!

154
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,185
Careful.

155
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,991
Ooh. Take my hand.

156
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,729
What did you give her, Arnold?

157
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:31,067
Nevirapine. The government clinic
didn't have any again.

158
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,198
Jomo.
Yes, Mama Tessa?

159
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:35,869
Have you had your test yet?

160
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,935
No.
Jomo.

161
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:40,573
If she's H. I. V. Positive,
chances are you are too.

162
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,583
Look, Dr. Bluhm, I really must go.

163
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,778
We can talk about this later.
Thank you.
Take you 10 minutes.

164
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:48,619
- Woodrow is very particular about time.
I will be in trouble. Bye.
- I'll see you later.

165
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,256
Jesus!

166
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:01,928
You shouldn't be
wandering around in this heat.

167
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,995
Arnold, stop fussing.
You're as bad as Justin.

168
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,803
If you were my wife,
I'd tie you to the bed.

169
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:10,208
Then what would you do, Doctor?

170
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,269
Thas another story.

171
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,975
Tell me what you'd do.
Hey!

172
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,669
All right.

173
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:00,626
Now, for the first time,

174
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,528
We are exploring a new territory.

175
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:07,056
This is a new discovery...

176
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:09,933
For the famous marine biologist—

177
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,996
Jacques Cousteau.

178
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,473
You are a voyeur.

179
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,409
Is fantastic.

180
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,640
Now we are going down, down, down.

181
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:21,841
Oh, what do we have here?

182
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,476
Zoom!

183
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,852
Wipe it.
I must keep this new discovery
for posterity...

184
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:32,859
And admire the new person inside.

185
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:35,088
You have to go wipe this.
Go and wipe it.

186
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:38,064
Wipe it right now.
No, I can't wipe it.
I'm completely inept with computers.

187
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:42,535
- I'm gonna keep it.
I'm sorry. I love it.

188
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,937
Will you see who thas from,
darling?
Sure.

189
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:02,921
What is it?
What?

190
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:05,516
The e-mail.

191
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:07,584
Oh, is, um—

192
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:09,926
Is just junk— some ad.

193
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:13,399
- For?
- For the Nairobi Hilton.

194
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,732
Oh, my boobs hurt.

195
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,137
Would you, uh, mind, uh—

196
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:22,199
Weekend package deal.

197
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:25,940
Two nights for the price of one.
Mmm. Two guests
for the price of one.

198
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,642
Sweetheart, would you come
and make yourself useful?

199
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,710
Yeah, I'm coming.

200
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,507
My darling. Sweetheart,
I'd like you to put this up
right in the middle.

201
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:03,415
Right?
Yeah.

202
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,749
So, um—

203
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,947
Right there.
Mm-hmm.

204
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:10,013
What do you think?
I think is gorgeous.

205
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,082
I think is very tangled.
No, no, no.

206
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,151
I meant— I meant
about a weekend at the Hilton.

207
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:16,789
Oh, no. Is a bit flashy
for my taste.
Is it?

208
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:20,801
Mm-hmm.
Oh. I wouldn't know.
L— I've never been there.

209
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,669
Well, I have. I was there the other night
meeting someone with Arnold.

210
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,241
Oh, well, just a thought.

211
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:35,678
Sweetheart.

212
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:42,187
Were you just inviting me away
for a dirty weekend at the Hilton?

213
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,851
Mm-hmm.
Were you?

214
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:46,917
I would love to,

215
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,658
But maybe after... Arturo is born.
Oh, Tessa.

216
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,859
We're not calling him
Arturo, please.

217
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,232
Why not?
No. Not— Not Arturo...

218
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,294
Or Giuseppe—
All right. Then what about...

219
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:01,069
Garth— Daddy's name?
No, no. Come on.

220
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:04,202
No, not Garth
or ditto Che or any—

221
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,771
Che?
I just don't want any of these
mad, eccentric, hippieish—

222
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,012
Che?
Alternative—
Yes, your revolutionary half.

223
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:16,182
I think we should call him, in that case,
Che Muffin Quayle.

224
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:18,248
Muffin?
Yes, the Quayle genes.

225
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:21,989
Where do you get Muffin from?
No one's heard of muffins.
High tea by the jolly study fire...

226
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,361
While the starving mob
burns London.

227
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:26,923
Is that— Is that how you see me?
No.

228
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,435
I see you buying the mob
fish and chips...

229
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,495
While you wait
for law and order to return.

230
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:35,905
And I love you the way you are.

231
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,277
What about Arnold?

232
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:45,410
What about Arnold?
As a name.

233
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:48,216
Hmm.
Be such a nice gesture.

234
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,852
Well, perhaps ill be a girl.

235
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:56,726
Mmm. I think is a boy.

236
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,460
I think is a girl.

237
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,196
You'd better get dressed.

238
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:06,199
Move that tray.
Dry these glasses.

239
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:13,610
- Can you open your windows, please?
Please get out of the car.

240
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:32,829
Dr. Joshua Ngaba,
Kenya Health Ministry.

241
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:36,428
Sir Bernard Pellegrin,
head of F. C. O. Africa desk.

242
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:38,734
May I convey Her Majesty's
warmest greetings?

243
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:41,832
I thought that Arnold
was going up-country.

244
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,674
He is. Oh, don't worry.

245
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:47,146
He's not gonna take me.
I've already asked him.
Hmm.

246
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,706
Good. And, Tessa—
Yes?

247
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:52,685
I'd be happier
if you stayed out of Kibera,

248
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,745
At least until
the baby's born anyway.

249
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:58,815
Um, just you wait until
I'm single again.

250
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,562
Hello, Tim. How are you?
Hi.

251
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:08,124
Are you struggling through
without Maude tonight?

252
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:10,864
One of her party headaches.
I take mine standing up.

253
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,930
Oh, how manly of you.
Isn't it just?

254
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:14,941
Hello, Arnold.
Tessa.

255
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,137
Hello, Ghita, darling.
Ooh, what a lovely sari.

256
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:23,206
Interesting guests, Mr. Donohue.

257
00:23:23,284 --> 00:23:27,243
This is Kenya, Dr. Bluhm.
Seems only fair to invite the odd native.

258
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,984
Mmm. The health minister's turn,
was it?

259
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:32,219
So it seems.

260
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,318
Who's that he's talking to?

261
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:37,228
I have no idea.

262
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:40,631
Thought your spies
knew everything, Tim.
Only God knows everything.

263
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:42,897
He works for Mossad.

264
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,064
You've met Dr. Ngaba, have you?

265
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:48,267
Yes, at the opening
of a new state-of-the-art clinic...

266
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,868
Without autoclaves
for sterilizing.
Mmm.

267
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:53,004
Probably converted them
into a Mercedes.

268
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:55,015
Hmm.

269
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,017
I've never met an alchemist before.

270
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,077
Tessa, darling.

271
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:07,856
Ah, Tessa.
Hello, Porter.

272
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:10,898
May I introduce Tessa Quayle,
Dr. Ngaba,

273
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:14,059
The wife of our representative
for aid effectiveness?

274
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,069
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?

275
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:19,664
And this is Dr. Bluhm
from Médecins dans I'univers.
Good evening.

276
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:21,606
Dr. Bluhm and I have met.

277
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:25,339
Yes, it was at the opening for the clinic
that didn't have the sterilizing equipment.

278
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:29,042
We never met, Dr. Ngaba,
but I know your work.

279
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:33,447
Do you know Sir Kenneth Curtiss,
Chief Executive of Three Bees?

280
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:36,718
- Yes, also by reputation.
Good evening.
- Good evening.

281
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:40,227
Company here in Kenya.
We're very proud of him.

282
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:43,058
And which of the bees are you?

283
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,866
You were going to show us
the garden room, Porter.

284
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:50,893
There is just one thing
that I'd like to thank Dr. Ngaba for—

285
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,463
The free nevirapine.

286
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:57,944
He's, uh, persuaded the manufacturers
to donate it to H. I. V. - Positive mothers.

287
00:24:58,012 --> 00:24:59,946
Is a wonderful thing.
Shall we?

288
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:02,744
The problem is,
it isn't actually reaching them.
Some, but not all.

289
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:05,809
So we've been wondering,
is that a standard cock-up, Dr. Ngaba,

290
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:09,152
Or— or were the pills converted
into the limo that you arrived in?

291
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:11,885
I think thas probably enough.
If you'll come through here, Doctor.

292
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,894
Justin.
Excuse me.

293
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:18,796
You've gotta do something about Tessa.
Well, what would you
like me to do, Sandy?

294
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:22,461
Well, she's embarrassing our guests.
Her and that bloody Bluhm.

295
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:25,199
There'll be hell to pay,
I can tell you.

296
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,401
Well, the— the squall
seems to have passed.

297
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:31,070
If you can't control her,
you should keep her locked up.

298
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:33,545
You're wanted on the veranda,
Mr. Woodrow.
Yes.

299
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:48,259
Are so big here, they'll be best
towards the back of the border.

300
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:54,360
Hey, sexy.

301
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:57,268
You look divine.
Sandy, I think you're a pervert.

302
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,171
Stop looking at me like that.
We're to have a baby in a week.

303
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:03,142
Can I come and visit you
in the hospital?

304
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:07,307
You want to visit me in Uhuru?
Uhuru? Tessa, you're not
having it there.

305
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:10,179
Oh, Sandy, come on. Kibera women
have their babies there every day.

306
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:13,015
Is perfectly safe.
No, is not. Is madness.

307
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:15,988
Just— Can I just choose—
Wait a minute. That looks a good one.

308
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,184
Shall we run away?

309
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,160
Yeah, come on then.
Take me for lunch.

310
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,861
I'm fine. Thank you.

311
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:30,062
How are you?
I'm fine. Thank you. How are you?

312
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,402
How are you?

313
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,636
I'm fine. Thank you.
How are you?

314
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,042
I'm fine. How are you?

315
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:45,185
- Look, near the car.
- Jomo is getting a test.

316
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:48,814
Of course. You told him to.
It was a suggestion,
not an order.

317
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:53,485
- What are they carrying
in those little jars?
- Is probably saliva.

318
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:56,394
But thas not how you test
for H. I. V. Here, is it?

319
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:58,625
They're also testing for T. B.
Why?

320
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:02,601
When they test for H. I. V.,
they also test for T. B. Free here.

321
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,730
- What, just for free?
- A small extra service to humanity.

322
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:08,240
They're a drug company,
Arnold. Come on.

323
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,972
No drug company does
something for nothing.

324
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:15,709
Is there... something
you're not telling me—

325
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:18,217
Arnold?

326
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:58,124
Hello, Sandy.

327
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:00,353
I'm so sorry, Tessa.

328
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,387
Gloria sends her sympathies.
What can one say?

329
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:07,491
It was a boy.

330
00:28:07,568 --> 00:28:10,435
- Did Justin already tell you that?
- Tessa. Tessa.

331
00:28:10,504 --> 00:28:12,972
This one was born healthy though.

332
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,942
Weren't you,
my beautiful, beautiful darling?

333
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:21,778
His name is Baraka.
It means blessing.

334
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:24,181
I... don't quite see.

335
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:28,382
Who the mother is?

336
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,516
Her name is Wanza Kilulu.

337
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:35,084
She's 15, and she's dying.

338
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,426
Kioko's 12.

339
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:41,525
He walked 40 kilometers
just to keep the flies off
his sister and her baby.

340
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:44,127
Perhaps thas the blessing.

341
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:47,038
Darling, please don't.

342
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:49,702
Please sit here, Mr. Woodrow.
I'll wait outside.

343
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:52,337
Thank you.

344
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:55,541
Kioko, here you are.

345
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:59,277
You sweetheart.

346
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:03,722
- Justin, my darling, could you please
go and get me a fresh bottle of water?
- Hmm? Sure.

347
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:10,222
Now, Sandy?
Yes?

348
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:13,028
If I tell you something,

349
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,933
Will you listen to me?

350
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,994
Not here, Tessa.

351
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:20,836
No, Sandy,
if I tell you that that—

352
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:24,901
That that girl over there
was being murdered,
would you believe me?

353
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:28,312
Tessa, you're tired.
You're feverish.
No. No, I'm not.

354
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:31,317
Now we haven't got all of the evidence yet,
but when we get it,

355
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:34,718
If I bring it to you, will you—will you
actually do something for once?

356
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:39,658
What you need is rest.
Now what I'm— I'm talking about
are coincidences.

357
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:43,390
Tessa, you've got to stop involving yourself
in matters that don't concern you.

358
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:47,958
You're embarrassing the High Commission,
and you're not doing Justin's career any good.

359
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:51,766
Justin doesn't know what I do.
That doesn't surprise me.

360
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,002
Sandy, you've got to promise me...

361
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:57,977
That you're going to act
on what we tell you.

362
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:00,513
We?
Me and Arnold.

363
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:12,883
Please?
All right. I promise.

364
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:17,856
Within reason.

365
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:21,333
Within reason.

366
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,871
Uh, there's a man.

367
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:33,905
She's raving mad.
You've got to get her to a proper clinic.

368
00:30:33,981 --> 00:30:36,245
With white doctors,
Mr. Woodrow?

369
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:42,212
For Chriss sake, Justin,
she's your wife.
Yes, she's my wife.

370
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,502
You see, she's dead.

371
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,507
What did you give her?
It doesn't matter.

372
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:06,308
Dr. Lorbeer, you have got to stop
testing on patients with H. I. V.

373
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,178
- It— Look at me.
- I have to go.

374
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,595
Justin, stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.
Why? What is it?

375
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:34,597
Tessa.

376
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,410
Is 40 kilometers to Miluri.

377
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,812
Is gonna take them all night.

378
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:44,476
We can't involve ourselves
in their lives, Tessa.

379
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:47,043
Why?

380
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:54,458
Be reasonable.

381
00:31:54,528 --> 00:31:56,894
There are millions of people.
They all need help.

382
00:31:56,964 --> 00:31:59,228
Thas what the agencies
are here for.

383
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,791
Yeah, but these are three people
that we can help.

384
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:03,894
Please.

385
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,399
Justin.

386
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:13,671
I'm sorry, Tessa.
I have to put you first.

387
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:20,045
I have to get you home.

388
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:36,934
Probably got enough
there now, Mustafa.

389
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:39,495
Yeah?
I think.

390
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:42,406
Just the flowers this time, please.

391
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:44,467
You can spare the weeds.

392
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,378
The pest must eat too, bwana.
Yes, I know. If only they would.

393
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,542
They can eat the weeds.
Look, you should be wearing gloves
with that, you know?

394
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:52,609
And there's a mask
if you want it.
Okay.

395
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:57,350
Is an outrageous thing. Is almost as if
is a— is a marriage of convenience—
Shh.

396
00:32:57,424 --> 00:33:00,416
Tessa.
And the only thing is gonna produce
is dead offspring.

397
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:05,297
I'm sorry to interrupt.

398
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:11,363
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

399
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:14,236
I said, what the fuck is that?
Tessa, is pesticide.

400
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:16,572
It— Is just unbelievable.

401
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:19,477
Would you just get that thing
out of this house?

402
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:23,608
Well, if you feel that strongly about it,
yes, Tessa— anything.

403
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:27,951
It would help if you might explain to me
whas upsetting her.

404
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:30,991
I mean, this doesn't kill people, does it?
Unless they swallow it?

405
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:34,323
No.
What? Then can you tell me
why she's so—

406
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,386
You have to trust her, Justin.

407
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:38,954
Is hard, you know,
when she—we don't talk about—

408
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:42,867
- Does she blame me for losing the baby?
- Of course not. Give her time.

409
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,928
Tell her I'll be back later.

410
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,267
Wherever there are drug companies...

411
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,833
Testing their drugs on people
who they think are expendable,

412
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:53,505
You'll find organizations like ours
trying to fight back.

413
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:56,607
Of course, the problem is that they have
millions to spend on P. R...

414
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,983
While we work with volunteers
and a few donated computers.

415
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:03,319
If you're gonna dig deeper,
then most of us have Web sites.

416
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,327
Check out Oxfam, M. S. F.,
Health Action International—

417
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:11,125
Put it in here.

418
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,762
Just mind the roses, please, Mustafa.
Hi, Birgit.

419
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:20,102
Sorry. More questions.
Tessa never sleeps.
Always time for you, Tessa.

420
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,140
Take care of yourself, Tessa, okay?

421
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:33,016
I'm very tired. I'm sorry.
I can't translate that word to you.

422
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,079
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours—

423
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:58,534
Okay. See you, Tessa.

424
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:07,853
Hi.
Hi.

425
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:10,788
Is bloody awful weather.

426
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,383
You really shouldn't have waited up.

427
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,258
Good. Then I think
you should go to bed.

428
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:22,534
I'm safe home now, sweetheart.
No, you're drenched.
Look, take those wet things off.

429
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:25,128
Tessa, come to bed
with me, please.
Yeah, l—

430
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:28,834
I will, but there's, um, something
I have to do first. Is important.

431
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:31,673
Tessa,

432
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:36,310
Whatever it is
that you and Arnold are doing,

433
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:38,715
I'd like it to stop.

434
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:42,620
Wow.
Who have you been talking to?

435
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,148
No one. These are
my concerns, all right?

436
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:50,219
- I'm thinking of your health.
- No. No, you're not.

437
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:52,788
They've asked you to rein me in,
and you're doing it.

438
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,857
Is just unbelievable.

439
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:58,530
What the hell are you talking about?
I hope you know me better than that.

440
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:01,540
Your life is your own.
That was always our agreement.

441
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:04,099
No. No, no. The agreement was...

442
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:06,237
That my work was gonna be my own.

443
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:08,304
Thas what makes me who I am.

444
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:12,318
I mean, if you stop me from doing my work,
then I am nothing. I'm just nobody. L—

445
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,785
I'm not trying to stop you
doing anything.

446
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:19,792
Please.
I'm sorry.

447
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,522
I'm just tired. Thas all.
Very tired.

448
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,587
Then come to bed.

449
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:31,129
Hmm?
Will you get me up for breakfast?

450
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,641
I've got to finish my report.

451
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:46,252
Just smash it like that.
Oh! Right.

452
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,311
Now if you just put those there.

453
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:50,822
You want probably to break them up
into smaller pieces.

454
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:52,882
A bit more vermilion.

455
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,929
Oh, you're just very blasé,
aren't you?

456
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:59,022
You know, just through feel.
No, I wouldn't— No.

457
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,158
I wouldn't call it a parasite, no.

458
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:05,999
You're gonna be late for your match.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

459
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:11,541
Kenny, I can't discuss this on the phone.
Wouldn't even give me an appointment.

460
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:15,605
Time was you buggers couldn't get
your tongues far enough up my arse.
Whas changed?

461
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:18,674
Hi.
If I find out that this has got
anything to do with that bitch—

462
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:22,415
Come to my office.
L— I've got to go, Kenny. Bye.

463
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,582
Having trouble with Three Bees, Sandy?

464
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:28,651
Just Kenny being Kenny.
Oh. Nothing to do
with my report then?

465
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,857
Oh, he's just ranting.

466
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:34,457
Oh, Sandy, you promised me
you were gonna do something.

467
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,526
I sent your report to London.

468
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:38,833
Really?
Yes.

469
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,840
To Pellegrin?
Yes.

470
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:43,001
And?
There was no official response.

471
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:45,806
Well, what was there then?

472
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:48,677
Well, just a personal letter. Thas all.

473
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:50,876
Saying?

474
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:54,352
Is private.
What do you mean,
is private?

475
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:57,549
Thas the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.
I sent him an official document.

476
00:37:57,624 --> 00:38:00,889
I gonna have to call Pellegrin
and ask him.
No, no. Don't do that, Tessa.

477
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:03,088
Why?
Is serious.

478
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:06,997
You know me well enough to know
that I'm not gonna take no
for an answer. Come on.

479
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,602
Tessa,

480
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,662
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.

481
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:15,731
What?
Report where you are,

482
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,174
What you're doing.

483
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:21,407
Trust me, Tessa.

484
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,041
This is something
that you should not pursue.

485
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:31,849
I say that as a friend
who cares deeply for you.

486
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:35,190
Sandy?
Oh, Tessa.
Hi, Gloria.

487
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,594
Been wondering
where you'd got to.

488
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:40,394
Darling, you know,
we really have to leave now.

489
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:42,867
Match starts in half an hour.
Harry's got a cricket match.

490
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,927
That is, you're still coming, right?
Yes, of course.

491
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:47,269
You're not too busy, no?
One sec.

492
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:49,332
Right. Okay.

493
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:52,242
Justin's waiting for you in the car.
All right. Tell him
I'll be right down.

494
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:01,616
Sandy, what do you think of me?

495
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,617
I think you're beautiful.
Do you?

496
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,627
Yes.
Really?

497
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:10,629
Yes.

498
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:13,666
Well, you can have me
if you show me the letter.

499
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:19,295
Ooh.

500
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,578
Are you serious?

501
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:29,639
Yeah.

502
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:36,148
When?

503
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:40,182
Um, when I get back from Loki.

504
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:45,024
Tessa,

505
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:48,033
If anyone ever found out—

506
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:51,036
I'd shown you the letter,
I'd be ruined.

507
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:53,368
No one's gonna know, Sandy.

508
00:40:09,723 --> 00:40:11,987
Put it back in the drawer.

509
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,550
Lock the drawer.
Put the key back.

510
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:19,231
Read it at once.

511
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:21,631
Promise?
Promise.

512
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,716
My continent, Africa, is staggering...

513
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:40,651
Under the weight of not one,
but three plagues.

514
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:43,986
Yet still the governments
of the U. S. A. And Europe,

515
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:47,754
At the behest of the pharmaceutical companies
that seem to control them,

516
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:52,060
Drag their feet and continue
to give us endless reasons...

517
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:58,037
Why we should buy your branded drugs
at five, 10, 20 times the price.

518
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,437
Sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.

519
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:02,907
Okay, well, if you're sure.

520
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:09,776
Is too hot to be
standing around.
Bye, Arnold.

521
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:15,716
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.

522
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,780
Bye, sweetheart.

523
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:20,452
See you in, uh— in a couple of days.

524
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:29,261
Tessa.
Tessa?

525
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:32,662
Yeah.

526
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:36,566
Inside a car and had been mutilated.
Turn it off, will you?

527
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:39,366
Certainly. Sorry.

528
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:51,575
Mr. Quayle!

529
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:03,554
Mustafa.

530
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:07,026
Mmm.

531
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:13,364
Tessa's family.
- Yes.

532
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,170
Police were here, bwana.
When?

533
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:19,804
This morning. They took away
Mama Tessa's things.

534
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,144
Better make a list
of whas missing.

535
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:24,206
Mustafa.

536
00:43:36,963 --> 00:43:39,022
See? I told you.

537
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,899
They took away the CD's,
the diskettes, the computer.

538
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:45,699
They came here and took the—
the files, the papers.

539
00:43:45,772 --> 00:43:49,833
Just didn't want to touch anything
so that you can come
and see for yourself what they did.

540
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,003
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Mustafa.

541
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,567
Dypraxa?

542
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,616
Huh.

543
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:58,939
Darling Tessa, you have hurt me
more than you know.

544
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:02,470
Trusting you to be honorable,
I afforded you, against all the rules,

545
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:05,609
An opportunity that you have abused
in the worst way.

546
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:10,952
I beg you, for the sake of my career,
to return what you took.

547
00:45:11,024 --> 00:45:13,822
If you will not, then at least save
what is left of me...

548
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:17,192
By chucking in your ridiculous sham
of a marriage, as I will mine,

549
00:45:17,264 --> 00:45:19,960
And bolting with me
to the end of the earth.

550
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:23,025
I love you, I love you...

551
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:25,094
And I love you.

552
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:27,662
Sandy.

553
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,845
I'm sorry to have been
so long, Sandy.

554
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:41,682
Seems they've been in here too.

555
00:45:41,755 --> 00:45:43,689
Anything missing
in the bedroom?

556
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:46,248
Her laptop's gone
and her disks and all her files.

557
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,693
Yes. Is a mess.

558
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:51,788
Whas in that?

559
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:54,663
Oh, uh, her will,

560
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:57,726
Amongst other things.
Oh.

561
00:45:57,804 --> 00:46:00,295
Seems she wanted
to be buried in Africa.

562
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,568
Oh.

563
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:06,305
Darling Tessa. Hmm.

564
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:30,999
Excuse me.

565
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:33,562
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

566
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,973
What are you doing?
Could someone please explain
what they're doing, please?

567
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:40,410
Look, Justin, it— is just concrete.
Is to keep the grave robbers out.

568
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:45,240
Tessa expressed a wish to lie...

569
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:49,220
In African soil,
not in bloody concrete.

570
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,757
Nothing can grow in concrete.

571
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,089
Kindly tell them to leave,
please, Ghita.

572
00:46:55,428 --> 00:46:59,262
And you too, please, gentlemen.
Thank you. It was kind of you to come.

573
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:29,618
Hello.

574
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:32,995
Kioko. Is Kioko?
Yes.

575
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:35,762
You're Wanza's brother.
Justin.
Yes.

576
00:47:35,835 --> 00:47:37,769
You brought a card for Tessa?
Yes.

577
00:47:37,837 --> 00:47:39,896
You walked here?
Did you walk?

578
00:47:39,973 --> 00:47:41,964
Thank you.

579
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:30,816
You'll always protect me, won't you?

580
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:35,452
Yeah. Of course.

581
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:38,793
Of course I'll protect you.
And I'm gonna protect you.

582
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:41,197
Justin?

583
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:43,531
Hi. You're a million miles away.

584
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:47,266
Yes, I was. Um, I'm taking refuge
in my nasturtium seeds.

585
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:51,672
Listen, you know—you know
that I'm here for you, don't you?

586
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:56,010
Yes, I do. Thank you, Ghita.
You're a good friend.

587
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:58,516
I, uh— I'm afraid I wanted
to ask you a question.

588
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,748
Rather a delicate question.
L—Well, maybe is indelicate.

589
00:49:04,123 --> 00:49:06,114
Um—
Anything.

590
00:49:07,494 --> 00:49:11,726
What do you think that Arnold and Tessa
were doing at Lake Turkana?

591
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:14,096
Oh, I see.

592
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:18,695
You know, they did spend
enough time together to give everyone
the impression that they were—

593
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:21,103
Come on, Justin.
You know what this place is like.

594
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:25,076
If you can't have sex, you have
other people's sex— real or imagined.

595
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,673
Who's this?
Is Claude.

596
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:31,683
Arnolïs boyfriend.

597
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:34,618
I'd never have guessed.

598
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:37,087
Is illegal here.
You don't shout about it.

599
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:40,519
Ah, well.

600
00:49:40,593 --> 00:49:42,584
Wish she coulïve told me.

601
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:44,926
Perhaps she didn't think
you needed to know.

602
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:01,970
Tessa Quayle I have,
but I have no Wanza Kilulu.
Are you sure that is the right name?

603
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:05,882
Uh, yes, Wanza Kilulu, and, uh, there was
a white doctor attending to her,

604
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,943
And he was there when she died.

605
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:11,752
Perhaps he conducted the postmortem.
Maybe you have a record of the postmortem.

606
00:50:11,824 --> 00:50:15,487
If I have no patiens record,
how can I have a postmortem record?

607
00:50:15,562 --> 00:50:17,928
And we don't have
European doctors working here.

608
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:20,659
Right, but her name is definitely
Wanza Kilulu,

609
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:23,896
And I remember that she was—
Well, if she does not appear
in my records here—

610
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,235
I'm sorry. She does not—
I don't think she was—
Yes. No, I understand.

611
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:30,799
I mean, I'm not mad here.
She was in the bed.
Okay, fine, yeah. I'm sorry.

612
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:58,603
You want money?

613
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:03,542
Fifty.

614
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,443
Fifty. Fifty.

615
00:51:20,426 --> 00:51:22,018
Sorry.

616
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:27,965
He helped my wife,
and I'm trying to find him.

617
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,662
I think he lives here,
but I have no idea where he is.

618
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:40,573
Is a family. You don't know him?

619
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:43,582
Kioko Kilulu.
Kioko Kilulu?

620
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,641
Yes, a name. Do you know?

621
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:48,380
Who is it? Who is it?
Is a family, from here.

622
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:54,188
He's a young boy, about 12. No?

623
00:51:59,565 --> 00:52:01,556
Kioko?

624
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:03,568
Kioko, hello.
Hello.

625
00:52:03,636 --> 00:52:05,900
Do— Do you remember me?

626
00:52:05,972 --> 00:52:07,963
I've been looking for you.

627
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,839
No trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I just want to talk to you.

628
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,038
Is this the clinic
where Wanza was treated?

629
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:24,882
I cannot help you without—

630
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:31,258
Next.

631
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:35,896
Can I help you?
Why—Why was that lady
turned away?

632
00:52:35,968 --> 00:52:40,234
She refuses treatment.
But she seemed to want
to have treatment.

633
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:44,140
She's a T. B. Patient
who discontinued her treatment.
Her card was canceled.

634
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,737
Isn't that all the more reason
to inoculate her child?

635
00:52:47,814 --> 00:52:51,944
This is diphtheria vaccine.
What is your business here, please?

636
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,680
My name is Quayle.
I'm from the British High Commission.

637
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,086
Do you see any of your countrymen
here, Mr. Quayle?

638
00:52:57,156 --> 00:53:00,887
Uh, excuse me one—
May I see your card, Kioko?

639
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:04,653
I see. This is in Wanza's name.

640
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:07,495
Thas the family—
Is a family medical card, right?
Yes.

641
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:10,593
And what does "I. C." mean?
It means informed consent.

642
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,436
It means they consented to treatment
and have family medical entitlement.

643
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:16,498
And that treatment is Dypraxa?

644
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:22,006
But if they don't give consent,
then they lose the right to medical care?

645
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:26,415
Is not much of a choice, is it?
I suppose they're not even informed
that they're testing a new drug?

646
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:29,148
- I don't make the rules, Mr. Quayle.
- Mr. Quayle?

647
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:31,884
Yes?
Will you please
come with us?

648
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:37,628
Kioko, there's your card.
Thank you.

649
00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:53,812
Why is the child
being questioned?
Is okay.

650
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,286
Why did you come to talk to this boy?

651
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,555
He attended my wife's funeral,
so I came to thank him.

652
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:11,119
For a diplomat,
you're not a very good liar.

653
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:13,290
Well, I haven't risen very high.

654
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:15,357
We know about your wife,
Mr. Quayle.

655
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:20,798
He was her lover— this, uh, Bluhm.

656
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,068
So people are pleased to tell me.

657
00:54:26,145 --> 00:54:28,340
These men you hired to kill them—

658
00:54:28,414 --> 00:54:30,882
They rape and kill her,
and they let him go.

659
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,350
Where did you find them?

660
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:36,684
Well, perhaps I asked a policeman.
Can you tell me what
I'm doing here, please?

661
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,418
We've been asked to... keep you here.

662
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:42,052
Right. Help us help you.
I'm sorry. Could you explain?

663
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:46,496
I have not acquired a taste
for Kenyan tea, I'm afraid.

664
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:50,002
Look, we're trying to help you.
You help us, we help you.

665
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:54,233
If you give us something small,
we can always say we didn't find you.

666
00:54:54,307 --> 00:54:56,901
Don't you believe I have the power
to let you go?

667
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:00,477
Can I help you?
Yes.

668
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:04,243
My name is Woodrow,
Acting Head of Mission
for Her Majesty's government.

669
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:06,581
This is Detective Inspector Deasey
of Scotland Yard.

670
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:09,883
Mr. Deasey will be inquiring
into the death of Mr. Quayle's wife.

671
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:13,084
If you have any questions,
ask them of him.

672
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:15,389
Is that clear?

673
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:17,691
You weren't mistreated?
No.

674
00:55:17,763 --> 00:55:21,756
You know whose territory you are in, Mr. —
What did you say your name was?

675
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:24,530
And your name is?

676
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,538
Right.

677
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:28,938
The, uh—The boy Kioko
who I came to see—

678
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:32,136
What have you done with him?
He ran away.

679
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:34,441
I hope nothing's happened to him.

680
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,041
Where's your car, Justin?
Is near the market.

681
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,757
Is that the official thinking then—
that Arnold killed Tessa?

682
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:53,822
I'm afraid thas looking likely.

683
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,630
Do you think
that he was her lover?

684
00:55:56,702 --> 00:55:59,500
I'm afraid thas looking likely too.

685
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,904
What were they doing
up at Lake Turkana?

686
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:07,034
Romantic setting.
Sorry to have to say it, old chap.

687
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,310
But why suspect Bluhm then?
I mean, there may have been others—

688
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:13,375
Other lovers.

689
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:16,615
If she was an unfaithful wife,
why stop at Arnold?

690
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:19,453
I wouldn't listen to rumor,

691
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:21,516
Unless you've evidence?

692
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:25,086
Yes, evidence.
Thas always the problem.

693
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:27,428
Justin,

694
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,434
Be a good chap
and leave this to us.

695
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:31,868
There are proper channels
for these things.

696
00:56:54,093 --> 00:56:56,618
Ghita, hi. Thanks for coming.

697
00:56:56,696 --> 00:57:00,393
So why did you want to meet here?
Something that we shouldn't
be seen talking about?

698
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:03,128
Dypraxa.

699
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:09,668
I know that Tessa and Arnold
wrote a report
on the Three Bees trials,

700
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:11,801
And I need to know
what happened to it.

701
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:16,640
What makes you think I know?

702
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:19,685
Because they trusted you,
and so do I.

703
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:24,252
Help me, please, Ghita.

704
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:31,725
All I know is that Tessa
gave Sandy a copy.

705
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:34,561
Sandy? Why him?

706
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,868
Sandy was a compromise—
semiofficial.

707
00:57:40,172 --> 00:57:42,436
Arnold wanted to go public with it.
Tessa wouldn't.

708
00:57:42,508 --> 00:57:46,569
Because?
Because she wanted to do it your way,
through channels.

709
00:57:46,645 --> 00:57:48,704
But, Justin, I wouldn't bother
looking for it.

710
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:52,945
If it threatens British commercial interests,
it woulïve been shredded.
She coulïve brought it to me.

711
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:55,954
She didn't want
to get you involved.
Why?

712
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:03,584
Ghita, why didn't she
want me involved?
To protect you.

713
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:12,237
Do you know if she showed
the report to anyone else?

714
00:58:12,304 --> 00:58:14,295
Kenny Curtiss.

715
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:20,612
Time of the month, Kenny?

716
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,670
Fuck off.

717
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,739
Might help if you took
the fucking flag out.

718
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:27,752
Well, get closer to the fucking hole,
and maybe I will.

719
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:31,854
Interesting man you got there, Crick.

720
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:33,915
Must be the only white caddy in Africa.

721
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:39,498
Look, KDH are waiting for me
to default on my Dypraxa commitments,

722
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:41,556
And I have a cash flow problem.

723
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:44,125
What are you lot going to do about it?

724
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:48,035
We never promised
to protect you commercially.

725
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:51,666
You protect me?
Thas fucking rich.

726
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:54,736
A word or two from me
in the right black ear,
a couple of cases of Krug,

727
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:56,805
And you'd be on the next plane
back home.

728
00:58:56,882 --> 00:59:00,613
I mean, I spend more money
on champagne in a year
than your shop's annual fucking budget.

729
00:59:00,686 --> 00:59:04,417
Oh, there you go—
Cause of your cash-flow problem.

730
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,481
You're in my eyeline, old chap.

731
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,722
You're what passes for James Bond
around here.

732
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:13,287
Get Her Majesty's secret service
to pull a few strings.
Is what you spies do, isn't it?

733
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:16,357
Is it?

734
00:59:16,435 --> 00:59:18,835
Never really sure what it is we do.

735
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:24,369
Don't even think about
bullying me, old man.

736
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:27,708
I'm not a member of your gentlemen's club.
I don't have to play by the rules.

737
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,146
So it seems.

738
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:32,207
Call that one in, shall we?

739
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:40,256
Mr. Curtiss, I'm sorry
to disturb your game.

740
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,988
My name is Justin Quayle
from the High Commission.

741
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,223
I believe you knew my wife, Tessa.

742
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:47,857
Justin. Didn't know
you were a member here.

743
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:49,867
Yes, I met her
at one of your parties.

744
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:52,096
She came to see you, I think.

745
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,231
She gave you a report
that she had written on Dypraxa.

746
00:59:55,307 --> 00:59:58,902
Justin, I really don't think
this is the time or the place—

747
00:59:58,978 --> 01:00:02,675
I hope you didn't find her too troublesome,
because she could be a terrier
when she had a scent.

748
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:05,410
Huh, sounds like you're
describing a bitch.

749
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,888
I'm sorry about your loss,

750
01:00:10,956 --> 01:00:12,947
But I don't remember
being given any report.

751
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:16,460
Well, thas odd,
because she noted it in her diary.

752
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,430
Then you know more than I do.

753
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:26,402
Didn't know, uh—
Didn't know Tessa kept a diary.

754
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:31,236
Well, I think Tessa was right then, Tim.
You don't know everything.

755
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:35,376
I know where you're going
on Tuesday.

756
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:07,311
Next, please.

757
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:12,048
Sorry about the weather.

758
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:14,176
Is hardly your fault.

759
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,483
Oh, dear. We've had some forgeries
on the diplomatics.

760
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:18,489
I'm gonna have to keep this,
I'm afraid, sir.

761
01:01:18,557 --> 01:01:22,550
- What?
- The F. C. O. Will issue you
with a new one in a few days.

762
01:01:23,629 --> 01:01:27,087
What if I want to travel with it?
Just two, three days at the most.

763
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:30,431
Are you saying thas a forgery?
It does happen, sir,
even on diplomatics.

764
01:01:30,502 --> 01:01:34,529
But that was issued to me a year ago
by the diplomatic office—
Sir, the F. C. O. Will take care of that.

765
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:05,367
Is just here on the right.

766
01:02:22,288 --> 01:02:24,222
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.

767
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,690
Let me take that for you.
Oh, I'd rather keep it with me.

768
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:29,489
Uh, club rule, Justin.
I'm sorry.

769
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:32,029
No— No luggage in the, uh—
in the dining room.

770
01:02:32,097 --> 01:02:36,261
Could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole,
please, Jimmy? Thank you.
Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir.

771
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:40,237
My dear fellow, what a dreadful time
you've had. Welcome home.
Thank you, Bernard.

772
01:02:40,306 --> 01:02:44,367
Any, uh, plans,
or is it too soon?
Plans?

773
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:47,037
Well, holiday, visiting friends,

774
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:50,275
The million things you've always wanted
Mmm.

775
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:54,183
You're on indefinite sick leave.
Enjoy it.

776
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:57,416
I hear the, uh— the snow's
very good at Chamonix.

777
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:00,822
I don't have a passport, Bernard.
They took mine at the airport.

778
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:04,556
Oh, of course, yes.
You missed the, um—
You missed the recall.

779
01:03:05,664 --> 01:03:09,794
Mmm. The sole meuniere's
not bad here,

780
01:03:09,868 --> 01:03:12,268
lf— if you like sole.

781
01:03:12,338 --> 01:03:15,171
Otherwise have it grilled.
Grilleïll be fine.

782
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:19,400
Um, no starters, I think.

783
01:03:24,516 --> 01:03:26,507
You've been cleared, by the way.

784
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:29,554
Thought we'd get that bit
of unpleasantness dealt with first.

785
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:32,351
Cleared for what?
Um, of what.

786
01:03:32,424 --> 01:03:34,892
Uh, murder most foul.

787
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,691
Seems you didn't hire
contract killers
in a den of vice after all.

788
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:42,427
Deasey is satisfied
it was a crime of passion
by our dark medical horse.

789
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:44,492
Is just a question now
of finding Bluhm.

790
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,595
Arnold Bluhm is gay,
Bernard.

791
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:49,334
Gay men don't rape
their women friends.

792
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,504
Well, I've known one or two
very savage queens in my time.

793
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:58,744
Do you no good to go poking around
under rocks, Justin.

794
01:03:58,817 --> 01:04:01,786
Some very nasty things
live under rocks,

795
01:04:01,854 --> 01:04:03,845
Especially in foreign gardens.

796
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:08,086
Advice of a friend.
What is it that I'm not
to look into, Bernard?

797
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,958
Quayles have always made
reliable foreign service men.

798
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:15,159
Shouldn't be surprised
if you've still got a small
Head of Mission in your knapsack.

799
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:18,465
Challenging post.
More challenging than
dealing with Kenny Curtiss?

800
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:23,935
He's a crude sort of chap, our Kenny,
but he flies the flag for us.

801
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:26,705
He got up dear Tessa's nose, I fear.

802
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,043
- Yes, she wrote a report about it.
- About Kenny?

803
01:04:29,114 --> 01:04:31,105
No, about Dypraxa.
Ah, that.

804
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:35,142
She expected some action to be taken,
but none was, was it?

805
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,950
She tell you about the letter,
or did you find it among her things?

806
01:04:38,023 --> 01:04:41,959
Tucked into her diary,
perhaps?
What letter is that, Bernard?

807
01:04:42,027 --> 01:04:46,964
Ramblings of an aging fart.
Senility setting in early, alas.

808
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:50,365
Naughty of her to take it though.
Very naughty indeed.

809
01:04:50,436 --> 01:04:52,336
Yes, I found that.

810
01:04:52,404 --> 01:04:55,066
Be grateful to have it back.
Written under stress, you understand.

811
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:58,132
Regrettable things said. Wouldn't
want it falling into the wrong hands.

812
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:00,872
Sorry, Bernard.
Are we talking about the same letter?

813
01:05:00,946 --> 01:05:02,880
Whas yours about?

814
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,477
Undying love.

815
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:09,487
Ah.

816
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:15,857
Whas yours?

817
01:05:15,928 --> 01:05:19,989
They're not so good grilled.
You shoulïve had the meuniere.

818
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:23,095
Ladies and gentlemen—

819
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:43,415
Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep all your belongings
with you at all times.

820
01:05:59,204 --> 01:06:01,069
Is good to see you, Ham.

821
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,233
Sorry about the blubbing.
Is those bloody Latin genes,
you know.

822
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:06,243
Is the same old Ham.

823
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:08,802
Oh, no. No, not anymore.

824
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,577
God, I loved her rotten.

825
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,584
And she loved you rotten.

826
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:17,554
First cousins can be closer
than siblings.

827
01:06:17,623 --> 01:06:21,252
I still don't understand why I let you
talk me out of going to the funeral.

828
01:06:21,326 --> 01:06:24,352
It was the wrong crowd for you, Ham.
We'll have a private memorial service here.

829
01:06:24,429 --> 01:06:27,626
You can blub
all your way through it.
Don't think I won't.

830
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:30,668
Hire the Abbey.
You can afford it now.
Can I?

831
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:35,400
Tess left you bloody well off.
Want to know what you're worth?
Not particularly.

832
01:06:35,474 --> 01:06:39,672
Oh, I've got the keys to the Chelsea house.
Thought you might want to stay there
while you're in London.

833
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,736
No, I'd rather not.
Well, is all yours.

834
01:06:41,813 --> 01:06:44,179
That and her African women's charity.

835
01:06:44,249 --> 01:06:46,809
Said it would get you
out of the garden.
When did she say that?

836
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:49,410
Two weeks before she died.

837
01:06:50,822 --> 01:06:53,848
Look, I am ravenous.
Have you had lunch?

838
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,861
Yes, I have. A very civilized lunch
with Bernard Pellegrin...

839
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:00,922
Who expressed an interest
in Tessa's diary.

840
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:03,263
But Tess never kept a diary.
She hated the things.

841
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:07,465
You and I know that.
Pellegrin must have been disinformed.

842
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:12,340
Tess thought she was being watched.
Didn't stop her e-mailing twice a day.

843
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:15,437
More inquiries than Google.

844
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,312
Look at him.
The boy is two-thirds machine.

845
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:21,716
I'm telling you, is scary.
Mind of a computer.

846
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:25,223
Appetite of a waste disposal.
And whas the other third?

847
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:28,350
Oh, Manzini, unquestionably.

848
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:31,225
Those e-mails from Tess—
Guido helped me with them.

849
01:07:31,296 --> 01:07:33,230
Company stuff. Boring.

850
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:36,961
Mm. Ownership, franchises,
that sort of thing.

851
01:07:37,035 --> 01:07:39,560
I'm trying to find out
who brokered the marriage.

852
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:43,540
What marriage?
KDH and Three Bees.

853
01:07:43,609 --> 01:07:47,636
KDH make Dypraxa.
Three Bees test it.

854
01:07:47,713 --> 01:07:51,877
Is a marriage of convenience, of course.
Both in it for what they can get out of it.

855
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,714
That phrase about the marriage—
Is that Tess's phrase or yours?

856
01:07:54,786 --> 01:07:57,084
Oh, hers. Hers.

857
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:01,189
Producing dead offspring.

858
01:08:01,259 --> 01:08:04,160
Oh, this is so good!
Why don't you try some.

859
01:08:04,229 --> 01:08:07,062
It looks disgusting.

860
01:08:07,132 --> 01:08:09,965
I can get that stuff
through her mirror server.

861
01:08:10,035 --> 01:08:13,334
Well, how do you do that?
All you need is the password. Duh.

862
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:15,737
Yeah, but I don't have her password.

863
01:08:15,807 --> 01:08:18,367
Come on, Jus.
Five letters. Three guesses.

864
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:20,911
- I have no idea.
- My name— Guido.

865
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:24,540
She used the one for the "l"
and the zero for the "O."

866
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:28,383
- I set it up for her.
- Wait, wait.

867
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:32,446
- Give him a chance to read it.
- Lightning tour. I'm printing as I go.

868
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,692
Whas Hippo?

869
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:39,390
German— German Pharma Watch.

870
01:08:39,464 --> 01:08:41,398
Keep an eye on what
the drug companies are up to.

871
01:08:44,403 --> 01:08:47,065
Copy that.

872
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,208
KDH. Can we open that?

873
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:55,746
Sure. No problem.

874
01:08:55,814 --> 01:08:58,715
A new plague is sweeping the world.

875
01:08:58,784 --> 01:09:04,222
In the 21st century, multi-resistant
T. B. Will kill one in three.

876
01:09:04,289 --> 01:09:07,315
- But now there is hope.
- Is huge, isn't it?

877
01:09:07,392 --> 01:09:12,056
KDH is developing a revolutionary
treatment for T. B. Sufferers.
Is global.

878
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:16,464
We call it Dypraxa.
You will call it life.

879
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:18,560
And I call it a blockbuster.

880
01:09:18,637 --> 01:09:23,097
Karel Delacourt Hudson.
The world is our clinic.

881
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:26,110
Is gonna sell like hotcakes.

882
01:09:26,178 --> 01:09:30,444
- Can you magnify that photograph?
- Magnify it? He can send it out
for doughnuts.

883
01:09:36,254 --> 01:09:39,553
Is it possible to zoom in on it?
Yeah, sure.

884
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:45,788
Is Pellegrin.
Why is he there?

885
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:48,128
There's a personal file.
Do you mind if I open it?

886
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,430
No, sure. Go ahead.

887
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,001
Ti amo.

888
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:04,480
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours to translate.

889
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:07,609
He's got very delicate little ears.

890
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:11,053
He's dreaming
about his favorite things.

891
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:14,183
He's dreaming about...

892
01:10:14,259 --> 01:10:17,660
A world without any weeds.

893
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,826
Justin Quayle,
is time to get up.

894
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:28,168
Go away.
You're very annoying.
Time to get up, Justin.

895
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,007
Get up.

896
01:10:37,783 --> 01:10:42,277
This is really just not fair.

897
01:10:42,354 --> 01:10:44,879
Is time to get up.

898
01:10:44,956 --> 01:10:48,255
Tessa, just let me sleep.

899
01:10:48,326 --> 01:10:50,692
There's gardening to be done.

900
01:10:50,762 --> 01:10:54,061
Weeds to be pulled out.

901
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:58,495
Good morning.
Come back to bed.

902
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:02,639
Good morning.

903
01:11:02,707 --> 01:11:04,732
Oh, sweetheart.

904
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:21,088
Moral dilemma, Ham.

905
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:24,959
And the person that I most
want to tell can't be told.

906
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:30,862
I had a creepy love letter today.

907
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:33,029
Is not your fault.

908
01:11:33,104 --> 01:11:35,402
From a five-star creep.

909
01:11:35,473 --> 01:11:37,964
You've got to move on, huh?

910
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:41,604
I've cold-bloodedly led on.

911
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,116
I stole something from him.

912
01:11:45,183 --> 01:11:49,244
And worse,
I made him a vile promise...

913
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:54,554
That I have absolutely
no intention of keeping.

914
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:59,086
Oh, do come in.
Yeah, please. Of course.

915
01:11:59,164 --> 01:12:01,359
Thank you.

916
01:12:01,433 --> 01:12:04,095
You lead the way.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.

917
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:09,732
I really hate to think how
it would hurt Justin if he knew.

918
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:12,675
I've violated his code, Ham,

919
01:12:12,744 --> 01:12:16,373
In the most cynical way.

920
01:12:16,448 --> 01:12:19,781
And the end
that justifies my means?

921
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:24,948
I need this creep to help me
blackmail Her Majesty's government.

922
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:29,084
Please tell me I'm not a ruthless bitch.

923
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,824
Please tell me that Justin
would understand if he knew.

924
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:37,266
If you give me the wrong answer,
then I will push you into the Tiber...

925
01:12:37,335 --> 01:12:39,963
Like I did when we were 16.

926
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:43,131
Ciao, my darling.

927
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,369
Thank you.

928
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:52,041
For this wonderful gift.

929
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,211
How very generous of me.

930
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:58,188
No, l—

931
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:14,898
Here, Justin, put this on.

932
01:13:30,722 --> 01:13:33,714
I like it here.
This is where you work from?
Mm.

933
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:36,386
Amnesty.

934
01:13:36,461 --> 01:13:38,395
Won't make any difference.

935
01:13:38,463 --> 01:13:40,624
Thas the official line
of the Foreign Office.

936
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:44,863
I thought you were like that.
I thought you were one of those
privileged revolutionaries.

937
01:13:56,514 --> 01:14:00,177
- My lady.
- Am I?

938
01:14:00,251 --> 01:14:04,745
These plants— If they were children,
you'd be prosecuted.

939
01:14:04,823 --> 01:14:08,919
I do water them.
When I remember.

940
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:18,200
You say you're all into saving lives
around the world,

941
01:14:18,269 --> 01:14:20,897
But you let your poor plants die.

942
01:14:20,972 --> 01:14:23,805
I say put people first.

943
01:14:26,845 --> 01:14:30,246
Why don't you water them?
You're being cruel.

944
01:14:31,483 --> 01:14:33,815
I feel safe with you.

945
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:37,746
I can imagine when you were six.

946
01:14:37,822 --> 01:14:39,790
You leading the revolution.

947
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:56,039
Ham? Hi. Is Justin.
Listen.

948
01:14:56,107 --> 01:15:00,237
Do you still represent that
dodgy client in Amsterdam?

949
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:05,740
Sorry.

950
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:11,587
Sorry. Sorry. I only just got it.
Directions for use.

951
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:14,557
No air travel, no credit cards.

952
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,720
Never say your name on the phone,
or the computers will kick in.

953
01:15:17,796 --> 01:15:20,162
Dodgy client adds,
"Welcome to my world."

954
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:22,995
Well, I don't want his world.
No choice, old chum.

955
01:15:23,068 --> 01:15:25,229
Actually, I'm getting
a bit paranoid myself.

956
01:15:25,303 --> 01:15:28,295
Look, suppose I posited
that all this was just coincidence—

957
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:30,341
Tess killed by bandits,
pure and simple...

958
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:32,569
And that you're being
as paranoid as she was.

959
01:15:32,644 --> 01:15:34,839
Ham.

960
01:15:37,849 --> 01:15:39,942
Thanks for trying, Ham.

961
01:15:40,018 --> 01:15:42,816
I have to finish what she started.

962
01:15:42,887 --> 01:15:45,822
Well, look, look. I've got the address
of Aunt Claudia, the old bat in Rome.

963
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:48,688
If you need to contact me,
you'd better do it through her.

964
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,990
She adored Tess.

965
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:55,798
I failed her, Ham.

966
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:57,926
I lost my faith in her.

967
01:15:58,002 --> 01:15:59,867
No, she forgives you.

968
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:03,834
She loved you rotten too,
you know.

969
01:16:03,908 --> 01:16:06,638
You think?
Oh, yeah.

970
01:16:10,248 --> 01:16:12,182
Thank you.

971
01:17:06,604 --> 01:17:09,801
It seems our erstwhile colleague
has disappeared.

972
01:17:09,874 --> 01:17:13,708
Four days ago he lunched
in London with Pellegrin,

973
01:17:13,778 --> 01:17:19,216
Who describes him as overwrought,
after which he visited his wife's lawyer...

974
01:17:19,284 --> 01:17:21,809
Before going off our radar.

975
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:25,185
The poor man seems
to have convinced himself...

976
01:17:25,256 --> 01:17:29,989
There was a conspiracy against Tessa
in which we are all complicit.

977
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:35,355
If he has left the U.K.,
he did so without a passport.

978
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:40,268
Therefore, any contact from Justin
must be reported to me immediately.

979
01:17:40,338 --> 01:17:42,670
In his own best interest.

980
01:17:44,609 --> 01:17:47,908
No point asking if you've
heard from him, I suppose?

981
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:50,743
No, no, Tim, none at all.

982
01:17:50,815 --> 01:17:55,809
Birgit, why are Three Bees spending
$70 million testing Dypraxa for KDH?

983
01:17:55,887 --> 01:17:58,185
I mean, is the African market
worth that much?

984
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,588
Tessa, you have to understand
the scale of this.

985
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:04,355
There is a T. B. Epidemic coming.
It will affect the entire world.

986
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:08,593
Or, put into the language that stock
exchanges all over the world understand,

987
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:11,328
If the T. B. Market performs as forecast,

988
01:18:11,402 --> 01:18:14,371
Billions and billions of dollars
are waiting to be earned.

989
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,839
And the boy to earn them is Dypraxa.

990
01:18:16,908 --> 01:18:20,139
Lf, of course,
the preliminary trials in Africa...

991
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:23,339
Have not thrown up
any disturbing side effects.

992
01:18:43,534 --> 01:18:46,970
Ich suche Birgit.

993
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,245
Ich bin Justin Quayle,

994
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,543
Tessa Quayle's Ehemann.

995
01:19:04,589 --> 01:19:08,582
Michael Adams.

996
01:19:17,435 --> 01:19:19,369
Okay, Herr Adams.

997
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:25,075
She collects Karl at 3:00
from the kindergarten at Bahnhofstrasse.

998
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,426
Karl, here.

999
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,305
Birgit.

1000
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:02,312
You sent this to my wife.

1001
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,314
Justin.

1002
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,783
I need to talk to you.
Our computers
were stolen last night.

1003
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:09,843
Yes, I know.
They have never gone
this far before.

1004
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:12,287
I can't be seen with you.
Sorry. I've Karl to think of.

1005
01:20:12,357 --> 01:20:14,416
Is there some safe place
we could talk?

1006
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:16,756
Nowhere. Nowhere safe.
Nowhere?

1007
01:20:16,828 --> 01:20:19,820
Please. Just... a few questions.

1008
01:20:19,897 --> 01:20:22,627
Okay, les talk here.
With these people.
All right.

1009
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,636
Okay. My bike's across the street.
Ask your questions before we get to it.

1010
01:20:26,704 --> 01:20:28,137
Is it a scam?
Scam?

1011
01:20:28,206 --> 01:20:31,642
Dypraxa.
Does it cure T. B?
Yes, it cures.

1012
01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:34,940
But it can also kill, you know,
because they haven't got
the formula right.

1013
01:20:35,012 --> 01:20:37,742
Right. So why don't they work on that?

1014
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:45,152
Is cheaper to fix the trials.

1015
01:20:45,223 --> 01:20:47,589
Exclude the patients that
have side effects, you know.

1016
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:50,593
To go back to the lab would
cost them time— two years—

1017
01:20:50,661 --> 01:20:54,927
Millions of dollars, and other companies
would have time to produce their own cures.

1018
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:56,990
Okay, next question.

1019
01:20:57,068 --> 01:20:59,593
You said to Tessa in your e-mails
that the Kenyan government
had approved the trials.

1020
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:02,195
Somebody bribed them.
Who?

1021
01:21:02,273 --> 01:21:04,673
Three Bees, Lorbeer.
We don't know.

1022
01:21:04,742 --> 01:21:09,042
But $50,000 in the right hands,
and you can test battery acid
as skin lotion.

1023
01:21:09,113 --> 01:21:11,172
My bike's there.

1024
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:14,218
Stop! Stop!

1025
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:17,118
Stop!

1026
01:21:41,212 --> 01:21:44,238
Who is Lorbeer?

1027
01:21:44,315 --> 01:21:46,715
Birgit, is it a company?

1028
01:21:46,784 --> 01:21:49,651
A white coat.
He invented Dypraxa.

1029
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,813
When patients started to die,
Lorbeer jumped clear.

1030
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:55,518
Is that why Tessa went to Lokichogio?
Is that where Lorbeer is?

1031
01:21:55,593 --> 01:21:57,652
Disappeared.
Murdered?

1032
01:21:57,728 --> 01:22:00,595
Disappeared.
We've gotta go. I'm sorry.

1033
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,599
Where can I find him?

1034
01:22:17,114 --> 01:22:20,515
Birgit? Where?

1035
01:22:20,585 --> 01:22:23,520
Go back to Africa.
Lorbeer's still there.

1036
01:24:30,748 --> 01:24:34,240
Tessa, why didn't you tell me?

1037
01:24:36,053 --> 01:24:38,146
I could have helped you.

1038
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,991
It is my sad duty to inform you
that Dr. Bluhm has been found.

1039
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:49,089
I'll spare you the details.

1040
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:52,033
Suffice to say, the poor fellow...

1041
01:24:52,103 --> 01:24:55,834
Seems to have been tortured to death
on the same day Tessa was killed.

1042
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:58,340
Which would seem to exonerate him.

1043
01:24:58,409 --> 01:25:00,877
Seem? So whas the new theory?

1044
01:25:00,945 --> 01:25:03,209
That he tortured himself to death?

1045
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,373
Thad save you looking
for anyone else, wouldn't it?

1046
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:07,178
Moving on.

1047
01:25:15,426 --> 01:25:17,951
What is the purpose of your visit?

1048
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,963
I'm seeing a friend.

1049
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:25,560
Welcome to Kenya, Mr. Black.
Thank you.

1050
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:28,796
Has anyone seen
Three Bees' share price lately?

1051
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:34,238
Does that mean he won't be able
to contribute to tombola?

1052
01:25:34,311 --> 01:25:38,247
Hardly Kenny's fault if someone
put the word out on him.

1053
01:25:38,315 --> 01:25:41,443
Wish I'd know thas all it took.
I'd have done it sooner.

1054
01:25:41,519 --> 01:25:45,888
I expect he'll land on his feet.
Give him a life peerage.

1055
01:25:45,956 --> 01:25:51,053
Henceforth you shall be known as
Lord fucking Curtiss of fucking Kenya.

1056
01:26:07,978 --> 01:26:12,608
Whoever you are, I don't
take kindly to being blackmailed.

1057
01:26:17,288 --> 01:26:21,349
Christ. How did you get here?

1058
01:26:21,425 --> 01:26:24,690
Safari tour. Via Paris.

1059
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,026
Hunting me now, Justin?

1060
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:30,431
You're the one on the run.

1061
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:36,328
I loved her.
I'm not ashamed of it.

1062
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:39,604
Nor should you be...
if it were true.

1063
01:26:40,044 --> 01:26:42,911
Is not for you to tell me
how I felt.

1064
01:26:45,182 --> 01:26:48,379
If you've read that, you'll see
that I let her read something
she shouldn't.

1065
01:26:48,452 --> 01:26:50,386
Yeah. A letter from Pellegrin.

1066
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:54,216
She trusted you.

1067
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,282
What do you want for that?

1068
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:01,696
I want to know why Pellegrin
suppressed Tessa's report.

1069
01:27:01,766 --> 01:27:05,361
It was him, wasn't it?
Don't try and play detective.

1070
01:27:05,436 --> 01:27:09,236
Three Bees, KDH, Dypraxa.
Whas the story on that axis of evil?

1071
01:27:09,306 --> 01:27:13,640
KDH is Swiss-Canadian.
So why are we involved?

1072
01:27:13,711 --> 01:27:16,475
Curtiss is one of us.
He's British.

1073
01:27:16,547 --> 01:27:19,914
Christ, Justin, stop bleeding
for bloody Africa
and show some loyalty.

1074
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,385
That plant KDH built in Wales
could have gone to France.

1075
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:25,854
Fifteen hundred jobs
in a depressed region.

1076
01:27:25,923 --> 01:27:28,221
We owed them.

1077
01:27:30,661 --> 01:27:33,755
They needed help
with the Dypraxa trials.

1078
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:37,028
KDH needed
an investment partner here.

1079
01:27:37,101 --> 01:27:40,662
Curtiss and Three Bees
served us both.

1080
01:27:40,738 --> 01:27:43,332
And Tessa wanted what?

1081
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:50,210
Pressure on Kenny...

1082
01:27:51,448 --> 01:27:54,383
To stop the tests,
redesign the bloody drug.

1083
01:27:57,488 --> 01:28:00,048
Three years' delay,
millions of dollars.

1084
01:28:01,826 --> 01:28:03,987
Or?

1085
01:28:04,061 --> 01:28:07,758
We're not paid
to be bleeding hearts.

1086
01:28:07,832 --> 01:28:09,766
You know that, Justin.

1087
01:28:11,435 --> 01:28:14,404
We're not killing people
who wouldn't be dead otherwise.

1088
01:28:15,673 --> 01:28:19,473
Look at the death rate.
Not that anybody's counting.

1089
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:23,411
But you were
a bleeding heart, Sandy.

1090
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:28,110
Tessa was your salvation,
wasn't she, from all this?

1091
01:28:29,553 --> 01:28:31,919
You loved her. Remember?

1092
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:36,993
Pellegrin said the report
was too damaging...

1093
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:39,154
And she had to be stopped.

1094
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:43,724
Oh, yes. She was stopped.

1095
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:48,638
I betrayed her.

1096
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:52,175
We all did.

1097
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:57,440
You did it by... growing flowers.

1098
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:06,184
How did you betray her, Sandy?

1099
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:12,923
They wanted to know
what she was up to.

1100
01:29:12,997 --> 01:29:16,626
I'm the one who told them
she was going to Loki.

1101
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:22,536
- Who did you tell?
- Pellegrin.

1102
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:27,638
But God knows who he told.

1103
01:30:01,612 --> 01:30:04,809
Ghita, get in the car.
Get in the car!

1104
01:30:04,882 --> 01:30:09,649
Go!

1105
01:30:21,298 --> 01:30:23,232
Get in.

1106
01:30:25,269 --> 01:30:27,203
Listen, fuckhead,
if I wanted you dead,

1107
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,205
I woulïve brought Crick with me.

1108
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:33,176
I wanna show you something.

1109
01:30:33,243 --> 01:30:36,178
Show me from there.

1110
01:30:36,246 --> 01:30:39,875
Don't mess me about.
I'm doing you a favor.

1111
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,759
How did you know where I'd be?

1112
01:30:57,835 --> 01:30:59,996
I've still got a friend or two, you know?

1113
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:06,335
We're marked men, Quayle.
They've called in my fucking bank loans.

1114
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:10,107
I'm finished.
They want you silenced.

1115
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:14,583
And they want another country's flag
flying over my pharma division.

1116
01:31:16,653 --> 01:31:21,317
So, you've been asking
about Wanza Kilulu.

1117
01:31:23,627 --> 01:31:28,621
She's under there,
covered in quicklime.

1118
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:31,668
Her and 62 others
who never officially existed.

1119
01:31:31,735 --> 01:31:33,669
Dypraxa?

1120
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:38,541
Yeah.

1121
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:43,668
Is that where I'm going?
Not on my agenda.

1122
01:31:47,384 --> 01:31:49,716
Then why are you
showing me this?

1123
01:31:51,055 --> 01:31:55,424
Les just say
if I'm going to the wall,
I want a trophy.

1124
01:31:55,492 --> 01:31:59,588
Thas what you lot do,
isn't it? Heads on walls.

1125
01:32:00,998 --> 01:32:03,626
I think I'll have Pellegrin's
fucking head on mine.

1126
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:10,866
So, now you know where it is.
I'm not taking any fucking questions.

1127
01:32:10,941 --> 01:32:14,138
What about Lorbeer?

1128
01:32:14,211 --> 01:32:18,511
That Bible-thumping bullshitter,
he's doing his penance in the Sudan.

1129
01:32:18,582 --> 01:32:20,948
Jesus the healer.

1130
01:32:33,831 --> 01:32:37,289
You don't know where I'm going?
You get one guess.

1131
01:32:40,704 --> 01:32:43,036
I'm gonna surprise you, Tess.

1132
01:32:43,107 --> 01:32:45,701
- I love this man.
- Hello.

1133
01:32:54,818 --> 01:33:00,188
I wish you had shared
just a few things.

1134
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:08,997
I love you.
I love you too.

1135
01:34:27,077 --> 01:34:30,706
Who did you think it was?

1136
01:34:30,781 --> 01:34:34,342
Fuck you, Donohue.
This is bandit country.

1137
01:34:38,455 --> 01:34:41,117
Did you tell Curtiss where I'd be?

1138
01:34:41,191 --> 01:34:43,125
Ghita's car?

1139
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:46,458
Well, Ghita's
my only friend here, Tim.

1140
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:48,998
I wouldn't want her
to get into trouble.
She won't.

1141
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:54,760
You do have another friend,
believe it or not.

1142
01:34:54,838 --> 01:34:57,773
You won't find what
you're looking for in Loki.

1143
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,301
Les be honest
with each other, shall we?

1144
01:35:01,378 --> 01:35:04,313
Thas a— a late career change
for you, Tim.

1145
01:35:05,582 --> 01:35:09,211
There's something else
we have in common, you and I.

1146
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:12,414
We'll both be dead by Christmas.

1147
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:15,219
There's a contract out on you.

1148
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:17,852
Same people who did for Tessa,
I shouldn't wonder.

1149
01:35:17,928 --> 01:35:19,862
Mine's cancer.

1150
01:35:21,965 --> 01:35:24,365
My pain is controllable.

1151
01:35:24,434 --> 01:35:28,632
I knew that you were ill.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

1152
01:35:28,705 --> 01:35:32,232
Yeah. Sandy tell you?

1153
01:35:32,309 --> 01:35:34,243
He fingered Tessa.

1154
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:36,472
He said he'd made a phone call.

1155
01:35:36,546 --> 01:35:40,880
He didn't know they'd kill her.
Silly sod was besotted with her.

1156
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:44,045
But thas the way it works
with corporate murder.

1157
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:47,056
Boss gets wind of something,
calls in his head of security,

1158
01:35:47,124 --> 01:35:51,493
Who talks to someone,
who talks to a friend of someone.

1159
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:54,462
Finishes up with an answering machine
in a rented office,

1160
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:57,295
A couple of sensitive gentlemen
in a blue pickup truck.

1161
01:35:57,367 --> 01:35:59,767
They will never know
who ordered the hit.

1162
01:36:02,739 --> 01:36:04,673
I can get you out of Kenya.

1163
01:36:04,741 --> 01:36:07,710
Is one of the few things
we still do well.

1164
01:36:07,778 --> 01:36:09,939
Drop it now, and is over.

1165
01:36:10,013 --> 01:36:12,379
I'll make sure word
gets to the right people.

1166
01:36:12,449 --> 01:36:16,579
Go home... and live.

1167
01:36:16,653 --> 01:36:19,213
But I don't have a home, Tim.

1168
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:21,257
Tessa was my home.

1169
01:36:25,028 --> 01:36:27,019
Know about Bluhm?

1170
01:36:27,097 --> 01:36:29,031
What about Bluhm?

1171
01:36:29,099 --> 01:36:31,567
Let me tell you
what you're facing.

1172
01:36:33,403 --> 01:36:36,998
They dragged him into the desert,
cut out his tongue,

1173
01:36:37,074 --> 01:36:40,771
Chopped off his manly apparatus
and stuffed them where his tongue had been.

1174
01:36:40,844 --> 01:36:42,937
Then they crucified the poor bugger.

1175
01:36:43,013 --> 01:36:47,211
Pathologiss opinion is
he was still alive when they nailed him up.

1176
01:36:47,284 --> 01:36:49,309
Of course, you might be lucky.

1177
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:52,412
It might be in their interest
to make yours look like suicide.

1178
01:36:52,489 --> 01:36:54,423
Which it is.

1179
01:36:54,491 --> 01:36:58,928
Balance of mind disturbed.
No fuss, no inquiry.

1180
01:36:58,995 --> 01:37:01,361
Nothing.
Right.

1181
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:04,195
Well, thank you for the warning.

1182
01:37:04,267 --> 01:37:06,462
You've been very kind.

1183
01:37:09,272 --> 01:37:11,570
I was afraid you'd say that.

1184
01:37:15,278 --> 01:37:17,405
In case you meet any bandits.

1185
01:38:21,778 --> 01:38:24,338
I, uh— I wondered
if you could help me.
Yes, sir?

1186
01:38:36,126 --> 01:38:38,321
Thank you for agreeing
to take me, Mr. —

1187
01:38:38,395 --> 01:38:41,364
Please. I can't hear you.
Please put these on.

1188
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:45,231
I said thank you
for taking me, Mr. Andika.

1189
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:48,567
Jonah. No formalities up here.

1190
01:38:48,638 --> 01:38:52,039
Do you know about
Southern Sudan, Mr. Black?

1191
01:38:52,108 --> 01:38:54,633
The place we're going to
is a food camp,

1192
01:38:54,711 --> 01:38:57,407
But on the way we must drop
to some villages.

1193
01:38:57,481 --> 01:39:00,917
We’re just about to do a live run.
Take a look.

1194
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:13,754
His name is Brandt,
this man you want to see.

1195
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:16,196
He works at the clinic up there.

1196
01:39:16,266 --> 01:39:19,201
He's a good man,
but he pushes God with the pills.

1197
01:39:19,269 --> 01:39:21,237
Don't get him started.

1198
01:39:28,478 --> 01:39:33,472
Better strap yourself in.
We're landing on the surface of the moon.

1199
01:40:16,826 --> 01:40:20,262
Hi. Uh, Robert Black,
freelance journalist.

1200
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:22,264
I'm looking for Dr. Brandt.

1201
01:40:22,332 --> 01:40:24,994
Dr. Brandt? Yeah, he's just here.
He's traveling over from the village.
Thank you.

1202
01:40:33,577 --> 01:40:36,603
- Dr. Brandt?
- I'll see you over by the tent.

1203
01:41:00,036 --> 01:41:02,834
My name is Robert Black.
I'm a freelance journalist.
Uh-huh.

1204
01:41:02,906 --> 01:41:06,103
I'm told that you're the man to talk to.
I don't know
about that, Mr. Black.

1205
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,610
But I can tell you whas
happening around here, yeah?
Good.

1206
01:41:08,678 --> 01:41:10,669
Meet my self-appointed
assistant, Abuk.

1207
01:41:10,747 --> 01:41:12,908
Abuk.
Hello. How are you?

1208
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:15,315
Hello. How are you?
I'm very well.

1209
01:41:15,385 --> 01:41:18,445
Follow me. Come this way.

1210
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:22,821
Youse need to go
all to the medical center,
quickly as possible.

1211
01:41:28,932 --> 01:41:31,594
I only give the food
to the women, Mr. Black.

1212
01:41:31,668 --> 01:41:35,365
The women make the homes.
The men make the wars... and hooch.

1213
01:41:35,438 --> 01:41:38,737
Adam was Goïs first draft.
He got it right with Eve.

1214
01:41:38,808 --> 01:41:40,935
You tell that
to your readers, Mr. Black.

1215
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:43,377
Is a philosophy
that I learned from my wife.

1216
01:41:43,446 --> 01:41:47,712
Cherish her, man. Cherish her.
One of Goïs finest creations.

1217
01:41:47,784 --> 01:41:50,446
Now I'll show you
what the devil's up to.

1218
01:42:07,937 --> 01:42:10,098
Our treatment center.
Pretty crude, isn't it?

1219
01:42:10,173 --> 01:42:12,767
Well, I've seen hospitals
little better. In Nairobi.

1220
01:42:12,842 --> 01:42:17,870
So have I. Gharan, what surprises
have they got in store for us this month?

1221
01:42:17,947 --> 01:42:22,384
Have you checked those things?
Ja? Should be 40 boxes.

1222
01:42:23,987 --> 01:42:27,445
Free medicines, Mr. Black.

1223
01:42:27,524 --> 01:42:29,890
Most of them well beyond
their sell-by date.

1224
01:42:29,959 --> 01:42:33,486
The drug companies donate them.
Is a tax break for them.

1225
01:42:33,563 --> 01:42:35,997
Disposable drugs
for disposable patients.

1226
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:39,763
Out here they have
absolutely no shelf life.

1227
01:42:39,836 --> 01:42:43,169
Safest thing to do
is incinerate them.

1228
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:51,610
Big pharmaceuticals are right up there
with the arms dealers.

1229
01:42:53,049 --> 01:42:55,574
This is how the world
fucks Africa, Mr. Black.

1230
01:42:55,652 --> 01:42:59,110
Blood on their hands?
Is how they expiate their guilt.

1231
01:42:59,189 --> 01:43:02,647
Pharmaceuticals,
the aid agencies, everybody.

1232
01:43:02,726 --> 01:43:06,162
This whole machine
is driven by guilt.

1233
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:08,459
Is it?

1234
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:11,295
And now you will sample
my goat stew. Come with me.

1235
01:43:16,372 --> 01:43:18,533
So tell me, Robert,

1236
01:43:18,608 --> 01:43:21,236
Do you believe an individual
can redeem himself by good acts?

1237
01:43:21,311 --> 01:43:23,245
Abuk.

1238
01:43:23,313 --> 01:43:25,975
I do, yes.

1239
01:43:26,049 --> 01:43:28,779
Maybe the redemption
is in the struggle, huh?

1240
01:43:28,852 --> 01:43:31,878
God has your head.
The devil has your balls.

1241
01:43:31,955 --> 01:43:34,287
So which particular devil had yours?

1242
01:43:34,357 --> 01:43:36,723
Oh, you don't want to know
about that, Robert.

1243
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:38,988
Whas your paper
really interested in?

1244
01:43:39,062 --> 01:43:41,860
In the big
pharmaceutical companies.

1245
01:43:41,931 --> 01:43:45,628
African guinea pigs.
Cheap trials for unsound drugs.

1246
01:43:45,702 --> 01:43:48,569
Uninformed consent extorted
with threats against children.
Who are you?

1247
01:43:48,638 --> 01:43:50,572
Christ!
Payoffs, cover-ups.

1248
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,074
You were in Nairobi.
At the hospital.
Unmarked graves.

1249
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:55,577
I knew I'd seen you
somewhere before.
Murder.

1250
01:43:55,645 --> 01:43:58,580
You're the husband.
Thas right, Dr. Lorbeer.

1251
01:43:58,648 --> 01:44:02,209
Markus! Markus!

1252
01:44:12,796 --> 01:44:15,594
Something's going on out there.
Why did my wife come here?

1253
01:44:15,665 --> 01:44:18,463
She—They had written this report.

1254
01:44:18,535 --> 01:44:21,436
Sixteen pages of inspired guesswork.

1255
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,836
I was supposed to provide
the missing clinical data.

1256
01:44:23,907 --> 01:44:26,774
Testify on tape.
And did you?

1257
01:44:26,843 --> 01:44:28,367
This could be a raid.

1258
01:44:37,987 --> 01:44:41,388
Tribesman. Nasty.
They steal cattle, food, children.

1259
01:44:41,457 --> 01:44:45,018
- I think maybe we should leave.
- Did you testify on tape?

1260
01:44:45,094 --> 01:44:47,961
She was a very persuasive woman,
your wife, Mr. Quayle.

1261
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:50,295
And, no, I do not have the tape.
They took the tape.

1262
01:44:50,366 --> 01:44:55,235
But you kept a copy
of the report, yes?
Yes, I did. You're welcome to it.

1263
01:44:57,674 --> 01:45:00,905
Level four alert!
They're leaving in five minutes.

1264
01:45:00,977 --> 01:45:05,414
If you don't want to die, my friend,
you'd better come with me to the airstrip.

1265
01:45:05,481 --> 01:45:06,914
Hurry.

1266
01:45:18,962 --> 01:45:22,329
- We can still make it.
- What were Tessa and Bluhm
doing at Lake Turkana?

1267
01:45:22,398 --> 01:45:24,958
Are you crazy?
We've got to get out of here, man.

1268
01:45:25,034 --> 01:45:27,332
I mean, these people,
they kill anybody. Sorry.

1269
01:45:27,403 --> 01:45:29,997
Have you lost your senses?

1270
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:32,598
- There was something else!
There was a letter!

1271
01:45:32,675 --> 01:45:35,439
Look, you're a lunatic.
Do you know what you're doing?

1272
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:38,071
You're killing us both.
We'll take our chances with them.

1273
01:47:09,806 --> 01:47:11,933
No!

1274
01:47:48,611 --> 01:47:51,045
Get down!

1275
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:29,174
Abuk!

1276
01:48:31,387 --> 01:48:35,756
Abuk! You okay?
Come with us, quick. Run.

1277
01:48:35,825 --> 01:48:37,349
Run.

1278
01:48:38,694 --> 01:48:40,628
Wait. Wait!

1279
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:51,631
Be careful!
Abuk, be careful!

1280
01:48:51,707 --> 01:48:53,868
Here!

1281
01:48:59,148 --> 01:49:01,582
Hurry on up!
Where have you guys been?

1282
01:49:01,651 --> 01:49:03,812
Sorry about that, Jonah.

1283
01:49:03,886 --> 01:49:08,152
- I'm sorry. I can't take the girl.
- I'm not leaving her.

1284
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:11,250
- We're only allowed to evacuate aid workers.
- Well, to hell with whas allowed.

1285
01:49:11,327 --> 01:49:14,558
I'll— How much do you want for her?

1286
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:18,157
- Look, there's $800.
- Don't embarrass me.

1287
01:49:18,234 --> 01:49:21,169
You can't buy this. The rules
are made for good reason, please.

1288
01:49:21,237 --> 01:49:24,001
This is a chilïs life!
There are no rules to cover that!

1289
01:49:24,073 --> 01:49:26,405
Look, there are thousands
of them out there.

1290
01:49:26,476 --> 01:49:28,808
I can't make an exception
for this one child.

1291
01:49:28,878 --> 01:49:32,814
Yes, but this is one we can help! Here.

1292
01:49:32,882 --> 01:49:37,478
Abuk! Abuk! Abuk!

1293
01:49:39,689 --> 01:49:43,386
Listen, thas the way it is here.

1294
01:49:43,459 --> 01:49:45,825
Keep your money.
Strap yourself in, and les go.

1295
01:49:58,441 --> 01:50:02,207
What— Whall happen to her?

1296
01:50:02,278 --> 01:50:05,941
She might make it to a refugee camp...
if she's lucky.

1297
01:50:34,977 --> 01:50:37,207
This is what you came for,
I believe.

1298
01:50:49,792 --> 01:50:54,889
Your wife would have made that tape public,
Mr. Quayle, with my voice on it.

1299
01:50:54,964 --> 01:50:57,159
That letter was my insurance policy.

1300
01:50:57,233 --> 01:51:00,566
But how did they know
where to find her?

1301
01:51:00,636 --> 01:51:05,096
They were on their way to Marsabit,
taking the whole rotten package
to Grace Makanga.

1302
01:51:05,174 --> 01:51:07,165
Makanga would have put it
in front of the U. N.

1303
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:10,770
But someone knew exactly
where Tessa and Arnold would be.

1304
01:51:13,816 --> 01:51:15,784
That was me.

1305
01:51:15,851 --> 01:51:18,445
I radioed Nairobi.

1306
01:51:18,521 --> 01:51:21,684
KDH security man name of Crick.
God, Christ, man.

1307
01:51:21,757 --> 01:51:24,726
I didn't know they
were gonna be murdered.

1308
01:51:24,794 --> 01:51:27,194
My oath to God.

1309
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:32,258
Crick's going to know
that you were up here.

1310
01:51:32,335 --> 01:51:35,202
Going to be very interested
to know where you're headed.

1311
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:37,933
What do I tell him?

1312
01:51:39,508 --> 01:51:41,806
He'll know.

1313
01:51:41,877 --> 01:51:44,675
He's been there before.

1314
01:51:46,215 --> 01:51:48,149
Mr. Andika?
Yeah?

1315
01:51:48,217 --> 01:51:52,051
I'd like to apologize
if I embarrassed you earlier.

1316
01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:54,316
Is all right.

1317
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:59,054
Do you think that it would be possible
to land the plane here?

1318
01:51:59,128 --> 01:52:02,928
Lake Turkana? Is possible,
but you don't wanna go there.

1319
01:52:02,999 --> 01:52:05,229
Is—There's nothing there
but crocodiles.

1320
01:52:05,301 --> 01:52:07,565
Let me take you back to Loki.

1321
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:09,867
Well, l— I wouldn't be alone for long.

1322
01:52:09,939 --> 01:52:13,340
Please. I'd be, um— I'd be grateful.

1323
01:52:15,044 --> 01:52:17,342
I have one more favor
to ask you, I'm sorry.

1324
01:52:17,413 --> 01:52:20,246
Do you think you could post
that envelope for me?
Is quite urgent.

1325
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:22,011
Ah, Rome.

1326
01:53:48,771 --> 01:53:52,935
If we have lost in Justin and Tessa...

1327
01:53:53,008 --> 01:53:55,533
Two valued friends,

1328
01:53:55,611 --> 01:54:00,947
The diplomatic community
has lost a true gentleman—

1329
01:54:01,016 --> 01:54:04,008
Courteous, self-effacing,

1330
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:08,684
Large of heart.

1331
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:13,991
That he chose to take his own life
in the same remote spot...

1332
01:54:14,063 --> 01:54:17,692
Where Tessa met her tragic death...

1333
01:54:17,767 --> 01:54:21,897
Is a sad reflection
of his tormented state of mind...

1334
01:54:21,971 --> 01:54:25,839
But also typical of his discretion.

1335
01:54:27,543 --> 01:54:31,240
He would not have had us troubled.

1336
01:54:31,313 --> 01:54:35,773
He would not have had us inconvenienced.

1337
01:54:35,851 --> 01:54:39,981
Nothing in his life became him...

1338
01:54:40,055 --> 01:54:42,580
Like the leaving it.

1339
01:54:52,868 --> 01:54:58,272
I have, uh, chosen a text I know
Justin and Tessa would approve.

1340
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:02,003
Is an epistle.
Noncanonical.

1341
01:55:05,314 --> 01:55:10,513
"My Dear Sandy:
Your naiveté is beyond belief.

1342
01:55:10,586 --> 01:55:14,454
"Knowing our arrangements
with KDH and Three Bees,

1343
01:55:14,523 --> 01:55:16,855
"you send me
this half-baked report...

1344
01:55:16,926 --> 01:55:20,157
"by some bleeding heart
diplomatic wife and her black lover...

1345
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:22,561
"and ask me to take action.

1346
01:55:22,631 --> 01:55:26,795
"The only action required,
apart from shredding the thing,

1347
01:55:26,869 --> 01:55:30,566
"is to keep a tighter rein
on your resident harlot.

1348
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:35,941
"I want to know what she does,
where she goes, whom she meets.

1349
01:55:36,011 --> 01:55:39,242
"The issue here is deniability.

1350
01:55:39,315 --> 01:55:42,478
"If nobody told us
Dypraxa was causing deaths,

1351
01:55:42,551 --> 01:55:44,849
"we can't be held responsible.

1352
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:48,253
"But, my dear Sandy,
should it ever become known...

1353
01:55:48,324 --> 01:55:50,485
"that we've closed our eyes to the deaths,

1354
01:55:50,559 --> 01:55:53,460
"none of us would survive the scandal.

1355
01:55:53,529 --> 01:55:56,464
"I still have great hopes of you.
My love to Gloria.

1356
01:55:56,532 --> 01:55:59,763
Yours Sincerely, Bernard."

1357
01:55:59,835 --> 01:56:04,101
This way, sir.
What do you have to say, sir?

1358
01:56:10,679 --> 01:56:13,978
It was a bizarre sort of suicide.

1359
01:56:15,384 --> 01:56:19,411
His body bore no fewer
than eight bullet wounds...

1360
01:56:19,488 --> 01:56:21,422
From three different guns,

1361
01:56:21,490 --> 01:56:24,391
None of which was the one
found in his hand.

1362
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,428
So who has got away with murder?

1363
01:56:27,963 --> 01:56:30,932
Not, of course, the British government.

1364
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:35,528
They merely covered up,
as one does, the offensive corpses.

1365
01:56:35,604 --> 01:56:40,701
Though not literally. That was done
by person or persons unknown.

1366
01:56:42,344 --> 01:56:45,507
So who has committed murder?

1367
01:56:45,581 --> 01:56:50,644
Not, of course, the highly respectable firm
of KDH Pharmaceutical,

1368
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:54,655
Which has enjoyed
record profits this quarter...

1369
01:56:54,723 --> 01:56:57,988
And has now licensed ZimbaMed of Harare...

1370
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:02,053
To continue testing Dypraxa in Africa.

1371
01:57:03,299 --> 01:57:06,860
No, there are no murders in Africa.

1372
01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:09,666
Only regrettable deaths.

1373
01:57:09,738 --> 01:57:14,869
And from those deaths
we derive the benefits of civilization,

1374
01:57:14,944 --> 01:57:18,107
Benefits we can afford so easily...

1375
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:21,911
Because those lives
were bought so cheaply.

1376
01:57:53,349 --> 01:57:56,443
I know all your secrets, Tess.

1377
01:57:59,288 --> 01:58:01,848
I think I understand you now.

1378
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,851
You want me to come home.

1379
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,500
But I am home.

1380
01:59:15,564 --> 01:59:17,623
Mr. Quayle.

1381
01:59:26,241 --> 01:59:28,038
Tess.
