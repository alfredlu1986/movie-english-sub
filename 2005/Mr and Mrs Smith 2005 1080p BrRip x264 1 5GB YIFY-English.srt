1
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,115
OK, I'll go first.

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,554
Let me say, we don't really need to be here.

3
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,797
- See, we've been married five years.
- Six.

4
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,596
Five, six years.
And this is like a check-up for us.

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,310
Chance to poke around the engine,
maybe change the oil.

6
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,319
- Replace a seal or two.
- Yeah, that's it.

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,510
Very well, then. Let's pop the hood.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,709
On a scale of one to ten,
how happy a couple are you?

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,990
- Eight.
- Wait.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,318
Ten being perfectly happy
and one being totally miserable, or...

11
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,432
- Just respond instinctively.
- OK.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,793
Ready?

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,148
Eight.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,634
How often do you have sex?

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,558
I don't understand the question.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,478
Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a one to ten thing?

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,513
But, because, is, like, one very little,
or is one nothing? Because...

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,872
You know, technically speaking,
the zero would be nothing.

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,955
How about this week?

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,834
- Including the weekend?
- Sure.

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,195
Describe how you first met.

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,074
- It was in Colombia.
- Bogotá.

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,191
Five years ago.

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,833
Six.

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,155
Right. Five or six years ago.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,196
...todas las habitaciones.

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,633
Hey. ¿ Qué pasa?

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,991
Vamos, muchachos.
Registren los elevadores y los escalones.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,998
¿Anda solo?

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,152
Papeles.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,633
Señora.

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,996
- ¿Está sola?
- No.

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,440
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Está bien.

34
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,199
She's with me. Está bien.

35
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,874
Abren. Sus papeles.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,070
I'm Jane.

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,469
- John.
- Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,795
Nice to meet you.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,278
- To dodging bullets.
- Dodging bullets.

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,795
So it speaks.

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,070
But does it dance?

42
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,150
Hiya, stranger.

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,510
Hiya back.

44
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,110
I think room service fled.

45
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,708
I did what I could.

46
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,035
Thank you.

47
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,070
Oh, that's good.

48
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,317
I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it.

49
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,395
Hey, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen. Try your luck.

50
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,036
How about you, little lady?
Wanna try your luck? Win a prize?

51
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,390
Yeah, all right.

52
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,797
- Two.
- We got two over here.

53
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,757
- You know how to hold it?
- Step right up, have a shot.

54
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

55
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,797
Yeah.

56
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,355
- You gotta aim it.
- I am.

57
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,550
Don't laugh, I'll kill you.

58
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,109
You didn't blink.

59
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,789
Do we still get something?

60
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,070
Beginner's luck.

61
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,992
- I want to go again.
- Going again.

62
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,078
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

63
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,350
Beginner's luck.

64
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,392
Stop. Stop,
you've only known the girl for six weeks.

65
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,193
I'm in love. She's smart, sexy.

66
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,357
She's uninhibited, spontaneous, complicated.
She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,358
I knew Gladys two and a half years
before I asked her to marry me.

68
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,157
You have to have a foundation of friendship,
brother. The other stuff fades.

69
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,235
Hi.

70
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,676
So you don't think
this is all happening a little fast?

71
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,633
You know I never do anything
without thinking it through.

72
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,993
- What does he do?
- He's in construction. Big-time contractor.

73
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,433
A server goes down on Wall Street.
She's there, anytime, day or night.

74
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,270
She's like Batman for computers.

75
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,029
He's gone as much as I am, so it's perfect.

76
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,034
I give the whole thing six months, tops.

77
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,878
Eddie?

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,116
I asked her to marry me.

79
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,992
What?

80
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,556
- I'm getting married!
- What? I can't hear you.

81
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,678
- Getting married.
- I can't hear.

82
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,031
- Stop hitting him, he said something crazy.
- I'm getting married.

83
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,396
- Gotta get these filters changed.
- What did you think of Dr Wexler?

84
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,988
His questions were a bit wishy-washy.

85
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,749
Yeah. Watch your arm.
Not the most insightful.

86
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,876
And his office is clear across town.

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,233
Well, you know the four o'clock means
we hit rush hour. Not crazy about that.

88
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,794
- So that's settled then, yeah?
- OK.

89
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,955
OK.

90
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,991
Dinner's at seven.

91
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,315
Yup. I'll be there. Here.

92
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,517
Anybody calls,
I'm in with the boss. OK?

93
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,633
Got a call from the man. Big highline
assignment, Steve. You know how it is.

94
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,910
Actually, you probably don't.
Sweetie?

95
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,510
Could you grab me a coffee?
I like it with lots of sugar. Thanks a lot.

96
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,835
Hey there.

97
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,190
And where do you think you're going?

98
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,869
Well, I was... The boss wants to see me.

99
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,911
Well, he sees you.

100
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,270
Look, kid, people who've been
working here for 25 years

101
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,550
have never seen inside of that elevator.

102
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,477
Here.

103
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,516
This is the assignment?

104
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,870
Now get outta here.

105
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,436
- Hey, babe.
- Perfect timing.

106
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,755
It's pissing rain out there.

107
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,514
Gardener left the lawnmower out.

108
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,871
- How was work?
- Ah, so-so.

109
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,070
Oh, I got new curtains.

110
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,918
Did you?

111
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,634
Well?

112
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,875
What do you think?

113
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,631
There was a struggle over the material.
This tea sandwich of a man,

114
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,637
he got his hands on them first.

115
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,637
- But I won.
- Of course you did.

116
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,231
They're a bit green, so we have to reupholster
the sofas and get a new rug. Maybe a Persian.

117
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,354
Yeah, or we can just keep the old ones,
then we don't have to change a thing.

118
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,233
We talked about this. You remember?

119
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,796
I remember.
I remember cos we said we'd wait.

120
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,157
If you don't like 'em, we can take 'em back.

121
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,238
OK. I don't like 'em.

122
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,318
You'll get used to 'em.

123
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,714
Yeah.

124
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,558
Zero per cent APR till March.

125
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,470
So, part two. Here we are.

126
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,672
Only this time, you came back alone.
Why did you come back?

127
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,950
I'm not sure, really.

128
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,110
Let me clarify, I love my wife.

129
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,790
I want her to be happy.

130
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,115
I want good things for her.

131
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,555
But there are times...

132
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,118
- Honey, would you just...
- Five more minutes.

133
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,279
There's this huge space between us.

134
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,838
And itjust keeps filling up with
everything that we don't say to each other.

135
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,918
- What is that called?
- Marriage.

136
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,388
What don't you say to each other?

137
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,158
James of the Yukon got three stars.

138
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,952
This looks nice.
Did you do something new?

139
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,751
Yeah?

140
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,316
- I added peas.
- Yeah, peas.

141
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,438
Yeah, it's the green.

142
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,150
Sweetheart, will you pass the salt?

143
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,794
It's in the middle of the table.

144
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,914
- Is that the middle of the table?
- Yeah, it's between you and me.

145
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,512
- How honest are you with him?
- Pretty honest.

146
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,993
I mean...

147
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,999
It's not like I lie to him or anything.
We just...

148
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,715
I have little secrets.
Everybody has secrets.

149
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,958
Jesus! Honey, you scared me.

150
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,197
I'm sorry, hon. I was looking for the...

151
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,111
You going out?

152
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,030
Yes. Some clown crashed a server in a law
firm downtown and ended the world, so yes.

153
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,594
We promised the Colemans.

154
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,073
- I know.
- OK.

155
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,556
I'll be there. In and out. Just a quickie.

156
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,876
Probably feels like
you're the only people going through this,

157
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,028
but there are millions of couples
that are experiencing the same problems.

158
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,591
- We got a plane in an hour.
- All right.

159
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,633
- Who's Al Gore? "Quotes", 800.
- Prodded about possible insider trading,

160
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,038
she remarked on national television,
"I want to focus on my salad." Ryan?

161
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,037
- Martha Stewart.
- Martha Stewart?

162
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,596
- "Quotes" for 1000.
- Regarding Mick Jagger's knighthood,

163
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,191
he scoffed, "It's a paltry honour, mate.
Hold out for the lordship."

164
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,313
- 40.
- All right. I'll match you...

165
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,000
What the hell?
What's this shite?

166
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,671
Sorry. Where's the can around here?
Chrissake...

167
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,995
Take a... Hey, you guys playing poker?

168
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,829
- Private game. Piss off.
- Could I sit in? You think I could...

169
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,349
What part of "piss off"
do you not understand?

170
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,313
Guys... Whoa, be a little friendly.
I got the cash...

171
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,431
Easy, big feller.

172
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,799
That's cool, man. You're cool.

173
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,673
Lis... Look, see?
You see what I'm saying?

174
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,429
See what I'm saying?
Anyone interested?

175
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,519
Nah. Cos I'll clean you out.
I understand. Fine.

176
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,956
Listen, I want...
Those are really nice shoes, man.

177
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,032
Jesus!

178
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,596
- Here's an empty chair. I could sit here...
- That is Lucky's chair.

179
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,029
Where's Lucky? I don't see Lucky.

180
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,391
- Lucky's not back yet.
- Then I'll sit here.

181
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,511
Unless...

182
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,551
I'm too hot for you.

183
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,478
- Solid silver.
- Ooh, very sweet.

184
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,030
"To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."

185
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,310
In the pot. Put it in the pot.

186
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,514
Oh, he's pulled something.

187
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,914
You're in trouble now.

188
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,430
- $60, eh?
- In.

189
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,514
Look at the big man over there!

190
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,835
Let's play some poker!

191
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,074
- Fives.
- He's got 14 different tells!

192
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,270
You are bleeding William Tell.

193
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,273
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Lucky.

194
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,675
You're done, pal.
Thanks for the memories.

195
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,916
Oh, you Lucky? No kidding.

196
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,508
What is it, kid?
You looking for ajob or something?

197
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,551
You are the job.

198
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,670
Pair of threes.

199
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,590
- Have you been a bad boy?
- Yes.

200
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,592
You know what happens to bad boys?

201
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,390
- They get punished.
- Ooh, yeah. Punish me.

202
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,352
Have you been selling
big guns to bad people?

203
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,996
Mister Racin?

204
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,075
Mister Racin? You OK?

205
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,870
Oh, the Colemans.

206
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,279
He's down!

207
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,275
Taxi?

208
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,510
- Hey, hon.
- Hey, baby. I didn't hear you downstairs.

209
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,871
Yeah, I went to the sports bar.
Put some money on the game.

210
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,560
Yeah? How'd you do?

211
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,875
I got lucky.

212
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,154
Welcome, neighbours!

213
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,589
- Hi, Susan.
- Good to see you, John.

214
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,836
- There you go.
- Oh, this is wonderful.

215
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,599
Thank you.

216
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,429
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you very much. So is yours.

217
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,910
- Come on, let's go see the girls.
- Don't stray too far, guys.

218
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,917
You want a Cuban?

219
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,270
No, I don't smoke.

220
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,233
- Clean body, clean soul, Suzy says.
- Ain't that the truth.

221
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,715
- You guys have any vices?
- Well, you know.

222
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,310
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes. Chardonnay, please.

223
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,518
- Girls?
- Chardonnay.

224
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,111
- Daddy!
- I'll be up here at the filling station.

225
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,629
...stock's getting butchered.
- Hey, boys. Scotch?

226
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,990
- Yes, sir.
- It's a bloodbath over there.

227
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,350
How'd you make out last quarter?
Take a beating?

228
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,439
Actually, I got all my dough
buried under the tool shed.

229
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,872
- So, Chuck got the promotion.
- Oh, my God, that is so great.

230
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,878
So excited. We can finally
put the addition on the kitchen.

231
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,560
Oh, shoot. Not again.

232
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,194
Shoulda worn a raincoat.

233
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,551
You know what? Would...
Can you hold her for a second?

234
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,035
- What? No...
- It's all over the appliqué.

235
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,549
- Oh, no, I...
- No, please, just...

236
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,830
Sure.

237
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,915
Seltzer.

238
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,793
Aw, she likes you.

239
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,318
I liked your dress tonight.

240
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,635
It was nice.

241
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,955
Thank you.

242
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,670
Good morning, Mr Smith.
There's trouble in Atlanta again.

243
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,112
- That's what I hear. What you got?
- I've got your boarding pass, taxi receipts...

244
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,435
Get rid of that gum.

245
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,438
- You got a tissue?
- And your hotel bill.

246
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,438
- Thanks.
- Don't lose those. Keep them in the envelope.

247
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,437
We've got the new specs for the dam.

248
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,915
- Great, Louie. I'll check those out.
- Here.

249
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,794
- Is Eddie here?
- The door's unlocked.

250
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,150
- Morning, pal.
- How you doing?

251
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,919
Same old same old.
People need killing.

252
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,553
Oh, Johnny.

253
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,274
Little get-together this weekend at my house.

254
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,915
Barbecue, no ladies, dudes only.
It's gonna be awesome.

255
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,235
Yeah, I'll talk to the missus.

256
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,920
You want to use my cellphone?
Maybe give her a call,

257
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,157
in case you decide to scratch your ass
or use the head later.

258
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,989
- Make sure she thinks it's OK.
- You live with your mother.

259
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,918
Why bring her into this?
She's a first-class lady.

260
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,556
And I don't have to check in with her when I
want to do something. She cooks, she cleans.

261
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,478
She makes me snacks.
I'm the dumb guy?

262
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,477
John Smith.

263
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,157
- Hello, John.
- Morning, Atlanta.

264
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,308
Quite the body count this week. We have
a priority one, so I need your expertise.

265
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,991
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
aka "The Tank".

266
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,399
He's a direct threat to the firm.
DIA custody.

267
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,799
They're making a ground-to-air handoff
to heli, ten miles north of the Mexican border.

268
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,515
I need you to make sure
the target does not change hands.

269
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,834
"The Tank"?

270
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,913
- l-Temp technology...
- Jane Smith confirmed.

271
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,235
Stand by for contact.

272
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,635
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation.

273
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,231
You know the competition would love to see
us burn. I need you to handle this personally.

274
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,351
- Target?
- Benjamin Danz.

275
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,837
I'm rolling the specs now.
We need this quick, clean, and contained.

276
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,995
Yes, sir.

277
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,878
- Ladies.
- Morning.

278
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,638
- Morning.
- Hello, Jane.

279
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,512
Yesterday's op: one kill,
one agent in protective custody.

280
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,029
- We'll get him out tomorrow.
- Two cases of G-40s.

281
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,355
- The grenade launchers are here.
- Order more.

282
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,550
All right. Go, Jas.

283
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,558
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
aka "The Tank".

284
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,511
- You serious?
- Yeah.

285
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,359
He's being moved across the border
to a federal facility.

286
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,234
The only point of vulnerability
is just south of the border.

287
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,558
I want GPS and SAC of the canyon,
and the weather report for the last three days.

288
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,591
He'll rendezvous with the helicopter at a
deserted airstrip. We've one chance to strike.

289
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,470
Oh, look. More desert.

290
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,115
- Are we green?
- Perimeter is armed. We are up and running.

291
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,869
Red team, red team, this is Broadway Joe.
Half-time is approaching.

292
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,195
Copy that, Broadway Joe.

293
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,515
Oh, come on...

294
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,393
- You getting this?
- Affirmative. Is it a threat?

295
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,992
Countdown's initiated.
The convoy is not in the zone yet.

296
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,588
An idiot's in the field.
He'll blow the charges.

297
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,031
OK.

298
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,755
You gotta be kidding me.

299
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,678
Civilians.

300
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,275
Let's get a tune out of this trombone.

301
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,796
Picking up a weapon signature.

302
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,070
Shit. Not a civilian.

303
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,950
Aw, man...

304
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,990
Asshole.

305
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,836
Countdown is initiated.

306
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,955
You should so not be allowed
to buy these things.

307
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,549
Abort!

308
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,472
I think I got ID'd on that hit.
You ever been ID'd on a hit?

309
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,592
- Not that I'm aware of, no.
- Right. I'm in trouble.

310
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,350
- You get a look at him?
- Little thing. Buck ten, buck fifteen tops.

311
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,994
Maybe he's Filipino.

312
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,315
I'm not even sure it was a him.

313
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,872
You saying that you had
your ass handed to you by some girl?

314
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,468
I think so. A pro.

315
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,438
Well, it shouldn't be that difficult. I mean,
how many chicks are hitters out there?

316
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,313
- You guys want any dessert?
- What do you have, honey?

317
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,432
- Ice cream.
- Delicious. What flavours?

318
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,120
- Chocolate and vanilla.
- I don't like those.

319
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,676
But mixed together,
that could be nice, you know what I mean?

320
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,349
And notjust the little pink spoon,
I like the whole sundae.

321
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,391
- That could be arranged.
- Perfect.

322
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,116
"Could be arranged." You hear that? I'd like
to have her kick my ass, know what I mean?

323
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,755
- Any other details besides her weight class?
- Laptop.

324
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,916
Sorry? You're in a whole zone right now...

325
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,758
- Laptop.
- OK, laptop.

326
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,839
I want to know who that bitch is.
Get me that tape.

327
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,520
- Jane.
- Get me that tape.

328
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,835
- What?
- It's Father.

329
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,551
The FBI secured the package.
The window's closed, sir.

330
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,070
- I told you we couldn't afford mistakes.
- There was another player.

331
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,594
We do not leave witnesses.
If this player ID'd you... You know the rules.

332
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,518
You have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane.

333
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,835
Looking forward to it, sir.

334
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,468
All right, we have a new target.
Let's find out who he is.

335
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,796
Jesus... What did you do to it?

336
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,708
Put a campfire out with it?

337
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,910
Buy a new one.

338
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,316
This one has sentimental value for its owner.

339
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,638
- Who's that?
- Well, Gwen, I'm just hoping you can tell me.

340
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,590
So, why you gotta know so bad, anyway?

341
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,194
You know, just trying
to return some lost property.

342
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,073
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, John.

343
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,395
- You a vegan?
- No.

344
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,556
My girlfriend is.

345
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,475
Here we go.

346
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,512
Upgraded RAM module.

347
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,551
Chip's Chinese.

348
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,310
Imported by Dynamix. Retailed by...

349
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,551
You know, I might be able
to get you a billing address.

350
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,319
All right? No name, just an address.

351
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,718
570 Lexington Avenue, Suite 5003.

352
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,796
New York.

353
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,115
You know the place?

354
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,795
Sweet Jesus! Mother of God...

355
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,232
Why don't you both go make some coffee?

356
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,640
Jane, it's your husband.

357
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,595
He's back from Atlanta
and he wants to know about dinner.

358
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,598
Tell him... Dinner's at seven.

359
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,829
Hi, John.
Yeah, she says dinner's at seven.

360
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,155
It always is.

361
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,311
Perfect timing.

362
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,079
As always.

363
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,958
- This is a nice surprise.
- I hope so.

364
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,958
- You're home early.
- I missed you.

365
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,275
I missed you, too.

366
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,755
- Shall we?
- Yes.

367
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,035
- Thought these were for special occasions.
- This is a special occasion.

368
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,359
Pot roast. My favourite.

369
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,709
Allow me, sweetheart.

370
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,990
Been on your feet all day.

371
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,111
Thank you.

372
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,435
Sure.

373
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,319
So how's work?

374
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,836
Actually, we had a little trouble
with a commission.

375
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,871
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

376
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,236
Double booking with another firm.

377
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,874
- Green beans?
- No, thank you.

378
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,195
You'll have some.

379
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,076
Well, I hope everything worked out OK.

380
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,111
It hasn't yet.

381
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,959
But it will.

382
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,389
Pot roast is my favourite.

383
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,273
Sweetheart, could you pass the salt?

384
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,915
Tried something new?

385
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,311
How was Atlanta?

386
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,796
Had a few problems ourselves.
Some figures didn't add up.

387
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,559
- Big deal?
- Life or death. Wine?

388
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,870
- I got it.
- I'll get a towel.

389
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,397
Janie?

390
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,796
Honey?

391
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,277
Jane!

392
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,232
Jane!

393
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,311
How could I be so stupid?

394
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,319
Jane!

395
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,317
Jane!

396
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,195
Oh, dear God...

397
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,034
Wait. No, no. Accident.

398
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,276
Honey? Accident.

399
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,073
Jane, stop the car, now.

400
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,030
Jane?

401
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,037
You're overreacting.

402
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,196
Let's not get carried away.

403
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,914
We don't want to go to sleep angry.
We can talk this out.

404
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,155
God!

405
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,918
Pull over.

406
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,508
Pull over! Pull over!

407
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,511
Now, look...

408
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,515
We need to talk!

409
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,599
- OK, I'm coming. Who is it?
- Open up.

410
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,792
- What the hell happened to you?
- My wife.

411
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,234
- She tried to kill me.
- Yes. And you know what?

412
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,512
Gladys tried to kill me. Not with a car.
At least Jane was a man about it.

413
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,839
But they all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully,
cripplingly. And then, wham! They hurt you.

414
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,316
You know how hurt I used to be?
I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great.

415
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,637
I got dates all the time.
I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe.

416
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,716
- You live with your mom.
- I choose to.

417
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,549
Because that's the only woman
I've ever trusted.

418
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,990
- It's unbelievable.
- Look, I know exactly what you're thinking.

419
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,998
If she lied about that,
what else has she lied about?

420
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,157
I mean, herjob is a spy,
to get information from people.

421
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,956
French Riviera. A yacht. An Iranian prince.

422
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,392
She's supposed to get close to him
and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

423
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,476
What? What are you saying?

424
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,354
What? Your husband is the shooter?

425
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,675
That's impossible.

426
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,075
Really?

427
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,079
This was probably planned from
the beginning. Operation Stakeout Johnny.

428
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,796
A six-year stakeout to get information
from you. Mission accomplished.

429
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,633
OK.

430
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,756
Here's the upside.

431
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,757
- You don't love him.
- No.

432
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,112
You'll kill him, and nobody's
better at that than you are.

433
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,516
- Thank you.
- And then it'll be over.

434
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,029
Lookit, I know you're embarrassed,
but it's Eddie you're talking to.

435
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,311
The guys we work with,
they don't know, I'm never gonna tell 'em.

436
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,070
The people she works with probably got
a big laugh over this, but that's not important.

437
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,749
Lookit, it's like 150 pages
of a book have been written.

438
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,429
In the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown.

439
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,999
Well, you can write the last ten pages. You
been smoked, but you can write the last ten.

440
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,829
Great talk, man. We should do it more often.
It was great, I'm proud of you.

441
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,997
- I'm gonna borrow this.
- I like where your head's at, man.

442
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,997
- I'll do it in the morning.
- Yeah.

443
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,748
- You OK?
- Yeah.

444
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,440
- OK. Good night.
- Night.

445
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,071
You don't love him.

446
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,998
- Night, Johnny.
- Night, Eddie.

447
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,315
Good night, Mom.

448
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,918
OK, girls. Let's go.

449
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,555
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.
You know the drill.

450
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,071
This is nice. Who picked this out?

451
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,068
- What is this?
- It looks like your wedding.

452
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,510
- I know what it is. What are you doing?
- Research on the target.

453
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,870
This room is wrapped. Thank you.

454
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,876
...to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish, till death do us part.

455
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,434
I promise.

456
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,554
I, John, take you, Jane, to be my lawfully
wedded wife, to have and to h...

457
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,195
What's going on, Mrs Smith?

458
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,513
Garden party, girls.

459
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,879
Howdy, neighbour.

460
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,352
Wow. I can't believe I've never
been in here before. This is great.

461
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,711
- Start with the living room.
- Oh, yeah.

462
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,755
- I love the floors. What are they, teak?
- Red oak, Martin. Red oak.

463
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,310
And you won the Golf Masters trophy
this year.

464
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,750
- Again.
- Again. That'll be on your mantel next year.

465
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,194
Bitch.

466
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,434
Target profile is our main priority.

467
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,351
Utilise all means necessary.

468
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,393
Phone taps. Credit cards.
Audio scan civilian frequencies.

469
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,715
With what, Jane?

470
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,792
You've reached the Smiths.
We can't take your call,

471
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,151
but leave a message after the tone
and we'll get back to you.

472
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,353
- And search the database.
- For what? John Smith?

473
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,510
- Find him.
- Jane?

474
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,119
What?

475
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,629
- I think I found him.
- Where?

476
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,955
Here.

477
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,388
Heat sensor breach in the perimeter.

478
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,796
Commence scanning all floors.

479
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,028
I told you not to bother me
at the office, honey.

480
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,757
- Well, you are still Mrs Smith.
- Well, so are a lot of girls.

481
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,394
Careful. I can push the button
any time, anywhere.

482
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,830
Baby, you couldn't find the button
with both hands and a map.

483
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,798
Last warning. You need to disappear.

484
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,035
- No.
- Now.

485
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,559
D sector clear.

486
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,753
- You expect me to roll over and play dead?
- Should be used to it after five years.

487
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,112
- Six. And I'm not leaving.
- E sector clear.

488
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,112
Anywhere, any time.

489
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,830
Intruder detected.

490
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,078
- Evacuate plan C.
- Evacuation in progress.

491
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,719
Evacuation in progress.

492
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,471
Evacuation in progress.

493
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,350
Evacuation in progress.

494
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,918
Chickenshit!

495
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,673
Pussy!

496
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,440
You tell me you had a shot at her
and you didn't take it?

497
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,271
We got all this stuff here, and you're trying
to tell me you couldn't take her out?

498
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,474
Well, now she's a problem for both of us.
Now my house is priority one.

499
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,837
Just gimme a hand, will you?

500
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,953
You're driving me crazy with the tongs
and the furnace. You're like an insane man.

501
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,595
All right, they gave you 48 hours.
What we got left here?

502
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,030
- 23? 22?
- 18 and change.

503
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,277
- 18 hours until they close the book on you?
- Eddie?

504
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,871
Mom, we're on high alert here!
I almost killed you right then.

505
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,959
- You do not even realise!
- Never mind.

506
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,117
I am so done playing games with this broad.

507
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,550
- You gotta take her out head-on.
- Don't tell me how to handle my wife.

508
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,877
She's not your wife, she's the enemy.
She could be outside now!

509
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,752
Eddie.

510
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,996
Got it.

511
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,236
Now we're talking. Only question is,
how much is it to buy a vowel?

512
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,038
- Blackbow Realty.
- Hi, I'm from l-Temp.

513
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,515
Great!
How's our new penthouse working out?

514
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,518
Well, just fine, thank you for asking.

515
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,197
This is security.
There's a problem with your elevator, sir.

516
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,073
Do you want an engineer
to come see what the problem is?

517
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,998
Take your time, I'm really quite comfortable.

518
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,839
Are you really comfortable?

519
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,678
Jane?

520
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,189
Is that you, sweetheart?

521
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,232
First and last warning, John.
Get out of town.

522
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,275
You know I'm not going anywhere.

523
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,915
Well, so you say. But right now,
you're trapped in a steel box

524
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,395
hanging 70 floors over nothing but air.

525
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,910
- Oh, so this is a trap?
- He's in car three.

526
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,110
It's never gonna work, honey.

527
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,756
It's never gonna work,
because you constantly underestimate me.

528
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,758
- Do I?
- You have no idea who I am.

529
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,553
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

530
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,597
- Well, back at you, baby.
- Let me guess...

531
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,388
Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable,
two on the primary and secondary brakes?

532
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,919
Maybe?

533
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,474
- He found them.
- Yes, thank you.

534
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,798
Did you also get the base charge
on the principle cable?

535
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,752
Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it.

536
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,793
OK. I give up.

537
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,679
Blow it.

538
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,110
- What?
- Go on, blow it.

539
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,119
- You think I won't?
- I think you won't.

540
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,475
OK.

541
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,034
Five, four...

542
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,717
- Any last words?
- The new curtains are hideous.

543
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,829
Goodbye, John.

544
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,556
- What the hell was that?
- What? You said goodbye.

545
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,515
The gas! Cut off the gas!

546
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,797
Jane?

547
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,879
Madame.

548
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,197
Thought of a number of lines
for this moment.

549
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,996
"Thought I'd just drop in."
"Hey, doll, thanks for giving me the shaft."

550
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,590
Nice. So what did you decide?

551
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,476
I want a divorce.

552
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,669
I like it. You proposed to me here,
so it has agreeable symmetry.

553
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,995
Coat, sir?

554
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,475
- May I sit?
- No.

555
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,113
- Champagne?
- No, champagne's for celebrating.

556
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,232
- I'll have a martini.
- I'm fine, thank you.

557
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,118
So what do you want, John?

558
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,754
We have an unusual problem, Jane.

559
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,390
You obviously want me dead. And I'm
less and less concerned of your wellbeing.

560
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,636
So what do we do?

561
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,156
Do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best?

562
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,355
Well, that would be a shame, because they'd
probably ask me to leave once you're dead.

563
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,675
Dance with me.

564
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,916
- You don't dance.
- That was just part of my cover, sweetheart.

565
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,315
Was sloth part of it too?

566
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,791
Think this'll have a happy ending?

567
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,436
Happy endings are just
stories that haven't finished yet.

568
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,116
Satisfied?

569
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,549
Not for years.

570
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,355
It's all John, sweetheart.

571
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,116
Why is it you think we failed?
Cos we were leading separate lives?

572
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,310
Or was it all the lying that did us in?

573
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,398
I have a theory. Newly formed.

574
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,273
- I'm breathless to hear it.
- You killed us.

575
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,595
Provocative.

576
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,991
You approached our marriage like ajob,
to be reconned, planned and executed.

577
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,190
And you avoided it.

578
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,754
What do you care, if I was just a cover?

579
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,917
Well, who said you were just a cover?

580
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,713
- Wasn't I?
- Wasn't I?

581
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,710
I have to... Excuse me.

582
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,715
No exits up there, Jane.

583
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,353
Be cold, John. She's a liar.

584
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,198
Be super cold.

585
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,595
Come on, madam, this way.

586
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,793
Do you know that you're ticking?

587
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,589
Get back!

588
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,630
Limo, sir?

589
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,875
Jane Smith.

590
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,875
- That's the second time you tried to kill me.
- It was just a little bomb.

591
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,912
I'm going home to burn
everything I ever bought you.

592
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,600
I'll race you there, baby.

593
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,278
You there yet?

594
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,631
First time we met,
what was your first thought?

595
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,071
You tell me.

596
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,350
I thought...

597
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,198
I thought you looked like Christmas morning.

598
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,839
I don't know how else to say it.

599
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,428
And why are you telling me this now?

600
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,638
Guess in the end
you start thinking about the beginning.

601
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,517
So there it is.
I thought you should know.

602
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,119
So how about it, Jane? Hm?

603
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,550
I thought...

604
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,950
I thought that you were
the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.

605
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,589
- So it was all business, yeah?
- All business.

606
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,915
- From the go.
- Cold, hard math.

607
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,517
Thank you.
That's what I needed to know.

608
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,836
OK.

609
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,597
Hey, John.

610
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,835
Hey, Bill.

611
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,869
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

612
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,877
OK.

613
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:06,235
Uh, by the way, John, your car
is hanging out over the sidewalk here.

614
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,828
- Yeah, thanks, Bill.
- OK. Have a good night.

615
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,712
Good night.

616
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,717
Shit.

617
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,035
Shit.

618
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,632
You still alive, baby?

619
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,475
Your aim's as bad as your cooking,
sweetheart.

620
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,595
And that's saying something.

621
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,914
Come on, honey.

622
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,634
Come to Daddy.

623
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,955
Who's your daddy now?

624
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,395
Can't do it.

625
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,793
Don't! Come on.

626
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,480
Come on!

627
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,636
You want it?

628
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,671
It's yours.

629
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,953
Hi, stranger.

630
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,275
Hiya back.

631
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,515
- Yeah?
- Everything OK? We heard an awful ruckus.

632
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,191
- No, everything's fine here. Yeah, it's great.
- So you guys are fine?

633
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,470
Yeah, couldn't be better.

634
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,637
Nice. You guys are...

635
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,671
- Suzy, Martin.
- Have a nice night.

636
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,078
Looks like you're redecorating, it's very...
Yeah. Shame about the red oak...

637
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,470
Five more minutes, Mom...

638
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,159
Tempting. But I don't get out of bed
for less than half a million dollars.

639
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,318
- That left of yours... A thing of beauty.
- You take it well.

640
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,556
Thank you.

641
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,195
That vacation in Aspen?

642
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,630
You left early. Why?

643
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,353
- Jean-Luc Gaspard.
- Oh, God!

644
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,516
- Yeah.
- I wanted him.

645
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,915
Forget it.

646
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,272
You didn't hear me that night the chopper
dropped me off for our anniversary dinner.

647
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,834
- No.
- No?

648
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,476
Percussion grenades.
I was partially deaf that night.

649
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,916
I'm slightly colour blind.

650
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,636
- Retinal scarring.
- I can't feel anything in these three fingers.

651
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,914
Three ribs. Broken eye socket.
Perforated eardrum.

652
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,832
You ever have trouble sleeping after?

653
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,435
- Nope.
- Yeah, me neither.

654
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,713
Go, go, go.
Look out.

655
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,112
Move it.

656
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,348
Shoes.

657
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,790
I was given 48 hours to take you out.

658
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,399
Same.

659
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,795
Jesus, where's the trust?

660
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,115
What do you expect?

661
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,594
Why do I get the girl gun?

662
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,788
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

663
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,755
We need a car.

664
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,559
Colemans.

665
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,274
Guy's had my barbecue set for months.

666
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,670
- I was never in the Peace Corps.
- What?

667
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,711
I really liked that about you.

668
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,435
Maybe this honesty thing
isn't such a good idea.

669
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,835
- I didn't go to MIT.
- Really?

670
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,952
Notre Dame. Art History major.

671
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,668
- Art?
- History.

672
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,189
- It's reputable.
- OK.

673
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,154
Fuckers get younger every year.

674
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,554
I have to tell you,
I never really liked your cooking.

675
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,516
It's not your gift.

676
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,632
Baby, I've never cooked a day in my life.

677
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,030
l-Temp girls cooked.

678
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,275
Web of lies!

679
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,990
I don't know how you do it

680
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,680
Making love

681
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,313
Out of nothing at all

682
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,317
Making love...

683
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,998
I like it. Deal with it.

684
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,755
- We got company.
- What?

685
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,630
Shit.

686
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:32,233
- Baby, hold steady now!
- It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.

687
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,151
Hold still.

688
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,511
This thing's all over the place.
How do you drive these things?

689
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,595
Honey!

690
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,276
- Honey, let me drive.
- I got it.

691
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,551
Move over. Move.

692
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,955
I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart.

693
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,230
- You move.
- Fine. Go.

694
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,436
- Go.
- Go.

695
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,150
They're bulletproof.

696
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,475
They're bulletproof!

697
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,998
I think I should probably tell you.

698
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,237
I was married once before.

699
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,197
- What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

700
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,029
- It was a drunken Vegas thing.
- That's better. That's much better. Great.

701
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,037
Stop it.

702
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,515
Go, go, go!

703
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,718
- Her name and social security number?
- No, you're not gonna kill her.

704
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,949
These doors are handy.

705
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,037
You know, sweetheart,
you're being a bit hypocritical.

706
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,357
It's not like you're some beacon of truth.

707
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,995
John, my parents...

708
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,674
They died when I was five.
I'm an orphan.

709
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,837
Who was that kindly fellow
who gave you away at our wedding?

710
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,076
Paid actor.

711
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,399
I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island.

712
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,272
I know.

713
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,277
I don't even want to talk about it.

714
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,316
- You got it?
- Got it.

715
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,196
- Any time.
- I got it.

716
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:20,515
We're gonna have to redo
every conversation we've ever had.

717
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,153
I'm Jewish.

718
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,313
Can't believe I brought
my real parents to our wedding.

719
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,631
Disgusting.
How could you serve this?

720
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:35,392
Ma'am, is it possible to get this reheated?
Miss? Miss, I'm talking to you. Excuse me?

721
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,317
Jesus, Johnny.

722
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,908
- Good morning, Eddie.
- Morning.

723
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,235
It's good to see you're OK.

724
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,752
Tell me you got smart
and that you killed that lying bitch.

725
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,314
This lying bitch?

726
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,829
Guess it was just wishful thinking.

727
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,075
- I'm sorry.
- Eddie.

728
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:58,159
- Nice to see you, Jane.
- Eddie. Eddie! Focus. We got problems.

729
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:02,193
Problems? Crack addicts got problems,
my friend. You two are smoked.

730
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,514
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

731
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,599
You got the entire agency gunning for you.
Probably her agency, too.

732
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:11,395
- And what about you? Where you at?
- Me? Where am I at?

733
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,875
I find myself dragging my feet this morning.

734
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,719
I think you owe me a little money, anyway.

735
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,355
- So what do...
- We don't understand each other.

736
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,472
But I don't need those looks, OK?
I been in his life a long time.

737
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,795
- Focus, Eddie, focus.
- A long time.

738
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,948
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house,
they shot at my wife. My own company.

739
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,390
If she works for
who the street says that she works for...

740
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:45,154
...you're Macy's and Gimbel's. Then she would
be the WE channel, and you would be...

741
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:49,068
Whatever channel competes against
the WE channel. Know what I'm saying?

742
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,875
The point is simple. Once you guys
get off the reservation, that's it.

743
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,798
- Then you're off the reservation.
- Eddie, how bad?

744
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,275
How bad is it?

745
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,516
You remember Canada.

746
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,155
- Kids' stuff next to this.
- That was you?

747
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,238
Is that a turn-on?
Didn't she try to kill you with a car?

748
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:09,238
A good friend stays out of it.
This is the facts.

749
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,718
If you two separate from each other, you got
a shot. Not a great shot, Johnny, but a shot.

750
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,435
You two stay together, you're dead.

751
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,997
Unless you can find something they want
more than they want you.

752
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:31,239
Found him. He's being held
in sub-basement D of the federal courthouse.

753
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,309
High security, motion and thermal.
Power's on the city grid.

754
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,032
This is as far as we go, Jane.

755
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,869
- Right. Thanks for everything.
- Good luck, baby.

756
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:52,078
...and this north-westerly blow coming
down from the middle of the country...

757
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,395
Do you guys mind changing the channel?

758
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,511
...one is moving in now...

759
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:01,839
Nick? Would you please get off
your fat ass and change the channel?

760
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:08,069
- I know it's tough. Thank you.
...tomorrow, that's going to make things...

761
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:37,277
30 second window. I cut the power,
you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it?

762
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,630
Got it.

763
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,194
Tell me, how many?

764
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,916
Does it matter?

765
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,554
- Should I go first?
- OK.

766
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,594
I don't exactly keep count, but...

767
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,596
I would say...

768
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,915
High 50s, low 60s.

769
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:02,037
I've been around the block,
but the important thing is...

770
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,196
312.

771
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,715
312?

772
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,909
- How?
- Some were two at a time.

773
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,874
- Honey?
- I'm...

774
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,430
- You monitoring the perimeter?
- I checked the perimeter.

775
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,313
- What about the police bands?
- I'm on the police bands.

776
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,476
- Connected...
- This is not my first time.

777
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,399
Think we've established that.

778
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,555
All right.

779
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,710
Turn left.

780
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,478
Left, John.

781
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,679
Left.

782
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:56,074
You don't need to talk to me like that.
OK? Be nice.

783
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,998
- Left, please.
- I can't go left.

784
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,430
See? There is no left. Look.

785
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,869
I have straight, or back the way I came.

786
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,070
There's no left.
Which way do you want?

787
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,351
- Just stay there and wait for my mark.
- See what I'm sitting in?

788
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,357
You see that?

789
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,555
- Take your time.
- Yeah, all right! Stay.

790
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,319
Stay there, wait for my mark. I'll find it.

791
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,116
Wait for my mark.

792
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:30,518
Almost there.
I don't know what happened. Just hold on.

793
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,512
John, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

794
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,234
Cut the lights on my signal.

795
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,509
Now. Kill the lights.

796
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,155
- Jane, kill the lights.
- What's that?

797
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,876
- Where?
- Turn 'em back on! Idiot!

798
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,396
- Here they come.
- Uncuff me.

799
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,715
Turn 'em back on.
Turn 'em back on!

800
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,230
- Turn 'em back on!
- All right!

801
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,798
- Give me the light!
- Shut up!

802
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,670
- Nick!
- Shut up.

803
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,597
Give me a gun.
Nick, give me a gun!

804
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,597
Zip it!

805
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,150
This guy's a wily one.

806
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,317
- You didn't wait for my signal.
- I improvised.

807
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,715
- You deviated from the plan.
- Plan was flawed.

808
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,230
- The plan was not flawed.
- Anal.

809
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,079
- Organised.
- Jane, 90 per cent of this job is instinct.

810
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:10,239
- Your instincts set off the alarms.
- And got the job done. Not The Jane Show...

811
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:14,239
No, it was The John Show. Half-assed.
Like Christmas, our anniversary,

812
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,158
the time you forgot to bring
my mother's birthday present.

813
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,717
- Your fake mother's birthday.
- You are always the first to break team.

814
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,593
You don't want a team,
you want a servant for hire.

815
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,393
I want someone I can count on.

816
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,036
- Jane, there's no air around you any more.
- OK, what is that supposed to mean?

817
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:36,597
It means there's no room for mistakes,
no mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity.

818
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,109
- Who can answer to that?
- Well, you don't have to.

819
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,913
Cos this isn't even a real marriage.

820
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,753
- Who are you people?
- Shut up!

821
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,550
OK. So, now I realise

822
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,593
you witnessed the missus and I
working through some domestic issues.

823
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,915
That's regrettable.

824
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,596
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.
That would be a mistake.

825
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,154
Now, tell us what you know.

826
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,078
Why do both our bosses want you dead?

827
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,598
You underst... Honey.

828
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,756
Please?

829
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,915
Wrap it up.

830
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:22,715
Maybe it's not a good idea
to undermine me in front of the hostage.

831
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,990
Sends a mixed message.

832
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,352
Sorry.

833
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,436
Girls.

834
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,354
OK. Where was I?

835
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,835
- A mistake on your part.
- Shut up. Options.

836
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,793
I'm gonna lay out your options for you, OK?
Option A...

837
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,150
- If I could...
- Shut up.

838
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,875
Option A. You talk, we listen, no pain.

839
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,309
Option B. You don't talk.

840
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,876
I remove your thumbs with my pliers.
It will hurt.

841
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,756
Option C.

842
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,839
I like to vary the details a bit,
but the punch line is, you die.

843
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,594
Benjamin?
We're impatient people, Benjamin.

844
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,910
Can I get a soda? Or ajuice, or some...

845
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,320
A, option A!

846
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,671
- Ow, that hurt!
- OK, that was a nice shot.

847
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,677
What's... You got a spasm?

848
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,349
I'm tied up.
Why don't you check my back pocket?

849
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,598
I'm not the target.
You are. Both of you.

850
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,276
They found out you're married, so they
teamed up and sent you to the same hit.

851
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,436
It was ajoint task force, both companies.

852
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,473
Two competing agents living under
the same roof? It's bad for business.

853
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,991
- They wanted you to take each other out.
- You were bait.

854
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,953
Well, it's entry level.
Toehold into the company.

855
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:05,595
Couple hits, they bump me up to a desk.
It's pretty cool, actually.

856
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,792
- You keep the photo in your pocket?
- Was I supposed to frame it?

857
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,832
You get rid of it. You burn it.
Tradecraft 101.

858
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,909
Guess I skipped that day. I guess you skipped
the day about not marrying the enemy.

859
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,190
You were bait or you are bait?

860
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,510
Belt! Belt, belt, dude.

861
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,915
Two minutes.

862
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,715
One minute.

863
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,038
- A little help?
- Clear.

864
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,310
Clear.

865
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,952
My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz.

866
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,758
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

867
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,348
So at least apart we know what the odds are.

868
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,155
Let's just call this what it is.

869
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,634
And what it isn't.

870
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,556
All right, so it's a crap marriage.

871
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,195
All right, I'm a mess, you're a disaster.

872
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,470
We're both liars.

873
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,798
But you run, you'll always be running.

874
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,314
I say we stay and fight.

875
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,273
We finish this thing.

876
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,470
Then if you want to go, you can go.

877
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,670
Well, thank you.

878
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,510
What? "Let's call this what it is."
Jesus Christ...

879
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,835
- Stop...
- Don't.

880
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,515
This is a really good store.

881
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,354
- See you in the next life, Jane.
- Likewise, John.

882
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,590
Sorry.

883
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,517
We'll talk about this later.

884
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,950
Jesus!

885
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,396
- I didn't touch a thing.
- Yes, you did.

886
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,153
- Sorry about the knife in the...
- I don't want to talk about it.

887
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,950
- I'll fly.
- I'll be bait.

888
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,878
I'm going clockwise. Watch my six.

889
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,477
Go! Move!

890
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,595
How's it look?

891
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,715
It's a piece of cake.

892
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,315
Watch these, they tend to jam.

893
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,635
So watch 'em.

894
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:50,718
You favour your left,
sweetheart, so I'll cover right.

895
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:07,754
Damn, that boat in La Paz is looking
pretty good right now, isn't it?

896
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:13,077
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

897
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,275
There's nowhere I'd rather be
than right here, with you.

898
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,677
Shut up.

899
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,868
I'm interested in the progress
you've made in the last few weeks.

900
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,835
Doing all right, aren't we? I'm not gonna lie
to you, there were times when I wanted to...

901
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,349
...kill her, but...
- Likewise.

902
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,869
- Couldn't take the shot.
- That's a good sign.

903
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,560
- Who'd have thought?
- You have to battle through.

904
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:15,231
- That's marriage, right?
- Yeah. Take your best shot, and...

905
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,716
- Oh, we redid the house.
- We did. Yes, we did.

906
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:22,756
You know there will always be challenges?
Threats out there?

907
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,438
Yup.

908
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,199
But you can handle it together.

909
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:30,198
- So far.
- Yes, we can... So far?

910
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,470
What is that?

911
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,637
- I'm leaving room for the unknown.
- So far.

912
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:41,269
And do you feel your relationship styles
are more conducive to this...

913
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,119
Ask us the sex question.

914
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,071
John.

915
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,638
Well, that...

916
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:51,320
Ten.

917
