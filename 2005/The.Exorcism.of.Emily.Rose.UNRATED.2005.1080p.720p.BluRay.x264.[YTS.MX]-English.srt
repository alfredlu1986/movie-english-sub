1
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,182
Emily!

2
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,513
You're the medical examiner?

3
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,366
Mr. Rose?

4
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,565
I'm sorry, Mr. Rose...

5
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,182
but I cannot state conclusively...

6
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:39,344
that the cause of death
was natural.

7
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,778
Your daughter, she...

8
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,121
Excuse me, Father?

9
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,831
Father Moore.

10
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,533
You'll have to come with me.

11
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,458
- Father Moore!
- Will you plead guilty?

12
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,227
- Tell us about the exorcism!
- Over here, Father Moore!

13
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,631
We're at Crescent County Courthouse.
We show you Father Richard Moore...

14
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,498
- What about the parents?
- They're not talking to the police.

15
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,801
Do we charge them?

16
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,204
No. Even the priest admits
he ran the show.

17
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,039
We need a Christian on this.

18
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,440
Preferably a Catholic.

19
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,709
Somebody that knows this shit
inside out...

20
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,903
and who the public will see
as unbiased.

21
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,169
We're going after a holy man here.

22
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,035
Ethan Thomas.

23
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,657
He's not Catholic, though.
Methodist, I think.

24
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,327
But the guy practically lives at church.
Choir, teaches Sunday school.

25
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,680
He's no choirboy in the courtroom.
I've seen him tear people up.

26
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,990
He's a shrewd son of a bitch.

27
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,592
All right, pull him off whatever
he's doing. He's lead prosecutor.

28
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,265
There's ambition. She never stops.
She even works while she drinks.

29
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,507
- Gentlemen, you know Erin Bruner.
- Of course.

30
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,936
- Hello.
- I was so sure Van Hopper would fry...

31
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,872
but you proved me wrong, lady.

32
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,447
The system worked, that's all.

33
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,324
Gentlemen, you'll excuse us,
will you?

34
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,603
Have you seen the news
about this priest?

35
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,417
I heard something about an exorcism
gone bad, but I don't know the details.

36
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,020
The DA charged him
with negligent homicide.

37
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,623
They offered a very reasonable plea
bargain, but the priest turned it down.

38
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,157
Do not ask me to take this...

39
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,481
The archdiocese
specifically requested you.

40
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,265
- Why me?
- They followed the Van Hopper trial.

41
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,067
They think you're smart...

42
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,691
and convincing.

43
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,338
They want you to ask the priest
to reconsider.

44
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,740
Well, what if he won't?

45
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,900
This sounds like a quagmire.
If I'm smart, I'll leave it alone.

46
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,180
Erin, the Van Hopper case
got you back on the fast track.

47
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,383
Once again, you're a rising star.

48
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,169
- Chivas, neat, please.
- Tanqueray martini, dry.

49
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,721
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, you do this for me...

50
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,893
and the rising star keeps rising.

51
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,346
The case is yours.

52
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,056
And just how high
do I get to rise this time?

53
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,605
I've been junior partner
for too long now, Karl.

54
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,097
- It's not like other firms haven't called.
- Erin...

55
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,067
I want my name on the door,
right next to yours.

56
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,616
Okay.

57
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,035
Try to get the deal.

58
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,420
If the priest won't
and this goes to trial...

59
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,089
the archdiocese feels he could
be an embarrassment.

60
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,191
So under no circumstances
is he to testify.

61
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,760
No, of course.
If I'd put Van Hopper on the stand...

62
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,964
he'd be marking time on death row
instead of sunbathing in Miami.

63
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,554
His tab.

64
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,147
Good morning, I'm Erin Bruner.

65
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,777
May I sit down?

66
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,856
They brought the chair
for my public defender.

67
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,821
I guess they left it when they decided
I wasn't going to kill myself with it.

68
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,408
My firm represents the archdiocese.

69
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,409
Yes.

70
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,077
Yes, I was expecting them
to send someone.

71
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,829
- Why did they choose you?
- I wanted this case.

72
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,466
- So you like the spotlight?
- I'm used to it.

73
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,215
I defended James Van Hopper.

74
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,837
And now you've come
to further your celebrity.

75
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,290
No.

76
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,622
I'm here to make senior partner
at my firm.

77
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,381
- Are you a Catholic?
- No.

78
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,885
I'm an agnostic, I guess.
I'm not really sure.

79
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,907
If you're not sure, then you are one.

80
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,526
I don't think you're the right attorney.
I'll stick with my public defender.

81
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,195
He can't get the DA
to get you a better deal. I can.

82
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,264
I won't be making
any plea agreement.

83
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,699
If you don't, the archdiocese
won't post your bail.

84
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,983
You'll be stuck in here for the trial.

85
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,140
Do you understand how long
they can put you away?

86
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,549
It's been explained to me.

87
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,179
The DA's office doesn't like it when
religion holds itself above the law.

88
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,947
And this prosecutor,
Ethan Thomas?

89
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,950
You're gonna need somebody
hungry and smart...

90
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,919
and aggressive
to even have a chance.

91
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,671
What would your strategy be to defend
me against such a formidable man?

92
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,292
- That depends.
- On what?

93
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,848
On how you wanna be defended.

94
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,001
What's your main concern,
other than staying out of jail?

95
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,672
- Is it how you're being portrayed?
- I don't care about my reputation.

96
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,728
I'm not afraid of jail.

97
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,601
What I care about
is telling Emily Rose's story.

98
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,217
I want people to hear
what only I can tell.

99
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,085
And what is that?

100
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,853
What really happened to Emily...

101
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,978
and why.

102
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,595
If I let you defend me...

103
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,813
will you promise to let me testify and
tell the truth about what happened?

104
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:03,152
And what is the truth you would tell?
That the ritual killed her?

105
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,807
- Was it your fault she died?
- No.

106
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,076
All right.
Then I'll let you tell her story.

107
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,998
But only if you agree to let me do
whatever else it takes to win.

108
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,849
You're not used to
this kind of place.

109
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,323
I'm sure our life is very strange
to you.

110
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,057
Not so strange.

111
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,680
I grew up in a little town.

112
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,650
But our house wasn't as nice
or as big as this.

113
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,818
My mother, she raised me alone.

114
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,888
She was a schoolteacher,
so we had very little money.

115
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,343
What a wonderful thing to be.

116
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,141
That was Emily's dream,
to be a teacher.

117
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,021
That's why she went away
to the university.

118
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,456
A lot of cats live here.

119
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,045
There are...

120
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,914
11 now, I think.

121
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,616
Emily always brought them home.

122
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:26,608
Ever since she was a little girl,
she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.

123
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,694
Before these troubles began...

124
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,250
was Emily a happy girl?

125
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,411
Oh, yes.

126
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,834
Before she went away
to university...

127
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,857
my Emily was so very happy.

128
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,866
What is going on...? Girls!

129
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,834
Mama.

130
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,307
Is it...?

131
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,109
It's a scholarship, Mama.

132
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,276
They pay for it.
They pay for everything.

133
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,750
This is your dream, Emily.

134
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,516
You'll be leaving us.

135
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,618
It's okay.

136
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,625
I'll be okay.

137
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,764
I'm gonna show this to your father.

138
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,274
- Counselor. Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

139
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,656
Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Thomas?
He makes an excellent martini.

140
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,781
Just water for me, please.

141
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,761
So...

142
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,784
the judge thinks we should offer
a new plea agreement.

143
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,101
She feels the community might be
better served without this trial.

144
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,437
How do you feel about it?

145
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,323
Personally.

146
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,375
My job is to represent
the interests of the people...

147
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,261
and make an effort to be objective.

148
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,515
I ask because I know
you're a churchgoer.

149
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,507
Now you're set to prosecute
a man of God.

150
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,986
Your priest broke the law...

151
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,236
and a young girl is dead.

152
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,359
If he's a man of God, then, personally,
I think he's even more subject...

153
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,163
to the laws of moral behavior.
If it were up to me, he'd get no deal.

154
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,100
And forgiveness and compassion?
Isn't that part of your creed?

155
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,300
Or does that just get in the way
of your work?

156
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,841
If you have compassion
for your client...

157
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,343
you'll persuade him to accept this:

158
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,846
Charges reduced
to reckless endangerment.

159
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,148
Twelve months in a county jail.

160
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,973
Reducible to six, plus probation,
if he stays out of trouble.

161
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,637
Somehow I expect
he can manage that.

162
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,844
But please understand me.
If he refuses, I will seek the maximum.

163
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,060
Father Moore has made it clear
there will be no plea agreement.

164
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,030
He will not lie or admit to something
he is not guilty of.

165
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,733
- And he was never neglectful of Emily.
- "Never neglectful"?

166
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,725
Have you seen
the postmortem photographs?

167
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,895
We'll go to trial. My client wants
the public to know the truth.

168
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,363
Good.

169
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,303
So do I.

170
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,034
Have a good night, counselor.

171
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,059
Let the record show that the defendant
and his counsel are present...

172
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,945
and that the jury is seated.

173
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,265
- Mr. Thomas, you may begin.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

174
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,535
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Ethan Thomas.

175
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,139
I'm the assistant district attorney,
and I represent the people.

176
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,741
In the case before you,
the evidence will show...

177
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:45,613
that the victim had a serious medical
condition that demanded treatment.

178
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:50,017
We will prove that the victim's
condition rendered her physically...

179
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:55,189
and psychologically incapable
of caring for herself.

180
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,891
Her care...

181
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,811
was then wholly entrusted...

182
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,164
to that man, the defendant,
Father Richard Moore.

183
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,983
She became his responsibility...

184
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,804
and he betrayed
that responsibility...

185
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,506
by persuading her to abandon
her medical treatment...

186
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,222
in favor of religious treatment:

187
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,547
A ritual exorcism,
performed by the defendant...

188
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,709
allegedly to cure the victim
by ridding her of demonic forces.

189
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,990
We will demonstrate
that this course of action...

190
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,150
directly resulted
in the victim's death.

191
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,262
I said a moment ago
that I represent the people.

192
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,513
We all know what that means,
but it's a little abstract, isn't it?

193
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,202
Miss Bruner,
the attorney for the defense...

194
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,238
is seated right next
to the man she represents.

195
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,762
And I stand here
to represent the people.

196
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,202
That's not really why
I stand here today.

197
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,896
I'm here on behalf of someone
who can't sit at a table...

198
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,340
and look at you every day
and gain your sympathy...

199
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,724
someone who can't take the stand
to testify...

200
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,282
and tell you what happened
in her own words.

201
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,065
A young girl...

202
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,224
that could've been your daughter.

203
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,703
Could've been mine.

204
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,830
A girl who trusted
Father Richard Moore with her life.

205
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,164
This is what she looked like...

206
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,677
before the defendant began
his religious treatment.

207
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,016
This is a photograph taken of her
on the day that she died.

208
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,402
I stand here for Emily Rose...

209
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,472
who died horribly...

210
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,706
at age 19.

211
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,311
You won't be able to see Emily sitting
here day after day during this trial.

212
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,583
But I hope you'll remember her
as she was when she was alive...

213
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,947
and full of...

214
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,157
hopes and dreams.

215
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,033
And as she was when Father
Richard Moore was finished with her...

216
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,793
and left her to die.

217
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,803
Thank you.

218
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,008
Is the defense prepared
to make its opening statement?

219
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,027
I'd like to reserve
my opening statement...

220
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,463
until the presentation
of the defense's case.

221
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,451
As is your privilege.

222
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,301
Prosecution may begin.

223
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,970
That was already my plan.

224
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,672
Thank you, Your Honor.
The people call Dr. Edith Vogel.

225
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,611
I've known Emily her entire life.
I took care of all of the Rose girls.

226
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,847
Can you describe Emily
as you knew her growing up?

227
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,383
She was a bit sickly
in her early years.

228
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,204
She stayed inside a lot,
reading, learning music.

229
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,431
How did she feel about
going to school?

230
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,559
Objection.
The witness is not a psychiatrist.

231
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,896
I'll rephrase. Did you talk to Emily
about going off to college?

232
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,598
Yes. She told me she was excited...

233
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,270
but nervous that she would be away
from her family in the big city.

234
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,472
This was an overwhelming change
for her.

235
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,507
Did you stay in touch
after she went away?

236
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:39,113
Yes. She wrote me a letter
saying that she'd been to a dance...

237
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,363
and she'd met a boy
named Jason.

238
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,617
She didn't want her mother
to know this...

239
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,320
because her mother did not
approve of dancing...

240
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,589
and had warned her
about the boys at school.

241
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,526
Did Emily communicate with you again
last fall after you received the letter?

242
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,343
Actually, it was her mother.

243
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,432
She telephoned me...

244
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,251
waking me out of a deep sleep
at 4 in the morning.

245
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:07,062
She asked me to call Emily at
a payphone on the university campus.

246
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,165
When Emily answered,
she was quite hysterical.

247
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,771
At first, she just
sobbed uncontrollably.

248
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,002
But eventually she calmed down
enough to tell me what happened.

249
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,460
She said that she was alone
that weekend.

250
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,210
Her roommate had gone home.

251
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,283
She had awakened...

252
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,230
and thought she smelled
something burning.

253
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,859
There was no alarm,
but she got up...

254
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,830
afraid there was a fire.

255
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,966
Dr. Mueller, what's your position
at the university hospital?

256
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,803
I am chairman of
the Department of Neurology.

257
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:58,272
And after you heard
about the dorm-room incident...

258
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,040
what were your initial thoughts?

259
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,343
At first, I thought perhaps
Emily had taken illegal drugs.

260
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,345
Some type of hallucinogen.

261
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,383
But we ran tests and found no trace
of drugs in her system.

262
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,819
And the more she explained
the incident to me...

263
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:15,222
the more I began to suspect
something else.

264
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,907
Epilepsy results from uncontrolled
electrical activity in the brain.

265
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,796
In a severe, or grand mal, seizure...

266
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,499
a person may lose consciousness
for several minutes...

267
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,036
and suffer involuntary contractions
of all the muscles of the body.

268
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,638
Is it possible for a person
suffering such a seizure...

269
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,142
to have hallucinations or perceive
the things that Emily described?

270
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,846
The muscle contractions could feel
like an extreme pressure on the body.

271
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,882
And it is certainly possible,
with all that brain activity...

272
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,339
for a person to perceive all sorts
of strange and violent things.

273
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:50,057
So suspecting that Emily was
epileptic, how did you proceed?

274
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,459
I administered
an electroencephalograph.

275
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:53,861
What did the EEG reveal?

276
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:58,499
It showed a possible epileptic focus
in the patient's left temporal lobe.

277
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,467
Did this require
a specific treatment?

278
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,804
Yes, I began a medication schedule
for Emily with the drug Gambutrol.

279
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:08,041
I also advised regular follow-up
examinations and further tests.

280
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,235
But Emily failed to keep
her follow-up appointments with me.

281
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,481
She give any reason for discontinuing
these appointments?

282
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,352
Yes, she told me she was convinced
that her condition was a spiritual one.

283
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,823
It was the conviction of her priest,
she said, and she shared his beliefs.

284
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,592
Was it your impression
that Emily had placed her care...

285
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,682
entirely...?
- Leading the witness.

286
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,314
Sustained.

287
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,467
After the end of October...

288
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,969
did you ask Emily
why she had stopped...

289
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,838
filling her Gambutrol
prescriptions?

290
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:42,442
Yes. She said that Father Moore had
suggested she stop taking the drug.

291
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,278
And what, in your medical opinion...

292
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,680
was the result
of Father Moore's suggestion?

293
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,016
I believe Father Moore's suggestion
killed her.

294
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,584
Objection, Your Honor!

295
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,108
The witness is asserting outrageous
conclusions based on pure hearsay.

296
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,426
Technically correct, but I'll allow it
as part of his expert opinion testimony.

297
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,361
Thank you, Dr. Mueller.

298
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,763
Your witness.

299
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:07,968
You said you observed a possible
epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.

300
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,772
Doesn't this imply what you observed
may not have been an epileptic focus?

301
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,574
Yes, that's also possible.

302
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,910
Would Father Moore's advice to stop
taking Gambutrol be good advice...

303
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,046
if Emily were, in fact,
not epileptic?

304
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,399
Of course. But that's not
the case here. She was epileptic.

305
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,103
Really.

306
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,888
When Emily saw objects move
on their own...

307
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,891
and felt an invisible presence
on top of her...

308
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,594
was she experiencing symptoms
typical of epilepsy?

309
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,995
Not typical, no.

310
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,831
Are they typical indications
of any other conditions?

311
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,116
- Say, for example, psychosis?
- Yes, I would say that's correct.

312
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,823
But isn't psychosis an entirely different
medical condition from epilepsy?

313
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,282
- Yes, in my...
- So aren't you selectively choosing...

314
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,346
what parts of Emily's experiences
fit your epilepsy diagnosis...

315
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,781
while ignoring those which
indicate something else?

316
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,372
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.

317
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,144
No further questions.

318
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,955
We have to work fast.

319
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,512
They're only giving me an hour
with you tonight.

320
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,312
Listen.

321
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,563
Before we get started,
there's something I have to tell you...

322
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,867
something I should've said to you
before I let you take the case.

323
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,423
Okay.

324
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,696
There are forces
surrounding this trial.

325
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,561
Dark, powerful forces.

326
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,267
Just be careful, Erin.
Watch your step.

327
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,337
I see.

328
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,947
Look...

329
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,360
Father, you don't have to worry
about me.

330
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,018
I'm an agnostic, remember?

331
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,784
Demons exist,
whether you believe in them or not.

332
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,355
Your involvement in this trial might
just open you up to their attacks.

333
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,473
Look, Father,
I appreciate your concern...

334
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,909
but you need to be worried
about yourself.

335
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,412
Ethan Thomas is using the medical
aspects of this case as ammunition...

336
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,416
and I have to be prepared
for his attacks, so...

337
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:42,375
with what little time we have, I think
we need to focus on your defense.

338
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,138
Now, what I need from you is more
information about Emily's condition.

339
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,342
Specific details of how it progressed
after the dorm-room episode.

340
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,611
Well, after the first incident...

341
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:10,741
she was sent to the university
hospital for testing and observation.

342
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,624
Emily once told me that in her
dorm room, she resisted the demons...

343
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,647
but at the hospital
they overcame her.

344
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,462
So she believed...

345
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,814
that her possession
began at the hospital?

346
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,868
Yeah, I think she did.

347
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,028
And after that, things just went
from bad to worse.

348
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,087
Emily!

349
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,792
Emily?

350
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,350
Oh, my God. Emily?

351
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,421
Don't touch me.

352
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,166
Jason, please...

353
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,609
don't leave me.

354
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,463
And I never did leave her.

355
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,246
I stayed until the end.

356
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,138
So much of what we shared
was like a nightmare...

357
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,298
but I wouldn't give up
a single minute I spent with her.

358
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,912
She woke me up, you know?

359
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:10,631
To things I never felt before,
things I never knew I could feel.

360
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,111
I never knew how dead I was
until I met her.

361
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,430
- Residential north metro district
where James Van Hopper...

362
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,899
acquitted after
a controversial trial...

363
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,868
- Can you turn that up, please?
- has apparently struck again.

364
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,904
It was inside
this quiet suburban home...

365
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,708
that police say James Van Hopper
murdered a young couple today.

366
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,610
Sources close to the investigation
say that Van Hopper...

367
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,046
who was acquitted
of murder charges in April...

368
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,182
may have known
both of the victims.

369
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,366
Their names are being withheld
pending family notification.

370
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,377
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly army...

371
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,512
holy Michael, the archangel...

372
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,981
defend us in battle
against the princes...

373
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,606
powers and rulers of darkness.

374
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:09,075
Counsel Bruner, my courtroom day
begins at 9:30 a. m.

375
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,236
- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...
- Which was 17 minutes ago.

376
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,830
Ready to proceed?

377
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,318
Yes, Your Honor.

378
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,088
Dr. Briggs, please state
your qualifications for the court.

379
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,457
I have advanced degrees
in medicine...

380
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,560
psychiatry and neurology
from Johns Hopkins...

381
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,864
and I have had three books
and several dozen papers published...

382
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,934
in the fields of neurology
and neuropsychiatry.

383
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,171
What was the cause of death,
as determined by the autopsy?

384
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,708
The decedent expired due to a gradual
shutdown of the bodily functions.

385
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,777
Why did her body shut down?

386
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,914
The autopsy found
that it was a cumulative effect...

387
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,751
from numerous physical traumas
exacerbated by malnutrition...

388
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:56,823
which severely inhibited her ability
to recuperate from those traumas.

389
00:41:57,148 --> 00:42:01,461
In other words, her starving body
had little or no means to recover...

390
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:05,598
from the injuries it was sustaining,
and so it eventually just gave out.

391
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,433
How did Emily get these injuries?

392
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,436
Some were the result
of violent epileptic seizures...

393
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,271
and some were self-inflicted.

394
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,174
And why, in your opinion,
did Emily injure herself...

395
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,809
and why did she stop eating?

396
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,179
Upon review
of her complete medical file...

397
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,882
I concluded that Emily's epilepsy
had evolved...

398
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,552
into a condition known as
psychotic epileptic disorder.

399
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,544
This is a rare development,
to be sure...

400
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,090
but one that I have witnessed
numerous times.

401
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:35,061
- Emily was epileptic and psychotic?
- Yes.

402
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,731
Explain how this psychotic epileptic
disorder would manifest itself.

403
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,734
The seizures would have
the symptoms of schizophrenia...

404
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,326
such as auditory
and visual hallucinations...

405
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,974
and sometimes extreme paranoia.

406
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,410
The seizures may lock up the joints
and slightly contort the body.

407
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,614
The pupils will dilate,
making the eyes appear black.

408
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,616
So you believe
that Emily had epilepsy...

409
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,585
which developed into
a form of violent psychosis...

410
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,088
a condition that can be controlled
with Gambutrol?

411
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,725
Yes. And it would've been,
if she'd continued her treatment.

412
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,694
In your opinion, if Emily
had continued with her medication...

413
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,364
would she be alive today?
- Absolutely.

414
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:16,936
If treated early, psychotic epileptic
disorder is rarely fatal.

415
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,738
I mean, this...

416
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,296
This was a very sick girl.

417
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,144
The defendant should've realized
that Emily was in need...

418
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,065
of continued medical treatment.

419
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,907
Thank you, doctor.
Your witness.

420
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,872
Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol
could've controlled Emily's condition.

421
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,793
How do you know that?

422
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,564
It's the inevitable result
of taking the drug.

423
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,632
It would've controlled
her seizures...

424
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,834
which were the root cause
of her psychosis.

425
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,971
But wasn't Emily still experiencing
psychotic symptoms...

426
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,273
even after she started
taking the medication?

427
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,343
Yes. Because Gambutrol
has a cumulative effect.

428
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,612
It takes time to build up
in the system.

429
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:03,182
You assume that Gambutrol would've
helped her, but you don't know.

430
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,637
It's a reasonable assumption, but...

431
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,734
No, of course, I can't be certain.

432
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:14,694
Doctor, is "psychotic epileptic
disorder" a common medical term...

433
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,477
or did you just make it up?

434
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,732
Well, I distinguished
and named the...

435
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,302
So psychotic epileptic disorder
is really your own pet theory?

436
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,252
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

437
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,275
When Emily chose
to stop her medical treatment...

438
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,510
what do you think
should've been done?

439
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,412
Upon recognizing her condition...

440
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:36,782
I would have tranquilized her
and force-fed her.

441
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,284
And then, if necessary...

442
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,987
I would've treated her
with electroconvulsive therapy.

443
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:44,113
Electroshock treatment. You would've
done this against her will?

444
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,314
To save her life?

445
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,218
Absolutely.

446
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,465
Nothing further.

447
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,801
The witness may step down.

448
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,852
Your Honor, I offer into evidence this
photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A.

449
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,687
And having done so,
the people rest.

450
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,822
The photograph is entered
into evidence.

451
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:21,961
We are recessed until
tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp...

452
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,031
at which time the defense
will give its opening statement...

453
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:26,917
and call its first witness.

454
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,236
I'm sorry I was late.

455
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,906
I didn't get a lot of sleep. Big power
outage knocked out my alarm clock.

456
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,398
- It won't happen again.
- No, I didn't sleep either.

457
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,432
What kept you awake?

458
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:40,970
Doesn't matter.

459
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,700
You're under attack.

460
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,867
What are you talking about?

461
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,157
You're in a spiritual battle, Erin.

462
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,545
The forces of darkness are trying
to keep you away from the light.

463
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,653
Don't let them.

464
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,015
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.

465
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,272
We're getting creamed.
I can't believe I walked right into that.

466
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,642
Look, if we don't find a doctor
to testify that Emily...

467
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:15,100
wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic
or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose.

468
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,425
Care of the city's main branch
and the university library...

469
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,828
I bring you another dozen
fun-filled books...

470
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,420
about the demonic
and the mentally deranged.

471
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,301
They burned women at the stake...

472
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,570
during witch hunts
for being possessed.

473
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,572
Glad you don't have to defend
those guys.

474
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,174
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.

475
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:45,578
The psychiatrist you wanted
is tied up in another trial.

476
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:49,749
And the neurologist is sailing
to Costa Rica.

477
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,135
This book I'm reading,
it's by an anthropologist.

478
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,455
It's about contemporary cases of
possession, mostly in the Third World.

479
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,924
People there are still
primitive and superstitious.

480
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,493
Maybe.

481
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,329
Maybe they see possession
for what it really is.

482
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,419
Maybe we've taught ourselves
not to see it.

483
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:09,568
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.

484
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:13,072
Maybe we shouldn't just try
to invalidate the prosecution's case...

485
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,841
by punching holes
in the medical approach.

486
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,503
Maybe we should also try
to validate the alternative.

487
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:28,044
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.

488
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,126
Okay. I guess we could bring in
some priests to talk about exorcisms...

489
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,562
No, the archdiocese
won't let us do that.

490
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:40,099
They wanna limit the Church's
exposure to Father Moore.

491
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:43,202
I've got three articles by the
anthropologist who wrote this book.

492
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,371
She approaches
the subject of possession...

493
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,974
from a scientific perspective
and doesn't try to debunk it.

494
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,997
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.

495
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,382
Keep looking for a medical expert
to refute Dr. Briggs.

496
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,337
But send the case file
to this Dr. Sadira Adani.

497
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,255
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

498
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,025
as you know by now,
my name is Erin Bruner...

499
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,377
and I represent the defendant,
Richard Moore.

500
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,665
Mr. Thomas has contended
that Emily Rose suffered...

501
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,800
from a serious medical condition...

502
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,404
that required medical treatment,
nothing more.

503
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,273
He has asserted that any attempt
by my client...

504
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,543
to help Emily by anything
other than medical means...

505
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,602
was not only inappropriate,
but criminally negligent.

506
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,818
I'm now gonna ask
that you keep an open mind...

507
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:36,288
to what our evidence
and testimony will show.

508
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,425
Medical treatment was not
the answer for Emily...

509
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,262
because she simply did not suffer
from a medical condition.

510
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:47,981
She was neither epileptic
nor psychotic.

511
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,406
Emily Rose's condition, in fact,
was demonic possession.

512
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:58,110
An exorcism was her only hope
for a cure.

513
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:02,281
Some of you may find yourself unable
to reconcile Emily's beliefs...

514
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,783
or those of the defendant
with your own.

515
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:09,138
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.

516
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:13,140
Because you will see that after the
utter failure of doctors to help Emily...

517
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,329
Father Moore simply tried
to help Emily in a different way...

518
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:23,068
using an approach that he,
Emily and her family firmly believed...

519
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,437
was her only chance for relief.

520
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,274
And we will show that
despite his greatest efforts...

521
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,626
and his sincere love for Emily...

522
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:37,004
there was nothing he could've done
to prevent the death of Emily Rose.

523
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,175
Are you okay?

524
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,004
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

525
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,782
She said it was terrible to hear
the clinking of spoons and forks.

526
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,120
She was always hungry,
but she said they wouldn't let her eat.

527
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,518
Who did she mean by "they"?

528
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,372
The forces that were
in control of her.

529
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,895
That were inside her.

530
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:38,957
You know, the demons.

531
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,232
Tell us what else happened
that night.

532
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,745
I walked her back to her dorm...

533
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,125
and she seemed really nervous
and scared.

534
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,129
So I held her for a while,
trying to calm her down.

535
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:02,815
I fell asleep, but when I woke up,
she wasn't beside me.

536
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,431
Emily?

537
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,143
Hey.

538
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,193
Can you hear me?

539
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,800
I called her father, and he told me
to bring Emily home.

540
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,655
Jason and I put Emily to bed...

541
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,024
hoping she would sleep.

542
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,217
And when did Father Moore
become involved?

543
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,064
Emily stayed home after that.

544
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:09,368
She didn't return to school,
and she kept getting worse.

545
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:14,223
Eventually, when she didn't get better,
we called our priest, Father Moore.

546
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,609
When he arrived,
I sent my daughter Alice upstairs...

547
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,200
to see if Emily was awake.

548
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,010
Emily?

549
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,185
Can I come in?

550
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:53,462
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Emily?

551
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,486
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs?

552
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,888
- As it is in heaven.

553
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,480
Give us this day our daily bread...

554
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,494
Emily, can you hear me?

555
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:59,819
Ego sum qui intus habitat.
(I am the one that dwells within)

556
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,981
Let's get her off the floor.

557
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,444
Alice, no!

558
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:32,569
Ego sum qui intus habitat.
[I am the one that dwells within]

559
00:54:34,894 --> 00:54:39,494
Et ego sum qui﻿ venit in nomine eius.
[And I am the one who comes  in His name.]

560
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,544
Num putas me expellere, sacerdos?
[You really think you can cast me out, priest?]

561
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:48,744
Tente.
[Try.]

562
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:50,969
Ego te provoco.
[I dare you.]

563
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,527
You've suffered a terrible loss,
Mr. Rose. I know this is difficult.

564
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,096
So thank you for being here today.

565
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,798
Sir, do you often read the Bible?

566
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,786
- Yes, I do.
- So do I.

567
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,536
What about the DSM?

568
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,606
The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders...

569
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,876
commonly referred to
as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.

570
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,577
- Have you read that?
- No.

571
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,013
So you're not aware
that according to the DSM...

572
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:19,384
a person's refusal to eat is
a common indication of anorexia?

573
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,021
Objection. The witness just said
he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor.

574
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,544
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose...

575
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,293
are you aware
that catatonic rigidity...

576
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,862
specifically a locking up
of the body's joints...

577
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,731
is a known symptom of psychosis?

578
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,233
No. I haven't studied these things.

579
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,585
Have you ever visited
an insane asylum...

580
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,054
or a hospital for the mentally ill?

581
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,575
Once. My aunt was in one
before she died.

582
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,894
Really? So there's a history
of mental illness in your family?

583
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,914
I suppose.

584
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,006
Sir, if you saw someone
eating insects...

585
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:56,688
on a street corner, would you say
that that person is mentally ill?

586
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,391
- Probably, yes.
- So can you say with confidence...

587
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,160
that the behavior you saw
in your daughter's bedroom...

588
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,263
could not be the behavior of
someone suffering from psychosis?

589
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:09,288
I don't know. She never had
any problems like that before.

590
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,794
It just didn't feel that way to me
or to Father Moore.

591
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,009
- And you trusted him, right?
- Yes.

592
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:18,877
He is our parish priest.

593
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,280
Fair enough. And after that night,
would you say that you...

594
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,017
put your daughter entirely
in Father Moore's care?

595
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,753
Yes. We had done all we could.

596
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:30,276
We said she was in his hands now...

597
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,645
body and soul.

598
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,728
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

599
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,921
Thank you, Mr. Rose.
You may step down.

600
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,935
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.

601
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,306
I am currently a professor
of anthropology and psychiatry...

602
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,609
at Northwestern University.

603
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,477
Where did you receive
your education?

604
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,880
At Yale, and then at Cambridge.

605
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,482
And what is your specific area
of expertise?

606
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,987
I study the spiritual experiences
of people in various cultures...

607
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,490
and the physiological
and psychological changes...

608
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,061
they undergo
during these experiences.

609
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:13,265
Would it be accurate to say that you
specialize in the study of possession?

610
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:18,470
Yes. "Possession" is one term
for a basic human experience...

611
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:23,475
reported by a great number
of people all around the world.

612
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,712
In my fieldwork, I've seen
many people who experienced...

613
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:32,651
a sense of being invaded by
an entity from the supernatural realm.

614
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,786
Why do you think
Emily was invaded?

615
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,255
Why did this possession
happen to her?

616
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,891
Based on my study of the case file...

617
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,162
I believe that Emily Rose
was a hypersensitive.

618
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,832
A person with
an unusual connection...

619
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:50,857
to what Carlos Castaneda called
"the separate reality."

620
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:56,007
Hypersensitives are born
different from everyone else.

621
00:58:56,332 --> 00:59:00,045
They can have visions of the future,
or see the dead...

622
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,482
and sometimes be
uniquely susceptible...

623
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,685
to invasion by an entity
that is alien to them.

624
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,036
Objection.

625
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,423
On what grounds?

626
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,458
How about silliness, Your Honor?

627
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,408
A young girl
suffered terribly and died.

628
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:19,064
Do we have to subject her illness
to this pseudoscientific analysis?

629
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,190
Both counselors,
please approach the bench.

630
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,137
Your Honor, this testimony
is beyond ridiculous. Visions...

631
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:28,507
Supernatural belief systems
are shared by millions of people.

632
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,166
We're in The Twilight Zone here.

633
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,677
Her expertise is relevant
to the issues in this case.

634
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,980
Let's have a witch doctor
sift through bones...

635
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,638
Stop.

636
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,887
We've heard a great deal
of testimony...

637
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:46,158
in support of a medical explanation
for Emily's condition.

638
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,483
Now we have a witness
who has spent her career...

639
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,897
studying the defense's
alternative explanation.

640
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:54,113
An exorcism expert, if you will.

641
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,702
I think we'll hear
what she has to say.

642
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,189
Thank you, Your Honor.

643
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:06,058
Dr. Adani, why do you think
Emily's exorcism failed?

644
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:11,449
The medical treatment.
Specifically, the drug Gambutrol.

645
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,084
Please explain.

646
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:17,689
The exorcism ritual results
in a specific brain activity...

647
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:21,645
that cuts the person off from
the possession experience.

648
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:26,631
But Emily's exorcism
could not have achieved this...

649
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,534
because the doctor
gave her Gambutrol...

650
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:33,605
which has an intoxicating effect
on the brain.

651
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,742
The drug made her immune
to the psycho-spiritual shock...

652
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,879
that exorcism
is intended to provide.

653
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:45,050
What do you believe was the result of
treatment with this intoxicating drug?

654
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,954
Gambutrol locked Emily
in the possessed state.

655
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,524
This left her unable to respond
to the exorcism...

656
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,981
and therefore, it directly
contributed to her death.

657
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,453
Thank you, doctor.

658
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,353
No further questions.

659
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,277
I'm looking at a list of
your published articles, doctor.

660
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,613
You've been quite busy and prolific.

661
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:18,350
So based on your time spent
with Holy Roller snake-handlers...

662
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,687
voodoo priestesses
and Indians tripping on peyote buds...

663
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:26,658
based on observing
these bizarre individuals...

664
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,860
you've concluded
that possession is...

665
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,629
a basic, typical
human experience?

666
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:32,397
I must say, counselor...

667
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:35,166
that's quite a laundry list
of disdain...

668
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:38,883
and one that thoroughly
mischaracterizes my research.

669
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,808
No, I don't think possession
is a typical experience.

670
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:48,647
But I am convinced that it is
a scientifically verified...

671
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,749
culturally universal one.

672
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,351
Have you ever used Gambutrol
in your studies...

673
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,921
to test your theory about its effect
on the possession experience?

674
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:00,592
Absolutely not. That would be
dangerous to the patient.

675
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:04,562
So this notion of Gambutrol locking
someone in a possessed state...

676
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,099
the key to your assertion that
her medical treatment harmed Emily...

677
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,435
this would be your own
pet theory, correct?

678
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,260
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection. Argumentative.

679
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,806
Sustained.

680
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,489
Although I think he's just taking
a page from your book, counselor.

681
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,165
No further questions.

682
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,873
Erin!

683
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,249
I've got a doctor
who wants to testify.

684
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,429
He's an eyewitness, Erin.

685
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,464
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.

686
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,020
- What?
- He called us.

687
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,369
Dr. Graham Cartwright,
Department of Abnormal Psychiatry...

688
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,528
at St. Mary's Hospital.

689
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,667
Dr. Cartwright. Ring a bell?

690
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,596
Yes.

691
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,872
He was there?

692
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,071
- Yes.
- Father...

693
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,459
if you want me to defend you,
you've got to give me...

694
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,194
all the information I need.

695
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,297
With all of this medical testimony
helping the prosecution...

696
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,923
how could you not tell me
that a doctor attended the exorcism?

697
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,690
He asked that I keep
his involvement confidential...

698
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:23,630
and I said I would.

699
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,213
Dr. Cartwright?

700
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,281
I recognize you from those
courtroom drawings on the news.

701
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,619
You're much prettier in real life.

702
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,326
- May I sit?
- Yes, please.

703
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,362
You're losing.

704
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,472
I had hoped Father Moore
wouldn't need me...

705
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,245
but I don't wanna see him
put away.

706
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,592
How do you know him?

707
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,396
Well, I was his parishioner
at St. Vincent's Church...

708
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,088
about 15 years ago.

709
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,854
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years
when he called me last fall.

710
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,627
But he needed help, so...

711
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,367
What kind of help, doctor?

712
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:35,547
He wanted a medical perspective
from a psychiatrist...

713
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,017
you know, one that he knew,
trusted...

714
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:44,680
to observe Emily's physical
and mental state during this...

715
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,450
During the exorcism.

716
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,547
Yeah.

717
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:58,784
Doctor.

718
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,421
Doctor.

719
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,024
Can you help our case?

720
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,648
That girl was not schizophrenic...

721
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,952
and she was not epileptic,
or any combination of the two.

722
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,354
I've seen hundreds of people
with those problems.

723
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,892
They can be terrible afflictions,
of course, but they don't scare me.

724
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,962
But what you saw that night in Emily,
that did scare you.

725
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,849
God, if I'd known,
I never would've been there.

726
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,219
I started praying again
since then, you know.

727
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:40,527
I examined that girl before I drove
back to the city that night.

728
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,313
She was lucid...

729
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:46,406
and she was completely aware
of this separate entity inside her.

730
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:51,823
When she wasn't in his grip, she was
totally herself, completely normal.

731
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:56,027
The awareness of her alternate mental
state is counterindicative of psychosis.

732
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,894
Crazy people
don't know they're crazy.

733
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,520
That's right.

734
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,234
You'll testify to all of this, in detail?

735
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,969
Everything you saw?

736
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:08,039
Send me the case files
and tell me when to be in court.

737
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,255
Thank you, doctor.

738
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,963
We need this.

739
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,315
Before he was arrested,
Father Moore sent this to me.

740
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,940
He asked me to take care of it.

741
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:23,374
It's your burden now.

742
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,325
One more thing.
When you saw Emily...

743
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,542
did Father Moore ask you
to give her any medical help?

744
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:35,767
He was already trying to stop her from
injuring herself and urging her to eat.

745
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,620
And I told him, as a doctor,
I couldn't help her.

746
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,902
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.

747
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,820
Don't you get it?

748
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,256
He's not just an eyewitness
to the exorcism.

749
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:01,626
He can also refute the prosecution's
medical case. This is huge for us.

750
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,842
When do I get to testify?

751
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,998
I don't know. Let's take this
one step at a time.

752
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:08,499
No.

753
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:13,821
What matters most is Emily's story,
which only I can tell.

754
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,323
I understand.

755
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,504
Have you thought about
what I said before?

756
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:27,475
About dark forces
and demonic attacks?

757
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,209
Yes, I have.

758
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:43,314
That day, after Briggs testified...

759
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,825
I was feeling awful.

760
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:51,976
And I went out for a walk
just to clear my head...

761
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:56,467
and I was thinking about
what you said to me. Thinking:

762
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,784
"What if demons really do exist?"

763
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:03,467
And wondering what that
would mean if I believed that.

764
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:09,347
Because God knows,
I have my own demons.

765
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,348
And I saw something
lying on the sidewalk.

766
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,353
It was a gold locket...

767
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:24,655
with the initials E. C.B.
engraved on it.

768
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,348
My middle name is Christine.

769
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,940
Erin Christine Bruner.

770
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:39,357
And of all the people walking by
that day, I found that locket.

771
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,277
What are the chances of that?

772
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,363
I don't know, maybe it was a sign.

773
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:49,600
Or maybe it was just some
incredible coincidence.

774
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,170
But it made me feel...

775
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,574
like no matter what mistakes
I've made in the past...

776
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,545
at that moment, I was exactly
where I was meant to be.

777
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,931
Like I was on the right path.

778
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:09,039
You sound more like a mystic
than an agnostic.

779
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,110
Are you wearing the locket now?

780
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,078
No.

781
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,183
You should.

782
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,986
The archdiocese
doesn't want you to testify.

783
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,409
They're just afraid
that I'll embarrass them.

784
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,899
Testify to some medieval-sounding
supernatural nonsense.

785
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,898
They're expecting me
to talk you out of it.

786
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,765
I've just decided
I'm not even gonna try.

787
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,007
Why not?

788
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:47,125
If the archdiocese
wants to avoid embarrassment...

789
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,012
they need you to walk out of here
a free man.

790
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,331
I believe a jury will find you
sincere and credible...

791
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,367
and when Dr. Cartwright
corroborates your testimony...

792
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,870
and refutes the prosecution's
medical arguments...

793
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,722
we'll get an acquittal.

794
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,963
And everyone will thank me for it.

795
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,069
Emily!

796
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,550
God help me.

797
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:12,043
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

798
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,444
I do.

799
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,013
Father Moore, before you could
perform the exorcism...

800
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,783
you had to get the sanction
of the Church, correct?

801
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,319
Yes, on October the 27th
of last year...

802
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:25,323
I presented my assessment and
recommendation to the archbishop...

803
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:30,008
and he authorized the exorcism
that day before I left the office.

804
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,228
Tell us what happened that night.

805
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,265
I drove home.

806
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,702
I sat up till after midnight
studying The Roman Ritual...

807
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,437
thinking about what lay ahead.

808
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,572
You mean The Roman Ritual
of Exorcism.

809
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,341
A text used by Catholic priests...

810
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,543
as a guide to performing
the exorcism rite.

811
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,412
Yes, I think I actually fell asleep
with the book in my hand.

812
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,448
What happened next?

813
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,732
I woke up, freezing.

814
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:56,020
It was exactly 3 a. m.

815
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,941
Three a. m. is the demonic
witching hour.

816
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:02,193
It's a way for demons
to mock the Holy Trinity.

817
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:05,663
It's an inversion of 3 p. m.,
the miracle hour...

818
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:10,552
which is traditionally accepted
as the hour of Christ's death.

819
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:13,561
I thought I smelled
something burning.

820
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,399
Only later did I connect it...

821
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,845
and I remembered that that same
smell of something burning...

822
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,595
had been perceived by Emily.

823
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:38,040
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners, now and...

824
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:46,748
Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our...

825
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,290
At the hour of...

826
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:28,320
What do you make of this gesture,
this nod in your direction?

827
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:34,428
I don't know. Some kind
of acknowledgment, I guess.

828
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,129
That the game is on.

829
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,120
You're really God's gunslinger,
aren't you, Father?

830
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:46,791
Standing tall and facing the devil
with your prayer book at your side.

831
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:49,360
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's harassing my witness.

832
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:53,964
Sustained. Mr. Thomas, you know
I won't allow that in my courtroom.

833
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,214
Forgive me, Your Honor.

834
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:02,039
Father, did you understand this
black-robed figure to be the devil?

835
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:04,031
I believe it was
a demonic manifestation.

836
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,577
Like the demonic force
you believe possessed Emily?

837
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,746
- Yes.
- Why do you think it appeared to you?

838
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,282
I believe the demonic
can appear as an apparition...

839
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,476
much like a ghost,
in an attempt to excite our fear.

840
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,970
- Did it excite your fear, Father?
- It scared the hell out of me.

841
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,625
So this night, when you began to
prepare Emily's exorcism...

842
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,261
was it your first encounter
with this demon ghost?

843
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,351
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?

844
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,220
I've seen it ever since.

845
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,299
No further questions at this time.

846
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,865
Redirect, Your Honor.

847
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,488
Father Moore, after you received
the bishop's authorization...

848
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:52,456
when did you proceed
with an exorcism?

849
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:53,978
October 31st.

850
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,984
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

851
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,998
Halloween tradition is based on
legends throughout history...

852
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,335
that indicate a real increase
in spiritual activity on that night...

853
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,605
and I thought we could use the
occasion to draw them into the open.

854
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,974
- The demons, you mean?
- Yes.

855
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,632
Father Moore...

856
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:15,479
can you identify this?

857
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,401
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.

858
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,634
Inside is the tape I made that night.

859
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,523
Why would you make such a tape?

860
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,791
Ever since the technology
has been available...

861
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:31,428
exorcists have used tape recorders
to authenticate the ritual...

862
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,330
and provide a record for review.

863
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,534
I offer into evidence this
cassette recorder and audiotape...

864
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:39,970
Objection. The people were not aware
of the existence of this tape...

865
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,839
until last night.
- Neither were we.

866
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,009
This tape is new evidence that came
into our possession yesterday.

867
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,412
We provided counsel for the people
with a transcript of its contents.

868
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,015
You mean this tape was not
given to you by your client?

869
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,751
No, Your Honor. We received it
from a reluctant witness...

870
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:57,521
Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also
be called to testify to its authenticity.

871
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,457
The people will find his name
on the updated witness list...

872
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,343
we provided to them this morning.

873
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:09,020
Very well. I'll allow it into evidence.

874
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,591
Father Moore.

875
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,526
Will you play the tape for us now?

876
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,909
This is the exorcism of Emily Rose.

877
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:32,869
Those present are myself,
Father Richard Moore...

878
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:37,350
Nathaniel, Emily's father...

879
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,480
Jason, her friend...

880
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:46,854
a doctor who is here
to monitor Emily during the ritual...

881
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,440
and Emily herself...

882
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:53,567
who has given her permission
for the ritual to be performed.

883
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,766
All right, now listen.

884
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:02,753
You may say the rosary or any
private prayer for her deliverance...

885
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,956
when you're not responding
to my words.

886
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,944
Above all...

887
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,281
do whatever I ask,
without question.

888
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,599
Don't ask it any questions...

889
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:19,157
or pay any attention
to what it says.

890
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,939
"It"?

891
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,530
We won't be dealing
with Emily tonight.

892
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,363
Restrain her.

893
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:42,707
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

894
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,400
It has begun.

895
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:07,000
Let us pray.

896
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,460
"Because she hopes
in you, my God."

897
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:19,586
"Send her help from
the holy place, Lord."

898
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,433
"And give her heavenly protection."

899
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,735
"May the Lord be with you."

900
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,304
"And with your spirit."

901
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:32,660
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

902
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,588
My God. Are you all right?

903
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,980
Ein Kuss ein Kreuz und Bitten?
[A kiss a cross and wishes? ]

904
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,780
Glaubst du etwa, das wird dein kleines Mädchen retten?
[You really think that will save your little girl?]

905
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:49,493
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

906
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,395
I'm fine.

907
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,164
Give us this day our daily bread.

908
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:59,770
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those that trespass against us.

909
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,872
And lead us not into temptation...

910
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:06,363
But deliver us from evil!

911
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:11,227
Who are you, demon?
Tell me your name.

912
01:20:19,952 --> 01:20:23,352
Ego sum qui intus habitat...
[I am the one who dwells within...]

913
01:20:23,677 --> 01:20:25,577
In nomine christi...
[In the name of Christ...]

914
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:27,398
designate!
[identify!]

915
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:31,068
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

916
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,371
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.

917
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:37,463
One, two, three, four, five, six.

918
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,602
Father Moore!

919
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:56,911
Papa!

920
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,059
Emily!

921
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,005
Emily!

922
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:30,350
She feels so hot, Father!
She's burning up!

923
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:37,450
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!

924
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:43,725
Emily!

925
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,843
Doctor! I need you here now.

926
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,648
Watch her vital signs.

927
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,267
In the beginning was the word.

928
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,236
And the word was with God.

929
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:15,873
And the word was the word,
and what a wonderful word it was.

930
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:17,448
Through him all things remain.

931
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,226
Without him, nothing was made
that has been made.

932
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,415
And the 70 disciples
returned again with joy, saying:

933
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,353
"Lord, even the devils are subject
unto us through thy name."

934
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:32,756
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.

935
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:36,747
I beheld Satan as lightning
fall from heaven.

936
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,698
Behold. I give you power to tread
on serpents and scorpions...

937
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,034
and over all the power
of the enemy.

938
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,319
And nothing shall,
by any means, hurt you.

939
01:22:47,844 --> 01:22:50,044
Ouden?
[ Nothing at all? ]

940
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,745
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

941
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:23,331
Release him, demon. I command you
in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

942
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,001
Tell me your name, wicked one.

943
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:39,056
One, two, three, four, five, six!

944
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,858
He who commands you is he who
ordered you thrown down...

945
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,561
from the highest heaven
into the depths of hell.

946
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:49,519
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
I now command you:

947
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,185
Tell me your name!

948
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:53,628
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs!
[One, two, three, four, five, six!]

949
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,724
Hear, therefore, and fear,
Satan, enemy of the faith.

950
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,658
Give me your name, demon!

951
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:03,313
Names!

952
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:06,564
Names!

953
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:09,389
One, two, three, four, five, six!

954
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:15,209
Ancient serpents...

955
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:19,320
depart from this servant of God!

956
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,053
Tell me your six names!

957
01:24:23,325 --> 01:24:27,685
We are the ones who dwell within!

958
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:31,410
I am the one who dwelt within Cain!

959
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:34,435
I am the one who dwelt within Nero!

960
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,460
I once dwelt within Judas!

961
01:24:37,885 --> 01:24:39,785
And I was with Legion!

962
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:42,810
I am Belial!

963
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:47,157
And I am Lucifer

964
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:50,215
the devil in the flesh.

965
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:07,310
Mr. Rose.

966
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:09,560
Doctor, help him!

967
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,566
After a few moments,
Mr. Rose revived...

968
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,555
but the exorcism
had to be abandoned.

969
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:38,041
Emily was taken to her room
and soon fell into a deep sleep.

970
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,099
The whole thing
was a complete failure.

971
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:45,015
Describe her behavior from the night
of the failed exorcism...

972
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,832
until the time of her death.

973
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,319
Violence towards others and herself.

974
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:52,389
Sometimes she screamed
for hours on end.

975
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,726
She drove her head through windows,
tried to bite...

976
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:59,129
Tried to bite holes in the walls,
breaking several more of her teeth...

977
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,765
as you saw in
the postmortem photograph.

978
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,101
- You witnessed this?
- Some of it, yes.

979
01:26:04,426 --> 01:26:06,487
I tried to visit every day...

980
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:08,672
and the family told me the rest.

981
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,455
Did you attempt another exorcism?

982
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:14,111
I wanted to, but Emily refused.

983
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:16,186
And without the consent
of the possessed...

984
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,782
the exorcism ritual
can't be performed.

985
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:20,599
Did you encourage her to eat?

986
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,253
Yes, every time I saw her...

987
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,470
but the few times she tried,
it seemed like...

988
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:29,860
Seemed like she couldn't swallow,
or she couldn't keep it down.

989
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,361
What about medical care?

990
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,965
I wanted her to continue. I never said
she should quit seeing her doctors.

991
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,567
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.

992
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:40,989
But you did suggest she stop
taking the drug Gambutrol.

993
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:45,660
Yes.

994
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:51,661
After the exorcism,
she asked for my counsel.

995
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,317
She told me that the drugs
had never helped her.

996
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:57,354
After all, she was on Gambutrol
during the exorcism...

997
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,070
when her so-called symptoms
were at their peak.

998
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:05,595
Ultimately, we both felt that
she was beyond medical care...

999
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,189
and that she had to see this
through to the end...

1000
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:12,751
by faith alone.

1001
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,932
The dual voices we just heard
on this tape...

1002
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:26,082
you're certain that they were both
coming from Emily at the same time?

1003
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,551
Yes. Yes, I heard them.

1004
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:30,267
Have you tampered
with this tape in any way?

1005
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,339
No. No, I have not.

1006
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:36,282
No further questions at this time.

1007
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:42,284
Mr. Thomas.

1008
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:50,257
Father Moore, you consider this tape
to be proof of the supernatural?

1009
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:54,978
I think it's a record
of certain indications...

1010
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:57,047
that Emily was possessed.

1011
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,956
Signs of possession,
you may call them.

1012
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,319
By "signs of possession," would you
mean her speaking in languages...

1013
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:04,487
we might assume
she couldn't possibly know?

1014
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:07,791
And the vocalization of two
distinct voices simultaneously?

1015
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,361
Yes. Among other signs that I
observed and described to the court...

1016
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:13,463
while the tape was playing.
Things I saw.

1017
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,163
Things you can't hear
on the tape.

1018
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,267
We'll just have to take
your word, won't we?

1019
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,119
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.

1020
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,572
I apologize.
Father, as Emily's parish priest...

1021
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:25,609
are you aware that she underwent
advanced catechism training?

1022
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:27,434
Yes. Yes. Her family is very devout.

1023
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:30,947
And in that training, did she study
Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?

1024
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:32,356
Yes, I think that's right.

1025
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,852
Might have even studied Aramaic,
Christ and his disciples' language...

1026
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:39,522
which, according to the transcripts,
we also heard on the tape, correct?

1027
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:42,459
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.

1028
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:45,228
But it was offered as an elective
at her catechism school.

1029
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,265
I have the school's curriculum
here if you'd like to see it.

1030
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:52,202
No. I'll accept that she might have
been exposed to that language.

1031
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:54,277
And according to
her high school records...

1032
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,973
German was the foreign language
she studied there, yes?

1033
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,465
I don't know. If you say so.

1034
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:02,161
So that covers the strange languages
we heard on the tape, correct?

1035
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:04,802
Did I miss any?

1036
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,250
- No.
- Good.

1037
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:09,719
We've already established
you're no medical expert.

1038
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:11,253
You said it's not your field.

1039
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:15,191
But are you aware of the dual sets of
vocal cords every human possesses?

1040
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:16,641
- No.
- Have you heard of...

1041
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:21,131
the superior vocal cords, which are
higher than the ones we use to speak?

1042
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:24,000
No. So you didn't know that
Tibetan monks, for example...

1043
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:26,937
as part of their religious training,
teach themselves...

1044
01:29:27,262 --> 01:29:30,540
to activate both sets
of vocal cords at once?

1045
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,375
No, I didn't know that.

1046
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,211
Well, now that you do know,
would you think it's possible...

1047
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,180
that Emily, in her psychotic state...

1048
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:39,649
might have activated both sets
of vocal cords...

1049
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:43,253
so as to achieve the amazing effect
we heard captured on your audiotape?

1050
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:44,745
Her state was not psychotic.

1051
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,624
Father Moore, you told us
that in the exorcism we heard...

1052
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:51,227
you actually saw, once again,
this black-robed figure...

1053
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,064
or demonic apparition, am I right?
- Yes.

1054
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,866
But we couldn't see him
when you played the tape, correct?

1055
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:58,691
- No, of course not.
- Of course not.

1056
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,571
So that would be another
supernatural aspect of the exorcism...

1057
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:05,254
your tape doesn't prove, correct?
- Yes.

1058
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:08,011
Where is your dark figure, Father?

1059
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:10,513
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?

1060
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:12,638
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.

1061
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,176
I have nothing further.

1062
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,157
Does the defense wish to redirect?

1063
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:24,894
No, Your Honor, but we reserve
the right to recall the witness later.

1064
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,849
Very well.
The witness may step down.

1065
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:37,640
Your Honor, my next witness
must have been detained.

1066
01:30:37,965 --> 01:30:39,809
If we could take a short recess
so I could...

1067
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:43,480
You've made this court wait before,
counselor. I'm inclined to...

1068
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,315
Your Honor, please.

1069
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,151
Dr. Cartwright came to us
in good conscience...

1070
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:51,454
as an eyewitness to the exorcism
on Father Moore's tape.

1071
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,724
He can substantiate
all of my client's testimony...

1072
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:58,061
Your Honor, the defense has already
presented its exorcism testimony...

1073
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,846
in dramatic fashion.
Do we really have to...?

1074
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:10,753
We have absorbed some
extraordinary testimony today.

1075
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:13,877
I think we'll take some time
to consider it.

1076
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:16,764
Court is adjourned
until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

1077
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,118
- You can't find him?
- I went to meet him, he didn't show.

1078
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,320
I called his office, I called his house.

1079
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:29,175
Okay. Go to the hospital, ask around.
Somebody's gotta know where he is.

1080
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,330
What the hell happened?

1081
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,277
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.

1082
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:51,448
Tell him I know the demons are real
and I admire his courage...

1083
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:53,834
for standing and speaking
against them.

1084
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:56,905
Tell him I know what they can do.

1085
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,367
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.

1086
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:24,961
Are you drunk?

1087
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:30,168
- Not yet, but I'm working on it.
- Have you seen this?

1088
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:37,527
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...

1089
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,063
You told me you'd talk him out
of testifying.

1090
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,565
Instead, you put on a freak show
with taped demons...

1091
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,534
and a dead girl
speaking in tongues...

1092
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:48,957
and your client testifies that the
archbishop sanctioned the exorcism.

1093
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:51,841
We'll be lucky if the
archdiocese isn't named...

1094
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:54,277
I had a doctor
who was gonna corroborate.

1095
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:57,447
Besides that, Father Moore's
testimony's crucial to his defense.

1096
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,183
Did you forget the archdiocese
is paying for this defense?

1097
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:02,171
The archdiocese isn't on trial.

1098
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:06,456
I swore an oath to do
what's best for my client.

1099
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,758
Spare me the law school pieties,
Bruner.

1100
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,994
You cashed in your conscience
at the door.

1101
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:14,120
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?

1102
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,317
It's not over.

1103
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:21,704
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand...

1104
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,073
to corroborate Father Moore
about the exorcism.

1105
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:27,076
And there are the girls.
Her sister Alice, she saw part of it.

1106
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,213
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.

1107
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:31,948
Thomas will rip them to pieces.

1108
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:34,669
You'll be worse off than you are now,
if that's possible.

1109
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,439
You're gonna replace me
on this case.

1110
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,271
You've screwed it up
beyond all repair.

1111
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:43,259
But the archdiocese feels
that replacing you now...

1112
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:46,329
would only draw more
unnecessary attention to the trial.

1113
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:48,078
But just so we're clear, Bruner...

1114
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:53,021
if you put that priest
on the stand again, I will fire you.

1115
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:21,619
You've been crying.

1116
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:28,119
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?

1117
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:33,395
He was killed.
There was an accident. I'm sorry.

1118
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:38,397
I know he was your friend.

1119
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,900
We've lost.

1120
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,614
Without his testimony, it's over.

1121
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:51,361
No.

1122
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:55,898
No, no, no, it isn't over. We're telling
Emily's story. That's what matters.

1123
01:34:56,223 --> 01:34:58,468
- It can't be worth all this.
- Yes, it is worth it.

1124
01:34:58,593 --> 01:35:01,504
Just let me go back on the stand
and tell the rest of the story.

1125
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,856
- I can't do that.
- You must!

1126
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,161
You must.

1127
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:16,467
Erin, you once said that you felt
you were on the right path.

1128
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:20,604
Don't stray from that path.

1129
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,593
Here, take this.

1130
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,129
- What is this?
- Just read it.

1131
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:29,721
And then decide
what you want to do.

1132
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:36,162
I saw your eyes today in court when
I explained the significance of 3 a. m.

1133
01:35:36,998 --> 01:35:42,962
It's not going to stop
until Emily's story is told.

1134
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:26,379
Are you gonna make a statement?

1135
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,741
Do you believe it was the devil?

1136
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,907
Is the defense ready to proceed?

1137
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:49,000
Yes, Your Honor. The defense
recalls Father Richard Moore.

1138
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:59,676
The witness is reminded
that he is still under oath.

1139
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:12,335
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.

1140
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,805
Her mother, Maria, called me
and said that Emily had asked for me.

1141
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:18,624
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.

1142
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:21,431
Did Emily explain to you
the letter's significance?

1143
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:27,016
Yes. She said she'd written it the
morning after the failed exorcism...

1144
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,607
and that it was important
for me to share.

1145
01:37:33,748 --> 01:37:36,481
Father Moore,
was Emily a good person?

1146
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:43,387
I believe that one day
Emily will be recognized as a saint.

1147
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:47,290
- So she loved God.
- Yes. She was very devout.

1148
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:50,239
Father Moore, if Emily loved God...

1149
01:37:50,564 --> 01:37:53,142
if she was so good and so devout,
why do you think God...

1150
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:55,044
allowed this to happen?
- Objection.

1151
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:57,113
What is the relevance
of that question?

1152
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:59,315
Father Moore's belief
in this matter is crucial...

1153
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,518
in establishing his and Emily's
understanding of her condition.

1154
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:05,688
And that mutual understanding
is paramount in determining...

1155
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,108
whether Father Moore was,
in fact, negligent.

1156
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:12,061
I'm going to allow it.

1157
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:14,797
Your Honor, you're not really gonna
let someone testify...

1158
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:18,167
about why God would allow
the death of a young girl?

1159
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,883
The objection has been overruled.

1160
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:23,226
Again, Father Moore:

1161
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:29,259
Why did God allow Emily to become
possessed by demons and then die?

1162
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:32,030
I can let Emily answer that.

1163
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:39,522
"Last night, on Allhallows' Eve..."

1164
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:44,150
Father Moore tried to cast
six demons from my body.

1165
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:46,582
They refused to go.

1166
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,290
"After the attempted exorcism..."

1167
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:55,288
I was taken to my room,
and I fell into a deep sleep.

1168
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:02,192
I awoke a few hours later,
hearing a voice calling out my name.

1169
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:20,043
"Again, I heard a voice
calling my name.

1170
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:23,811
It was the Blessed Holy Mother
of God.

1171
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,979
And when I looked at her...

1172
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:30,819
she smiled at me and said:

1173
01:40:31,725 --> 01:40:34,770
'Emily, heaven is not blind
to your pain."'

1174
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:38,487
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her
in the middle of a field?

1175
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:41,377
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?

1176
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,502
I believe Emily spoke the truth.

1177
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:46,537
Please continue.

1178
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:53,307
"I asked the Blessed Mother,
'Why do I suffer like this?"'

1179
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,917
Why did the demons
not leave me tonight?

1180
01:40:58,485 --> 01:41:01,731
"She said, 'I am sorry, Emily."

1181
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:05,016
The demons are going to stay
where they are.'

1182
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,159
Then she said,
'You can come with me in peace...

1183
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,121
free of your bodily form...

1184
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:15,760
or you can choose
to continue this.

1185
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:19,081
You will suffer greatly.

1186
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:24,972
But through you, many will come to
see that the realm of the spirit is real.

1187
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,845
"The choice is yours."'

1188
01:41:37,825 --> 01:41:39,784
I choose to stay.

1189
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:13,754
"In the end,
good will triumph over evil."

1190
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:16,722
Through my experience...

1191
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:20,131
people will know
that demons are real.

1192
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:26,271
People say that God is dead.

1193
01:42:29,043 --> 01:42:31,411
But how can they think that...

1194
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:34,038
"if I show them the devil?"

1195
01:42:39,753 --> 01:42:43,599
Did you see these wounds on both
of Emily's hands and both feet?

1196
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:48,738
Yes. Yes, the wounds
lasted for some time.

1197
01:42:49,063 --> 01:42:53,161
And did you attach any supernatural
significance to these wounds?

1198
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:57,446
I believe they were stigmata.

1199
01:42:57,771 --> 01:42:59,615
By that, you mean
supernatural injuries...

1200
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,785
that correspond to the crucifixion
wounds of Jesus Christ?

1201
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:04,637
Yes.

1202
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:11,979
Stigmata are a sign, a mark
indicating one is touched by God.

1203
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:20,349
After that night, why do you think
Emily refused another exorcism?

1204
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,996
I believe she'd accepted her fate.

1205
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:30,460
Is there anything else
you'd like to say about Emily?

1206
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:36,107
No.

1207
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:40,840
The defense rests.

1208
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,268
Father Moore attaches
divine significance...

1209
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:56,005
to the wounds
on Emily's hands and feet.

1210
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:57,663
Why?

1211
01:43:59,133 --> 01:44:02,992
Because he sees them as confirmation
of what he wants to believe.

1212
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:07,536
That Emily was a saint,
touched by the hand of God.

1213
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:12,103
I'm afraid the truth
is far less inspiring.

1214
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:18,082
Because the truth is, by the time
these miraculous wounds appeared...

1215
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,397
Emily had already shown
a tendency to injure herself...

1216
01:44:21,722 --> 01:44:24,867
and simply did so again
on one of the barbed-wire fences...

1217
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:28,425
surrounding the Rose family farm.

1218
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:39,582
Father Moore's beliefs are based on
archaic and irrational superstition.

1219
01:44:39,907 --> 01:44:42,799
Emily suffered because she was sick...

1220
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:45,940
not because she was a saint.

1221
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:51,877
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.

1222
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:58,116
And in here,
facts are what must matter.

1223
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,928
And these are the facts of this case:

1224
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:07,029
Emily Rose had epilepsy,
which caused psychosis.

1225
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:10,913
And, given time,
medicine would have cured her.

1226
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:15,551
But it didn't. Why? Because Father
Richard Moore convinced Emily...

1227
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:20,189
that she wasn't ill,
that she didn't need medicine.

1228
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:23,192
And in the weeks
leading up to her death...

1229
01:45:23,517 --> 01:45:27,478
when she was clearly in need
of medical treatment...

1230
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:30,385
he failed to have her hospitalized.

1231
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,965
So...

1232
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:45,933
the defense has given us
an extraordinary...

1233
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:51,105
creative explanation
for the events that led to this.

1234
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:57,949
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't you believe it.

1235
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:03,355
Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil
that did this to Emily Rose.

1236
01:46:07,261 --> 01:46:08,719
It was the defendant.

1237
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:31,408
Counselor.

1238
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:40,719
Ethan Thomas calls himself
a man of faith.

1239
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,863
I, on the other hand,
am a woman of doubt.

1240
01:46:53,106 --> 01:46:55,133
Angels and demons.

1241
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:57,841
God and the devil.

1242
01:47:01,982 --> 01:47:05,249
These things either exist,
or they do not exist.

1243
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:09,683
Are we all alone in this life?

1244
01:47:10,457 --> 01:47:12,416
Or are we not alone?

1245
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:16,125
Either thought is astonishing.

1246
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:23,112
Do I really believe that this tragedy
is the work of the devil?

1247
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,100
To be honest, I don't know.

1248
01:47:26,873 --> 01:47:29,503
But I cannot deny that it's possible.

1249
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:31,954
The prosecution
wants you to believe...

1250
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:35,457
that Emily's psychotic
epileptic disorder was a fact...

1251
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:39,762
because facts leave no room
for reasonable doubt.

1252
01:47:40,087 --> 01:47:42,217
But this trial isn't about facts.

1253
01:47:43,256 --> 01:47:45,920
This trial is about possibilities.

1254
01:47:46,593 --> 01:47:49,204
Is it a fact that Emily
was a hypersensitive...

1255
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:50,906
as Dr. Adani suggests?

1256
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:56,831
A person who's more likely, by her
very nature, to become possessed?

1257
01:47:58,271 --> 01:48:02,073
I can't say that, but the question is:

1258
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:03,937
Is it possible?

1259
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:09,825
Is it a fact that Gambutrol
anesthetized Emily's brain...

1260
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:13,486
so that the exorcism ritual
was rendered ineffective?

1261
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:17,519
I can't be sure of that.

1262
01:48:20,026 --> 01:48:21,154
But is it possible?

1263
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:27,129
Is it a fact that Emily
was beloved by God?

1264
01:48:29,136 --> 01:48:32,681
And that after her exorcism,
she chose to suffer till the end...

1265
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,784
so that we might believe
in a more magical world?

1266
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:39,672
A world where the spiritual realm
really exists?

1267
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,348
I can't say that's a fact.

1268
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:45,177
But ask yourself:

1269
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:48,816
Is it possible?

1270
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:52,534
It's what Emily believed.

1271
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,436
It's what Father Moore believed.

1272
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:59,241
And that sincere belief is what
determined her choices and his.

1273
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:03,197
Now, for the most
important question:

1274
01:49:04,805 --> 01:49:07,349
Is Father Richard Moore guilty...

1275
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:11,305
beyond a reasonable doubt,
of negligent homicide?

1276
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:16,692
Did he, in fact, neglect
Emily's needs in such a way...

1277
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:19,294
that her death
is now on his hands?

1278
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:23,532
No! That is not a fact.

1279
01:49:23,857 --> 01:49:26,435
It is not a fact
that Emily was epileptic.

1280
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,039
It is not a fact
that she was psychotic.

1281
01:49:31,364 --> 01:49:32,731
Facts...

1282
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:36,732
leave no room for possibilities.

1283
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:39,548
The only fact...

1284
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:44,820
the only thing I know
beyond a doubt in this case...

1285
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:48,537
is that Father Moore
loved Emily with his whole heart.

1286
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:52,227
He did everything in his power
to help her.

1287
01:49:52,552 --> 01:49:57,185
He has risked his very freedom
so we could hear her story.

1288
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:05,774
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1289
01:50:05,999 --> 01:50:09,232
in my job I sometimes
have to defend bad men.

1290
01:50:10,737 --> 01:50:13,538
Father Richard Moore
is not one of them.

1291
01:50:16,843 --> 01:50:18,587
Don't send a good man to prison.

1292
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:21,857
I'm not asking that you believe
everything that Father Moore believes.

1293
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:25,483
I'm simply asking that you believe
in Father Moore.

1294
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:44,627
Madam Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

1295
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:46,495
We have, Your Honor.

1296
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,745
Please read the verdict out loud.

1297
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:08,403
"In the case of The People
v. Father Richard Moore..."

1298
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:11,340
we, the jury, find the defendant...

1299
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:14,466
"guilty of negligent homicide."

1300
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:18,703
The court thanks the jury
for its service.

1301
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:23,986
Sentencing for this case
will be set for April 3rd.

1302
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:26,321
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

1303
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:28,690
Father Moore requested
at the start of trial...

1304
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:31,660
that if found guilty,
he would be sentenced immediately.

1305
01:51:31,985 --> 01:51:33,795
Yes, I recall that.

1306
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:38,184
Does the prosecution have any
objection to expedited sentencing?

1307
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:40,716
Very well.

1308
01:51:44,598 --> 01:51:47,476
Father Richard Moore,
do you understand this sentence...

1309
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:50,312
which has been found against you?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1310
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:52,848
And do you understand
the gravity of this crime?

1311
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:57,519
That you may, under the law, be
sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?

1312
01:51:57,844 --> 01:51:59,021
Yes, I do.

1313
01:51:59,346 --> 01:52:01,223
Are there any statements
you wish to make...

1314
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:02,891
before I impose this sentence?

1315
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:04,960
- No, Your Honor.
- Very well.

1316
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:07,262
Excuse me, Your Honor...

1317
01:52:07,587 --> 01:52:09,831
but the jury would like to make
a recommendation...

1318
01:52:10,156 --> 01:52:11,887
regarding the sentence.
- Objection.

1319
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:13,835
Sit down, counselor.

1320
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:17,552
It's only a recommendation,
and I would like to hear it.

1321
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:22,557
We recommend a sentence
of time served.

1322
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:34,009
I'll accept that.

1323
01:52:39,152 --> 01:52:40,542
You are guilty, Father Moore.

1324
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:43,550
And you are free to go.

1325
01:52:45,025 --> 01:52:47,894
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.

1326
01:52:56,036 --> 01:52:57,233
Thank you.

1327
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:27,195
Well, you shocked us all.

1328
01:53:27,901 --> 01:53:30,178
Everyone at the firm sees this
as another victory.

1329
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:32,414
The archdiocese is pleased.

1330
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:35,484
They feel the trial has raised
public interest in the Church.

1331
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:37,419
Have you seen the news?

1332
01:53:37,744 --> 01:53:40,155
There's our priest,
leaving the courthouse a free man...

1333
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,007
right next to you.

1334
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:44,610
Just like James Van Hopper.

1335
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:48,497
All right, I'll say it. I was wrong.

1336
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,187
But I'm ready to make it right.

1337
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:53,420
I'm offering you
a full partnership in the firm.

1338
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,620
Keep it.

1339
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:25,752
Will you be able to return
to your parish?

1340
01:54:29,262 --> 01:54:30,823
I can't go back.

1341
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:32,822
Not now.

1342
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,001
Once you've looked
into the darkness...

1343
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:41,672
I think you carry it with you
for the rest of your life.

1344
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:47,503
What about you?

1345
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:52,644
I believe you've seen
the darkness too.

1346
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:57,950
I don't know.

1347
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,724
I'm not sure what I've seen.

1348
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:15,172
- Who chose the epitaph?
- I did.

1349
01:55:16,176 --> 01:55:19,944
It's from the second chapter
of Philippians, verse 12.

1350
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:24,014
Emily recited it to me
the night before she died.
