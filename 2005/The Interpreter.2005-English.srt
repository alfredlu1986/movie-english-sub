She wouldn't tell me
her husband's name.

2
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:01,242
She wouldn't even write it.

She knows not to speak
the names of the dead.

00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:08,603
Zuwanie's murdered half the town.

5
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,418
How could it get any worse?

6
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:13,671
With Zuwanie, he could
murder the other half.

7
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:34,984
No.

8
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,070
Just us, they said.

9
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:41,074
Xola's right, Philippe.

10
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:44,577
You've done well my friend.
But just us.

11
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,400
I'll do the talking.

They're Ku.

It's OK. It's OK.

The Teacher says good day to you.

16
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,366
The United Nations was born in
a hope that survived world war...

17
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:17,669
We must not allow the peace
of the world to be jeopardized.

18
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,970
Not only is this a negation
of democracy and its principles,

19
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:32,142
it constitutes interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign states.

20
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:40,693
We are presently in the throes
of a great transition

00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,362
in humankind's affairs.

22
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,991
Modern technology is
altering our world

23
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,662

- Ma'am?

27
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,383
What?

28
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:07,720
- Put it in the drawer, please.
- Step forward, please.

29
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,014
- Step through.
- Oh, man.

Peace, security and freedom

Ladies and gentlemen, we need
to take a 15-minute recess now.

42
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:14,288
We will advise you further
at the end of that time.

43
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,629
We can't use the stairs.

44
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,798
- I know a short-cut.
- What, did you design the building?

45
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,134
- I still get lost every other day.

- Come on, Roland, it's my flutes.

Don't make me drag it around.

Want to wait this out at Oz?
We can grab a sandwich.

Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.

00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:00,746
Silvia? Rudy thought he had
a flute lesson tonight.

00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:03,374
Will you call me when you get in?

Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,490
the situation in Matobo
has now become critical.

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,536
With Ajene Xola in hiding
and Kuman-Kuman in exile,

70
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:06,666
Edmond Zuwanie has few domestic obstacles

71
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,377
to his policy of ethnic cleansing.

72
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:14,507
The Security Council therefore must
press for his immediate referral

73
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:19,220
to the International Criminal
Court in The Hague.

00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:27,937
I'm Jonathan Williams, Ambassador Harris's
adviser. We need you for a few minutes.

76
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:35,737
- Which language?
- The Matoban ambassador. He'll speak Ku.

77
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:38,490
- Ku?
- You speak the language, don't you?

78
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:49,459
Let's be clear, Mr. Ambassador.

79
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,755
The United States may not recognize
the ICC as a legitimate court,

80
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:59,386
but we do not condone the methods
President Zuwanie uses against his people.

81
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,976
Dr Zuwanie is an educator.

82
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:10,147
He is... our teacher.

83
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:15,694
But his opponents engage
in ever more ferocious acts.

84
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:21,492
The partisans of both Kuman-Kuman
and Ajene Xola have become...

85
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:23,994
terrorists.

86
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:31,210
The French proposal is a
diplomatic headache for both of us.

87
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,633
- What a predicament.
- It doesn't have to be.

88
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:41,721
Dr Zuwanie wouldn't have to appear
before the International Criminal Court.

89
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:44,891
Not if he were somewhere else.

90
00:16:47,268 --> 00:16:50,480
- Do you want him to resign?
- Tell him this.

91
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:56,694
If he goes voluntarily, we're confident
the French proposal will be vetoed.

92
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:01,532
You can tell him yourself.

93
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,535
He will be here next Friday,

94
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:08,540
exercising his right to speak
before the General Assembly,

95
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:12,544
where he will announce a new
programme of democratic reform.

96
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:17,465
Perhaps then there will be no vote
and your predicament will disappear.

97
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,765
It will end here.

98
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:30,020
The Teacher will never
leave this room alive.

99
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,191
That's it. 'The Teacher will
never leave this room alive.'

100
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:35,692
Word for word.

101
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:40,072
- And what language did you say?
- Ku.

102
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,535
It's a tribal dialect of Matoban, spoken
throughout the south central African belt.

103
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:48,789
- Did you see anyone?
- No, but I think that they saw me.

104
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,126
Why didn't you report this last night?

105
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:56,296
It didn't mean anything to me at the time.

106
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:00,384
- Rather, I didn't know what it meant.
- But now you do.

107
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,553
I heard something today.

108
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,599
I don't know if I'm permitted.

109
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,767
- It was in a closed...
- You are.

110
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:12,938
In fact, you're obligated, as you
were last night when you didn't.

111
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:19,278
I think they were talking
about Edmond Zuwanie.

112
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:23,449
He's planning to come here
to address the GA.

113
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,619
Can you see her?

114
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:31,249
Turn on the light.

115
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:40,633
Call the Secret Service.

116
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,230
Bet you really miss this.
Welcome back.

117
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,817
Ma'am? Excuse me. Please
don't touch the Prime Minister.

118
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:02,072
I need you to step back, please.

120
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,206
The first of the demonstrators.

121
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:16,003
They're here to protest the appearance
later this week by Edmond Zuwanie.

122
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:19,047
Not just his political future
but any future for him

123
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:21,842
hinges on that speech
to the General Assembly.

124
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,511
Dr Zuwanie is accused of genocide,

125
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,057
but he's expected to argue that his actions
were a defensive response to terrorism

126
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:34,313
and not acts of aggression, as some
Security Council members have charged.

127
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:37,191
- Secret Service.
- Just a moment, please.

128
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,611
We're with Foreign Dignitary Protection.

129
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,115
- It's a branch of the US government.
- Dot.

130
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,994
This is international territory.
I need you to wait for an escort.

131
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,955
Zuwanie lands at 8.45 hours.

132
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:54,792
State Department says no meet-
and-greet, no shopping, no Lion King.

133
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:59,463
He leaves your podium,
his plane has two hours to clear US airspace,

134
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,549
unless the UN cancels the visit

135
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:05,720
and Tobin and I can get back
to the important work we were doing.

136
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:10,016
That's up to the GA President.
We just present a threat assessment.

137
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,852
- Why is he coming?
- To make a speech.

138
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:15,521
To escape the International
Criminal Court.

139
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:20,568
Security Council was debating whether
to bring charges of ethnic cleansing,

140
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:24,197
so he'll come, talk about
free elections and reform

141
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,200
and pray that that appeases everyone.

142
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,412
So the stakes are high.
He's not going to cancel.

143
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:34,165
Tell me about the interpreter.

144
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,130
Born here, but lived mostly
in Africa and Europe.

145
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,382
She studied music in Johannesburg

146
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:46,553
and linguistics at the Sorbonne
and various countries in Europe.

147
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:47,929
Parents?

148
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:52,601
British mother, white African father.
Moved here five years ago.

149
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,729
Interview couldn't have taken long.
She's just what they want.

150
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,899
- She is the UN.
- Can she cook?

151
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:02,778
What else do we know?
Since the initial clearance.

152
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,488
Is she married?

153
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,409
Does she have a child?
Does she belong to any clubs?

154
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:10,911
Is she registered to vote?

155
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,748
Democrat? Republican?

156
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,043
What religion is she?

157
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:21,422
Who is she?

158
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:24,467
Silvia.

159
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:40,316
Secret Service
Dignitary Protection Squad.

160
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,945
We're responsible for
visiting heads of state.

161
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,155
I don't recall seeing you around.

162
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:49,450
They hire us for our forgettable faces.

163
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,123
Is she on guard?

164
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:56,165
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:01,629
Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry
guns always sound like cowboys?

166
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:07,635
I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

167
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:09,971
But you listen to voices.

168
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:13,850
Do you think you could identify the
voice you heard if you heard it again?

169
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,188
Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

170
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:22,192
Whispers disguise
the quality of a voice.

171
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:26,154
You, I imagine, study faces.

172
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,832
- You know, I'm not really a dignitary.
- I know.

173
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:44,673
How'd you happen to be
up there after hours?

174
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:45,904
We had an evacuation.

175
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:48,218
I'd left some things in the sound
booth I had to go back for them.

176
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:51,221
And at that moment there
happened to be a couple of fellas

177
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:54,975
talking about an assassination
in a language that you and...

178
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:58,270
maybe eight other people understand,
in a room... full of microphones.

179
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,648
Do you think I'm making it up?

180
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,735
Why would I report
a threat, I didn't hear?

181
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,071
- People do.
- I don't.

182
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,824
- Some people like attention.
- I don't.

183
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:14,057
Maybe you don't want
Zuwanie to live here.

184
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:15,580
I didn't make it up.

185
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,915
How do you feel about him?

186
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:20,042
I don't care for him.

187
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:21,878
Wouldn't mind if he were dead?

188
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,254
I wouldn't mind if he were gone.

189
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:25,173
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

190
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,508
If I interpreted gone as dead,
I'd be out of a job.

191
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:30,303
If dead and gone were the
same thing, there'd be no UN.

192
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,201
Your profession is playing
with words, Ms Broome.

193
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:33,765
I don't play with words.

194
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,767
- You're doing it right now.
- No, you are.

195
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,353
If I wanted him dead,
I wouldn't have reported it.

196
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,605
I would sit back and let it happen.
It's not what I want.

197
00:23:40,814 --> 00:23:42,899
- That's not why I'm here.
- Here?

198
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:47,862
Here working at the UN, instead of standing
on a road somewhere with a machine-gun.

199
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:49,406
Because you believe in diplomacy?

200
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,055
Because I believe in this place.
I believe in what it tries to accomplish.

201
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:53,994
Well..

202
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:55,954
You've had a tough year, lady.

203
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,123
Listen.

204
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:04,171
I'm scared, and my protector is
someone who doesn't believe me.

205
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,383
You don't look scared.

206
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:11,094
People handle fear in
different ways, Mr. Keller.

207
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:13,180
It turns some people
into stand-up comedians.

208
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,599
You don't know me at all.

209
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:19,645
Maybe I should talk
to someone else about

210
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,669
assigning someone to look after me
who's better suited to the job.

211
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,817
My job... is not to look after you,

212
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:29,947
it's to look after the man who's been
threatened if there... was a threat.

213
00:24:30,197 --> 00:24:33,993
My job, as it concerns you,
is to investigate you.

214
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:38,622
So you're not here to offer me
any protection whatsoever?

215
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,000
No, ma'am.

216
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:49,550
And we were getting along so well.

217
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,929
- So what do you think?
- She's a liar.

218
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,506
Agent Keller? Morning.

219
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,779
Special Agent Lewis, FBI.
This is Agent King.

220
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,324
We're on loan.

221
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:15,535
Which means they have to be
returned in the same condition,

222
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,454
or we don't get our money back.

223
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:20,331
- Keller.
- Woods.

224
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:29,799
- Are you sure you're ready to come back?
- I'm better working.

225
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,888
- We got a credible threat?
- We should assume so.

226
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:38,183
As popular as we are in the
rest of the world these days,

227
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,977
the last thing we can afford
is to have some foreign leader

228
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,312
get popped on our soil,

229
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:45,524
and particularly a guy like
this that we don't like.

230
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:48,569
So State wants you to know:
NSA, CIA, FBI,

231
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,405
whatever you need to keep
this maniac's heart beating

232
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:54,408
till he makes his speech and
gets the hell out... it's yours.

233
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,502
Woods.

234
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:11,592
Zuwanie's head of security's arrived.
He wants a meeting right away.

235
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,720
This guy's gonna have to wait a couple
hours till we get back from Washington.

236
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,264
Guess what, he's white.
Evidently he was a Dutch mercenary.

237
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:19,100
He's still gonna have to wait.

238
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,395
It's hard to remember that Edmond
Zuwanie was once a good man.

239
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:24,730
That's not unusual for these guys.

240
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:26,857
They all begin as liberators

241
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:29,402
and 20 minutes later, they're as
corrupt as the tyrants they'd overthrown.

242
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:33,906
He liberated the country from one of
the most corrupt governments on earth,

243
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:37,389
gave the people hope,
and was a hero.

244
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,912
They need another name
for what he is now.

245
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,768
Man likes his gun.

246
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,124
And he'll have it
with him at the UN.

247
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,710
He knows they won't be putting
him through a metal detector.

248
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,128
Who are his enemies?

249
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:51,153
Aside from the thousands
of victims' relatives?

250
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,217
These two.

251
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:55,887
Both his opponents,
both want his job.

252
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:58,139
On the right, Ajene Xola.

253
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:02,936
Son of a doctor, Paris-educated,
pacifist to begin with.

254
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:03,979
Aren't they all?

255
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,939
Yeah well he managed
longer than most.

256
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,211
And the other?

257
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:09,734
The other one has two names,
he's constantly in the Post.

258
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:12,946
One name, twice.
Kuman-Kuman.

259
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:15,657
He's been yelling about
Zuwanie being a madman and

260
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:17,284
the UN not doing enough about it.

261
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:19,786
Now he's in exile in Brooklyn.

262
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:20,871
A socialist and a capitalist,

263
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:23,498
both gaining significant
strength with the people,

264
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:26,293
both with the motivation
to see Zuwanie gone.

265
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,214
- Gone?
- Dead.

266
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:33,091
But not just dead.

267
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:35,260
Dead in front of the
delegates of 191 countries

268
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,679
and every news service with a camera.

269
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:39,431
Dead in front of the world.

270
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:41,141
Nobody needs to be that dead.

271
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:46,397
In my opinion, we're wasting
tax dollars staying late.

272
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,440
It's a con.

273
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:52,674
This is the interpreter?

274
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:55,072
I need everything CIA has on her.

275
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,836
Vous voulez le Figaro,
vous savez quoi faire.

276
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:12,381
Philippe, c'est le seul numéro que j'aie.

277
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:14,571
C'est Silvia.
Il faut que je te parle.

278
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:18,221
Tu es toujours NF à l'étranger?

279
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,306
Tu peux m'appeler?

280
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:23,434
J'ai quelque chose à te demander.

281
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:28,648
Non, ne m'appelle pas.
J'essaierai de t'appeler.

282
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,447
So what do we make
of this interpreter?

283
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:40,076
Is she making it up?
Is she imagining things?

284
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,786
I'm looking for Mr. Lud.

285
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:42,829
Is she pretty?

286
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,498
I brought you a copy of her UN file.

287
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:48,418
Dr Zuwanie is not gonna
cancel his speech, you know.

288
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:52,714
That's up to the GA President,
but you might want to think about it.

289
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,551
- Ms Broome has a Matoban passport.
- Excuse me?

290
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:00,472
She was born here, she was raised
there, so she has dual citizenship.

291
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,433
Are you serious?

292
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,271
Black or white?

293
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,356
No, thank you.

294
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:13,861
- Is she black or white?
- White.

295
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,699
- Did you give her a polygraph test?
- Not yet, no.

296
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:21,160
Well, shouldn't you?

297
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,898
Hi, Ma.

298
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,152
Back off, you're too close.
Way too close.

299
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:56,404
What are you, on a date?

300
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:26,016
Hey, you got the Kellers.

301
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:28,289
We're out having a good time,
so leave a message.

302
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,834
Hey, you there?

303
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:35,088
Maybe I made a mistake.

304
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,675
You there?

305
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:40,885
Shit.

306
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:42,804
I told him I want to come back and...

307
00:31:42,908 --> 00:31:47,496
He's gonna drop me off at the
airport now, and I was wondering...

308
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,520
Anyway, you don't have to meet me.

309
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:55,483
Unless you want to.

310
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:58,737
I hope you haven't changed the locks.

311
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:12,876
If I were Roy Rogers
I'd sure enough be single...

312
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:20,509
It'd just be me and Trigger
We'd go riding through them movies

313
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:53,042
They're ready for you.

314
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:55,169
I'll be right there.

315
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:09,017
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

316
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,062
Ms Broome.

317
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:18,693
- Can I get you anything?
- How about a hood?

318
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:22,489
- I want to split that.
- When do I know the results?

319
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:26,534
Right away. You know when
you're lying, don't you?

320
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:38,380
Look straight ahead,
feet flat on the floor.

321
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:41,258
Is your name Silvia Broome?

322
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:43,718
Miss Broome?

323
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:47,055
I found out something
from our domestic Intel.

324
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:50,058
All this may have begun
with a tragic accident.

325
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:50,642
What do you mean?

326
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:53,562
Her parents had a farm
in the local mountains.

327
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,732
This area became infested
with rebels in the '80s

328
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,568
and Dr Zuwanie was
forced to mine the roads.

329
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:02,946
Her parents were bringing her
younger sister back home from school

330
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:04,198
Their rover hit a mine.

331
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:07,076
- And they were killed?
- All of them.

332
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:12,164
- How old was she?
- 12, 13.

333
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:21,298
Something like that, even years later,
could incite all kinds of ideas.

334
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:28,931
She has every reason to want
Dr Zuwanie tried at the ICC.

335
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:36,022
I'll be right back.

336
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,820
- Oh, no. Come on.
- OK, the control questions show stress,

337
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:47,492
and the key questions show stress
as well as the baseline questions.

338
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,577
Maybe we should just read her palm.

339
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:55,959
- How did I do?
- Je ne sais pas.

340
00:34:57,168 --> 00:35:00,463
Nils Lud.
Dr Zuwanie's head of security.

341
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,614
I thought since you were in a
question-answering mood,

342
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:08,263
I might ask one or two.

343
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:13,143
Might I ask where you stand
now politically, Miss Broome?

344
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:15,833
I'm for peace and quiet, Mr. Lud.
It's why I came to the UN.

345
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,440
Quiet diplomacy.

346
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:22,611
With respect, you only interpret.

347
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:27,491
Countries have gone to war because
they misinterpreted one another.

348
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:31,411
I would say she's clearly under
stress, but not necessarily lying.

349
00:35:33,872 --> 00:35:34,998
Congratulations.

350
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,417
I'm told what you heard
was a whisper.

351
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,337
Yes.

352
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,944
Is it possible that
you could identify it

353
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,758
if you ever heard it again?

354
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,345
It might be.

355
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:51,348
Tell me, do you have a brother?

356
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:56,604
I hope it's all right

357
00:35:56,604 --> 00:36:00,775
I took this opportunity to ask
Miss Broome a few questions.

358
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:05,821
You're free to go. Agent Scott
will drive you back to the UN.

359
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:12,828
Would you drive Ms Broome back
to the UN, please? Thank you.

360
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,125
- Does this mean the test was...?
- The test was inconclusive.

361
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,231
But I'd rather make the
mistake of believing her

362
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:21,671
than the bigger one of not.

363
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:24,444
The next time you wanna question
an American citizen in the offices

364
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:27,844
of the United States secret
service, you ask permission.

365
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:30,388
Hey Silvia.

366
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,223
Oh don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

367
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:33,933
Did you do something naughty?

368
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:37,187
A couple of FBIs were
asking me about you.

369
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:39,773
If you often work
later than everybody.

370
00:36:39,877 --> 00:36:43,193
Did you bring things in
after hours? Like that.

371
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:45,508
What'd you tell them?

372
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:49,470
I said... from a... sound
engineer's point of view...

373
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:51,243
You're perfect.

374
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,995
I need somebody on
the guy with two names.

375
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:54,579
Mo.

376
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:57,207
Actually it's one name twice.
Kuman-Kuman.

377
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:59,626
You volunteering,
or just correcting me?

378
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:00,627
I'm from Brooklyn.

379
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,254
You got him.
You and...?

380
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:04,277
I was on him when he first
came here from Matobo.

381
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,967
OK, you got him again.
You and Mo.

382
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:09,428
I thought she was supposed to have
perfect pitch and all that shit.

383
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:12,264
She says whispers don't
have a recognizable pitch.

384
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:15,267
NSA agrees.
They say it's very difficult.

385
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,936
- They don't know that.
- They say they do.

386
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:21,899
No, no, no. Not NSA.
Whoever she heard.

387
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:25,778
So why don't you let them keep
thinking that she can ID it?

388
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:28,259
What are you asking me to do, Jay?

389
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:31,388
Hey. I don't want any
harm to come to her.

390
00:37:31,388 --> 00:37:33,994
Matter of fact, you oughta get a place
where you can keep an eye on her but

391
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:36,997
we got three days and she's the
only link you got to these guys.

392
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:39,125
Are we using her as bait?

393
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:43,838
Just make the calls.

394
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:48,050
I'm sending you an email with an attachment.
Can you print front and back?

395
00:37:49,093 --> 00:37:52,930
Listen. I've asked INS for a list of
everyone coming in the last six months.

396
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:57,101
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo.
I'm gonna do voice samples on everyone.

397
00:37:57,351 --> 00:38:01,939
So when she hears the voice again,
she'll identify it.

398
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,110
- She said it was a whisper.
- Well, now she thinks she can do it.

399
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,032
- Photo there yet?
- It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

400
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:19,541
That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

401
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,878
Look at the crowd.

402
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,798
Look closely.

403
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,675
Any leads?

404
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:15,014
Maybe one.

405
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:17,391
Come on down to Mexico.

406
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:29,904
Is that you?

407
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:37,412
Can you tell me what somebody like you

408
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:41,207
who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

409
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:43,251
is doing at a rebel rally?

410
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:47,088
- A peace rally.
- I don't want to do this again.

411
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:51,301
It's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

412
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:53,219
After that.
After you listen.

413
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,658
You're asking the wrong question.

414
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,265
I'm asking the question that
you don't want to answer.

415
00:39:57,515 --> 00:39:58,412
Why would somebody take a picture

416
00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:02,103
and type the names of
everyone in it on the back?

417
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:05,273
This is a death list.

418
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:12,155
The question you should be asking is,
'Who gave me this and why?'

419
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:17,390
What are you not telling me?

420
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:19,288
What are you accusing me of?

421
00:40:19,538 --> 00:40:23,500
How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind 'I don't care for him'?

422
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,836
I feel disappointment.

423
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:29,715
That's a lover's word.

424
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:34,053
What about rage?

425
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:38,682
Of all the people that I've looked
into since this thing started,

426
00:40:38,932 --> 00:40:43,145
the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history... is you.

427
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:48,567
- It was his land-mines that
killed y...  - Shhhh !

428
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,238
We don't name the dead.

429
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,994
Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge on someone,

430
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:00,913
on God if they can't
find anyone else.

431
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,625
But in Africa,

432
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:08,275
in Matobo, the Ku believe
that the only way...

433
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:11,924
to end grief is to save a life.

434
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,971
If someone is murdered,

435
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:22,435
a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

436
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,480
There's an all-night party
beside a river.

437
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,483
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

438
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:30,485
He's taken out on the water
and he's dropped.

439
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:34,155
He's bound so that he can't swim.

440
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:35,907
The family of the dead then
has to make a choice.

441
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,412
or they can swim out and save him.

442
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:47,335
The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

443
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:51,882
they'll have justice but spend
the rest of their lives in mourning.

444
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:58,805
But if they save him, if they
admit that life isn't always just...

445
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,436
that very act can take
away their sorrow.

446
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:10,651
Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

447
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,749
Why do you look away?

448
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:32,256
There are some things I don't like
to talk about and you call it lying.

449
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:35,593
But not when you do it.

450
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:40,139
I'm not the one under investigation.

451
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:49,315
That was a long time ago.

452
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,817
- FBI.
- Intel.

453
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,444
- TTF.
- Sniper team.

454
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,780
Secret Service.

455
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,951
This is Nils Lud,
head of Dr Zuwanie's security.

456
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,828
Shall we take a walk?

457
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,718
How close can a vehicle
get over here on a saturday?

458
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,929
Not close enough of the barriers.

459
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,159
No garage under the GA.

460
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,100
Dog sweep every night.
It's not a bomb.

461
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,998
Has to be a rifle.

462
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,397
From where?

463
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,525
How does he get a rifle in here?

464
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,284
Could be from up close.

465
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,994
Who gets that close?

466
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,830
One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?

467
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,331
It's a good thought, but...

468
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,043
we'd much prefer to kill him
back home alone than here

469
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,377
with all of you gentlemen watching.

470
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,588
It's already here.

471
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,801
If these guys know what they're
doing, the weapon is already here.

472
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,700
Hello?

473
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,620
Hello, Philippe? Hello?

474
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:30,646
No prints on the door and
negative for latex dust.

475
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:33,148
- Nothing on the door?
- No.

476
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,945
- No forced entry.
- Did Doug not see him?

477
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:41,469
No, he missed it. Some lady crossed
the street, called 911, saw the guy.

478
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:44,744
Hey. Go easy on him, okay?
He feels terrible.

479
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:52,001
On the roof. He must have gone over
the roof to get to the next building.

480
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,503
I couldn't see the fire escape,
it's on the other side.

481
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:56,589
Give me that.

482
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:00,134
You mean you screwed up.

483
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:02,845
I mean I screwed up.

484
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,931
So did I.

485
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:09,769
I need Polaroids of that,
inside and out.

486
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,191
- You okay?
- Great.

487
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:18,444
- Who else has a key to
this apartment?  - No one.

488
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:21,698
- You don't keep a spare
outside somewhere?  - No.

489
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,908
- No one else has a key...
- Nobody.

490
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,703
- The door wasn't forced.
- They can't pick locks?

491
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:30,290
They can. We can tell.
They didn't.

492
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,626
- Where do you keep your key?
- In my purse.

493
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,648
That purse hasn't been out
of your sight all day?

494
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:35,837
No.

495
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,344
Yes.

496
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:45,013
In my locker.

497
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:46,536
Dot. Wake up Rory,

498
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,811
have him dust her locker and
those beside it before morning.

499
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,939
So you were just having a quiet evening,

500
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:57,359
some gentleman in a mask
waves to you from your fire escape.

501
00:46:57,568 --> 00:47:00,154
That's about it, yeah.

502
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:06,702
Dot?

503
00:47:08,746 --> 00:47:11,916
Is there anything special
about this mask?

504
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,751
I'll be honest with you...

505
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:16,003
I don't know how honest
I can be with you.

506
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:21,258
My brother gave it to me.

507
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:26,097
I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

508
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:33,271
We've... lost touch for a while,
but... we're close.

509
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:39,444
Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy too?

510
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:41,612
He's more into lists.

511
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:47,035
Farm kids will do anything to
amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

512
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:51,623
I read. My brother kept lists.

513
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:54,083
Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

514
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:57,253
Times and dates that
Mum used the F-word.

515
00:47:57,462 --> 00:48:01,257
Countries with advantageous
male to female ratios.

516
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:03,927
Odd animal facts.

517
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:07,430
Did you know the leading cause of
death for beavers is falling trees?

518
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:11,059
- Yes.
- You did not.

519
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:16,314
He had a notebook for words that he liked.

520
00:48:16,565 --> 00:48:20,110
Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

521
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,364
Could he be involved in this?

522
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:33,123
We're stuck, aren't we, you and I?

523
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,919
We're kepéla.

524
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:39,880
It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

525
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:47,388
You got to give me a reason
to get to the other side.

526
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:33,726
Just wait a second.

527
00:49:42,736 --> 00:49:44,654
OK.

528
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:57,834
There's a blue and white outside.
NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

529
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:01,838
And then?

530
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:06,802
We'll figure something out.

531
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,220
Thank you.

532
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:29,783
My wife was killed two weeks ago.

533
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:36,499
She... she'd left me.

534
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:43,923
She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

535
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:46,634
She was going to come back this time.

536
00:50:46,884 --> 00:50:48,886
She said.

537
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:57,395
She was a dancer.

538
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,067
The guy was a dancer, too.

539
00:51:04,777 --> 00:51:05,820
Eddie.

540
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,784
Great dancer.

541
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,994
Lousy driver.

542
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:17,540
The only way he knew
how to stop a car

543
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:21,252
was to slam it into a bridge
abutment in Santa Fe.

544
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:27,092
So there was no taking
her back this time.

545
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:36,476
The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

546
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:42,816
I think I would have let him drown.

547
00:51:46,528 --> 00:51:50,240
I might have even held
his head under the water.

548
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:59,249
Not a very Ku thing to do.

549
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:12,680
If you need anything, you can call
the precinct or just go downstairs.

550
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:23,566
This is my cell number.

551
00:52:26,986 --> 00:52:29,363
It's the same card.

552
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,995
Goodnight.

553
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:40,667
Lock this.

554
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:46,673
It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

555
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:54,848
We got a clear view.
Front door's just 50 seconds away.

556
00:52:55,098 --> 00:52:58,226
- I'll take the first shift.
- Who's babysitting Kuman? Lewis and Clark?

557
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:00,896
Lewis and King.
He'll be in bed in an hour.

558
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:04,274
FBI's right. Guy does
the same routine every day.

559
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:09,821
Somebody call me if she gets
another trick-or-treater. I'm off.

560
00:53:11,615 --> 00:53:13,742
Sweet dreams, partner.

561
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:20,374
the belief that the individual
needs of people

562
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:24,628
are paramount to its purpose,
and with it goes the assumption

563
00:53:24,878 --> 00:53:29,758
that human rights are fundamental
to human prosperity and development.

564
00:53:30,884 --> 00:53:35,055
They cannot be separated.
They can only be said to exist...

565
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:38,392
You got one shot. You sever the brain stem,
creating paralysis,

566
00:53:38,642 --> 00:53:43,355
you drop the perpetrator without reflex action.
He can't activate a detonator. Thank you.

567
00:53:45,816 --> 00:53:51,113
If you have to issue a verbal warning,
you get very close before you do so.

568
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:54,116
No. There won't be time for a second one.

569
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:57,411
Whatever the weapon is,
consider this a suicide bomber.

570
00:53:57,662 --> 00:53:59,830
There's no profile for a suicide bomber.

571
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:04,710
This could be nine or 90, male or female,
a PhD or a dropout.

572
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:08,423
The only thing they have in common
is they are not afraid to die.

573
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:11,572
Which means this is either
a fanatic for a cause

574
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:13,803
or someone who has
nothing to live for.

575
00:54:14,012 --> 00:54:18,349
We'll run two teams. DDO calls the decoy exit
30 seconds before the intersection.

576
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,481
NYPD snipers from these two buildings here,
our guys sniper the bridge.

577
00:54:24,689 --> 00:54:28,234
Her locker was clean.
The others were covered with prints.

578
00:54:28,485 --> 00:54:32,238
Someone wiped hers. We're looking
at a janitor or a maintenance worker.

579
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:34,282
Or another interpreter.

580
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:51,008
So when do we do this voice line-up?

581
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:53,844
We're not doing that any more.

582
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:57,514
- She says she can't.
- Can't what?

583
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:02,644
ID the voice. She thought she could, now
she thinks she can't. She's sure she can't.

584
00:55:02,895 --> 00:55:08,025
She can't because she can't, or because
she never heard anything to start with?

585
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:17,535
- He says he wasn't here... I think.
- Not according to this.

586
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:27,503
- He traded shifts with someone. Com quem?
- Jamal.

587
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:31,507
Jad Jamal. He's in Crown Heights.

588
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:51,194
Afternoon. Secret Service.
Need to talk to Jad Jamal.

589
00:55:56,491 --> 00:56:00,411
- Does this guy live here?
- No, no here. With lady.

590
00:56:00,662 --> 00:56:04,040
You got lady's number?

591
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,584
Does he have a cell phone?

592
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:11,756
OK, we'll be back. If he shows up before that,
have him give us a call.

593
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:36,573
- Hello?
- Silvia, c'est moi. Philippe.

594
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:38,700
Philippe.

595
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:42,704
- Going out.
- I got her.

596
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:53,883
- Shit.
- Shit.

597
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:27,125
Oh, come on.

598
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:44,976
Philippe.

599
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:00,367
- What is it?
- I've done a terrible thing.

600
00:58:00,617 --> 00:58:02,619
- It is Simon.
- No, listen.

601
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:07,457
Someone contacted me.
One of Kuman's people...

602
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:12,421
I thought it was one of his people...
to arrange a meeting with Xola.

603
00:58:12,671 --> 00:58:16,967
They said it was time to admit that
only together could they stop Zuwanie.

604
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:19,428
- What happened?
- So I arrange it.

605
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:23,223
But it was a trap.

606
00:58:26,852 --> 00:58:28,312
Xola's dead.

607
00:58:35,236 --> 00:58:37,613
I knew it.

608
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:39,782
I knew he was dead.

609
00:58:43,202 --> 00:58:45,788
Was my brother there?

610
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,835
No, Simon wasn't there. Only Xola.

611
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:56,424
I stayed in the car. No one came back out.

612
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:01,095
- Where is he? Where's my brother?
- I don't know.

613
00:59:02,513 --> 00:59:05,808
- You think Kuman has him?
- I don't know what to think.

614
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:11,564
Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell.
How did it get to be like this?

615
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:16,277
You see what I did? I took Xola right to them.

616
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:20,782
- You didn't know.
- Forgive me.

617
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:27,581
- I was only trying to help.
- There's nothing to forgive.

618
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:30,709
Yes, there is.

619
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:33,044
- I have to go.
- Philippe.

620
00:59:44,306 --> 00:59:49,728
You cannot do that. How the hell do I
protect you if I don't know where you are?

621
00:59:49,978 --> 00:59:53,232
You emphatically told me that you weren't.

622
00:59:53,482 --> 00:59:59,029
That was before you had a man in a mask
on your fire escape.

623
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:04,118
I've had a 24-hour shift of agents
across the street.

624
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:09,081
Who was that in the park?

625
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:13,502
- It's personal.
- We're past that. What's his name?

626
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:14,879
It's not your business.

627
01:00:15,129 --> 01:00:18,674
Is he the one you e-mailed
before reporting the threat?

628
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:25,514
'Where are you?
I'm worried about you. Write me.'

629
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:28,851
'Please. I need to know you're OK'?

630
01:00:30,686 --> 01:00:32,939
Worried why? Because he's involved?

631
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:38,986
Is that him, here, now, in my country,
making threats? That is my business.

632
01:00:39,237 --> 01:00:42,365
You're wrong. It's got nothing to do with you.

633
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:26,577
I'll take care of you.

634
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:43,594
- I'm going to Starbucks. Want anything?
- Just what I need, another night without sleep.

635
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:46,347
I'm good. Thanks.

636
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,060
What's up with Common Kuman?

637
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,813
- Brushing his teeth.
- I gotta talk to him.

638
01:01:54,063 --> 01:01:58,359
Café Atlantic, noon to two, then
the Nava Club for a steam and massage.

639
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:01,988
- Coffee?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

640
01:02:05,908 --> 01:02:09,162
She can't sleep either. Just turned the TV on.

641
01:02:10,288 --> 01:02:12,290
Probably PBS.

642
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:16,794
- Where you going?
- You're here with your bag.

643
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:19,964
I can go home and get a good night's sleep.

644
01:02:22,008 --> 01:02:24,010
Unless you want me to stay.

645
01:02:26,387 --> 01:02:27,805
No. Thanks.

646
01:02:28,097 --> 01:02:31,518
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

647
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:36,690
United Nations, New York. Protests
erupted here following an announcement

648
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,361
that President Edmond Zuwanie
will address the General Assembly Friday.

649
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:45,615
The exiled leader Kuman-Kuman
rallied today's protesters.

650
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:48,785
He would be more convincing
if he were assassinated.

651
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:50,579
He doesn't even have to die.

652
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:53,582
An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility,

653
01:02:53,832 --> 01:02:57,336
he can do anything he wants...
and stick around to enjoy it.

654
01:02:57,586 --> 01:03:02,257
Security is on heightened alert
in response to anonymous threats...

655
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:08,055
- Keller.
- I'm sorry.

656
01:03:09,306 --> 01:03:12,017
I really didn't know
you were watching me...

657
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:17,189
or I wouldn't have just...
left like that.

658
01:03:19,149 --> 01:03:23,112
- You want to tell me what happened?
- I had to meet someone.

659
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:28,576
- Philippe Broullet.
- If you knew, why did you ask?

660
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:32,788
I know his name, I know he's
a photographer for a French magazine.

661
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,001
- He needed to talk to me.
- Now you're watching TV, unable to sleep.

662
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:39,837
- What did he say?
- How do you know I'm...?

663
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:42,256
Are you over there?

664
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:50,264
Jesus.

665
01:03:55,687 --> 01:03:58,690
He told me we lost a friend.

666
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:03,361
He lost a friend.
I... lost someone I loved once.

667
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:07,365
It was a long time ago.

668
01:04:10,702 --> 01:04:12,412
You can't sleep either.

669
01:04:13,705 --> 01:04:15,749
I don't know why I'm calling you.

670
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:19,920
- What do you do when you can't sleep?
- I stay awake.

671
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:28,595
You don't name the dead, you said. Why?

672
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:32,182
What... what happens?

673
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,813
You move past them. You leave them behind.

674
01:04:38,897 --> 01:04:42,818
You can do that,
but you have to be ready to let them go.

675
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,820
To move on.

676
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,742
You've been going through hell.

677
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:51,535
Keeping busy.

678
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:57,833
You, too, I think. I don't know all of it, but...

679
01:05:06,926 --> 01:05:10,054
Are you going to be there until morning?

680
01:05:10,304 --> 01:05:12,348
It almost is morning.

681
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:15,810
Yeah, I'll be here.

682
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:21,023
Is it OK if I just try to fall asleep
over the phone?

683
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:28,990
That's fine.

684
01:05:48,593 --> 01:05:50,178
Goodnight.

685
01:06:02,023 --> 01:06:03,859
She's coming your way.

686
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:10,657
Oh, no. No scooter, please.
Come on, no scooter.

687
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,243
Yes. Thank you, God.

688
01:06:24,338 --> 01:06:27,508
You might as well drive me.
We're going to Brooklyn.

689
01:06:29,343 --> 01:06:31,387
Corner of Bergen and Nostrand.

690
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:36,058
Jad Jamal. Worked the interpreters' lounge
the day the mask showed up.

691
01:06:36,308 --> 01:06:39,770
- Bring him to me.
- Can't. He didn't show up for work.

692
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,939
- Sit on his apartment.
- Doug's there.

693
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,525
Hey. Got the INS files.

694
01:06:55,494 --> 01:07:00,291
- This isn't the way it's supposed to be done.
- You can let me off up here.

695
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:22,897
She's at the corner of Bergen
and Nostrand in Brooklyn.

696
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:26,359
- She's where?
- My guy's on the move.

697
01:07:28,862 --> 01:07:30,989
She's here, whether I brought her or not.

698
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:33,700
- Go back. What's she doing?
- Waiting for something.

699
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,328
- Holy shit.
- What?

700
01:07:36,578 --> 01:07:38,830
The janitor. Jad Jamal.

701
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,667
- That's not him.
- I know. That's his room-mate.

702
01:07:53,971 --> 01:07:55,931
Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

703
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:58,809
His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

704
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:02,438
- Should I stay here?
- No, you stick with the room-mate.

705
01:08:02,688 --> 01:08:05,607
- Are we working on a warrant?
- Lewis is.

706
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:08,110
- How are you?
- I got something for you.

707
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,113
OK, bless you.

708
01:08:47,817 --> 01:08:49,068
Tobin?

709
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:01,623
- What's up?
- I don't know, but it don't feel good.

710
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:07,253
- What are they doing?
- Just standing there.

711
01:09:14,386 --> 01:09:16,388
We're getting on the el.

712
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:32,237
- Shit.
- She just got on the bus with Kuman.

713
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:35,908
What the hell is she doing?

714
01:09:47,711 --> 01:09:49,838
Did I hear home?

715
01:09:51,549 --> 01:09:55,261
- Or was I wrong, then?
- No, you're right. I'm Matoban.

716
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,888
And a fair Matoban, in fact.

717
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,727
King, you stay with that bus.

718
01:10:06,272 --> 01:10:08,774
Do you know who I am?

719
01:10:08,983 --> 01:10:10,026
Yes.

720
01:10:11,861 --> 01:10:15,448
You're a killer.
You ordered the murder of Ajene Xola.

721
01:10:23,623 --> 01:10:27,502
You got a red light in that car?
Why don't you use it?

722
01:10:27,752 --> 01:10:32,048
- Who told you this nonsense?
- Where's my brother?

723
01:10:32,298 --> 01:10:35,135
Your brother? I don't even know who you are.

724
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:40,598
You are on the wrong bus, so to speak,
to be so reckless.

725
01:10:48,857 --> 01:10:52,402
Your people arranged a meeting
through Philippe Broullet.

726
01:10:52,652 --> 01:10:56,281
- You know him.
- I don't... and I didn't.

727
01:10:56,531 --> 01:11:01,286
But the fact is, somebody wants you
to believe that I killed Ajene Xola.

728
01:11:02,412 --> 01:11:07,376
- I don't believe you.
- But you should believe me.

729
01:11:07,626 --> 01:11:10,796
- Why?
- Because I would form a coalition with Xola.

730
01:11:11,713 --> 01:11:14,967
Neither of us have made
enough progress alone.

731
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:18,345
He has the working people.
I have the finances.

732
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:24,101
If he is dead, it is a loss
for all of us. Me especially.

733
01:11:24,351 --> 01:11:26,562
We're getting off.

734
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:32,568
I got the back room.

735
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:39,575
Jesus.

736
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,912
Clear the other room.

737
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:57,427
OK.

738
01:11:57,677 --> 01:12:00,346
- Closet.
- Yeah. I got the bed.

739
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:17,363
Ho! Keller?

740
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:23,495
- We got a dead body in the closet.
- Jamal?

741
01:12:23,745 --> 01:12:28,333
Yeah. I'll call it in.
God, how can you see in here?

742
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:30,335
Wait. Wait.

743
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:37,384
Why the lanterns?

744
01:12:41,096 --> 01:12:43,181
Well, that's just rude.

745
01:13:05,913 --> 01:13:10,501
- What do you do so far away from home?
- I work. And I hope.

746
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:14,171
- Same as me, then.
- I doubt it.

747
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:20,052
You work for...?

748
01:13:20,303 --> 01:13:23,222
I'm an interpreter at the UN.

749
01:13:23,514 --> 01:13:27,602
So like the UN. Layers of
languages signifying nothing.

750
01:13:27,852 --> 01:13:30,605
- You'd prefer more war?
- I prefer more business.

751
01:13:30,855 --> 01:13:33,608
Guys, get with me here.
We got a situation.

752
01:13:33,858 --> 01:13:39,072
No, boss, we got a situation.
We just got on the 133. With Mohammad.

753
01:13:39,322 --> 01:13:42,825
And Silvia Broome.
And Kuman-Kuman.

754
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:45,495
- What?
- You're on the same bus?

755
01:13:45,703 --> 01:13:47,288
With our subjects.

756
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:51,126
Get off the bus,
and get Silvia Broome off that bus now.

757
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:53,753
We can't do that.
We're moving.

758
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,298
Doug, is the room-mate carrying anything?

759
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:05,265
- Doug, is he carrying anything?
- A satchel.

760
01:14:06,892 --> 01:14:12,064
- All right... where is it?
- It's in his lap. He's been carrying it all day.

761
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:15,609
- Oh, man.
- Can either of you get to him?

762
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:20,489
Not without gettin' made.

763
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:24,243
Despite all the flags on First Avenue,
there are no nations any more.

764
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:30,290
Only companies. International companies.
It's where we are. It's what we are.

765
01:14:33,877 --> 01:14:36,005
I think you're wrong.

766
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:39,633
You are still young.
I'm an acquired taste.

767
01:14:42,261 --> 01:14:44,638
What's your brother's name?

768
01:14:46,932 --> 01:14:50,519
Simon. Simon Broome.

769
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:54,690
- OK, we're stopping.
- You got guts, coming out here.

770
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,030
I'll see what my people
can find out about him.

771
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:06,285
But remember, I'm not
your brother's keeper, eh?

772
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,621
Yeah. Thank you.

773
01:15:10,456 --> 01:15:13,376
Come on, guys, talk to me.
What's going on?

774
01:15:13,626 --> 01:15:16,212
We're stopped.
She's getting off.

775
01:15:18,798 --> 01:15:22,886
- What's going on?
- And so is my subject.

776
01:15:24,095 --> 01:15:28,933
Keep talking to me. What's going on?
Is he carrying the satchel?

777
01:15:29,142 --> 01:15:32,187
OK, he's got the satchel.
But I think he made me.

778
01:15:32,437 --> 01:15:33,813
That's OK, I got him.

779
01:15:35,482 --> 01:15:37,484
- Kuman?
- He's staying put.

780
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:39,903
Miss Broome! Please get in the car.

781
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,532
Move it!

782
01:15:43,782 --> 01:15:45,826
- I got Gamba.
- I'll stay with Kuman.

783
01:15:46,076 --> 01:15:50,872
No. Just get off that bus.
Get everybody off that bus right now!

784
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,003
- Doug!
- Mohammad?

785
01:15:57,713 --> 01:16:00,966
- Hey! Guy forgot his lunch.
- Oh, man.

786
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:24,865
I'm standing here on Nostrand
Avenue in Crown Heights,

787
01:16:25,116 --> 01:16:28,619
at a scene that can only be described
as unconscionable carnage.

788
01:16:28,869 --> 01:16:32,790
frantically helping victims
of an apparent terrorist attack.

789
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,752
These events are more familiar
in the cities of the Middle East.

790
01:16:37,003 --> 01:16:41,299
There is no word yet. However,
there are unconfirmed reports

791
01:16:41,549 --> 01:16:46,345
that Kuman-Kuman, the exiled Matoban
revolutionary, may have been on board.

792
01:16:46,554 --> 01:16:48,598
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

793
01:16:48,848 --> 01:16:51,434
Doug?

794
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:01,194
This is Ron Ferguson, reporting live
on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn,

795
01:17:01,402 --> 01:17:04,405
where just after 10.30 am this morning...

796
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,372
We're OK, boss.

797
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:19,296
the violence has now found its way
into the heart of New York City...

798
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:24,342
- The death toll is 17, with scores injured...
- The obvious speculation about al-Qaeda...

799
01:17:24,593 --> 01:17:27,596
widely seen as the probable
successor to Edmond Zuwanie...

800
01:17:27,846 --> 01:17:30,557
Tunnels and bridges will
close for at least 12 hours...

801
01:17:30,807 --> 01:17:33,477
alleged terrorist attack by Ajene Xola...

802
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:37,689
Zuwanie is still planning to address
the General Assembly of the UN.

803
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:50,661
What were you doing on that bus?

804
01:17:51,787 --> 01:17:54,623
Thank you for bringing me home.

805
01:18:03,966 --> 01:18:06,218
Hey!

806
01:18:08,637 --> 01:18:11,599
I lost a man today. A kid.

807
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,355
- How do you know Kuman?
- I never met him before.

808
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:21,192
You think that not getting caught
in a lie is the same as the truth!

809
01:18:21,442 --> 01:18:24,570
- I'm not lying. I went to him for help.
- With what?

810
01:18:24,821 --> 01:18:27,740
I can't tell you.
Someone might get hurt.

811
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:32,245
'Someone might get hurt.'
There's a bus full of dead people!

812
01:18:32,495 --> 01:18:35,623
'Someone might get hurt'?
Who? Someone you know?

813
01:18:35,874 --> 01:18:39,460
Someone who's mixed up in all this?
You? Why did you leave Africa?

814
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:42,797
- I told you.
- No, you didn't. Why did you come here?

815
01:18:43,006 --> 01:18:45,091
- Stop it.
- Goddammit!

816
01:18:45,341 --> 01:18:47,218
- Stop shouting at me!
- Stop lying!

817
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:49,095
- I'm not lying!
- Stop lying!

818
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:54,643
I was just on that bus! I can't think with
all this noise. I can't! You have to stop!

819
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:18,959
That isn't me.

820
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:21,003
Don't be ridiculous.

821
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:25,549
- It isn't me.
- No, that is you.

822
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:28,177
And I know, because I drive you home,

823
01:19:28,427 --> 01:19:33,599
and I look at you through the binoculars,
and everything else that I shouldn't do.

824
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:40,940
It was once.

825
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:43,192
It's not any more.

826
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:50,199
After the rallies, after my
parents and sister were killed,

827
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:52,785
then the rifles came out.

828
01:19:54,412 --> 01:19:58,291
It was the only way to get anyone
to listen. Just to listen.

829
01:20:02,086 --> 01:20:07,592
I killed a boy who had nothing to live for
beyond the money he'd get for killing me.

830
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:12,513
I shot him in the head
so he wouldn't shoot me.

831
01:20:17,852 --> 01:20:22,023
Then I handed the rifle to my brother
and told him, 'I'm through.'

832
01:20:22,273 --> 01:20:26,903
I walked away with him shouting at me,
'You're a coward.'

833
01:20:27,112 --> 01:20:30,282
'Our parents are dead, Zuwanie's alive.'

834
01:20:32,617 --> 01:20:36,746
My brother, who in another life
wouldn't harm a...

835
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:44,087
That was the last thing
he ever said to me.

836
01:20:44,296 --> 01:20:48,634
The only contact I have is the notebooks
I send and imagine him receiving.

837
01:20:48,884 --> 01:20:51,553
I know he's alive.
I know it.

838
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:55,224
But I'm not to him.

839
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:02,981
I lied to you because I was afraid.

840
01:21:04,108 --> 01:21:07,319
I was afraid he might be
involved in what I heard.

841
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:14,326
I lied to everyone else so
they'd let me near the UN,

842
01:21:14,577 --> 01:21:19,498
and that's the only place that I believe
has a chance to change any of this.

843
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:24,003
And I lied to you about
Ajene Xola because...

844
01:21:24,253 --> 01:21:26,964
I loved him. Once.

845
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:31,552
Until the color of my skin
became a problem.

846
01:21:31,802 --> 01:21:34,013
The politics of my skin.

847
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:42,522
I walked away from Africa with nothing.
No brother, no family, no lover, nothing.

848
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:47,860
Just a belief that words and
compassion are the better way.

849
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:51,865
Even if it's slower than a gun.

850
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,418
Where are you going?

851
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,213
You've got blood all over your face.

852
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:10,759
You can't say stuff like that
with blood on your face.

853
01:23:56,616 --> 01:24:00,037
This is precisely why Dr. Zuwanie
must be allowed to speak.

854
01:24:02,748 --> 01:24:05,709
This monstrous act of terrorism
was aimed at you...

855
01:24:08,462 --> 01:24:11,089
and at the heart of the United Nations.

856
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:14,968
- I can't listen to this.
- Do not allow them to intimidate you...

857
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,388
or Dr. Zuwanie.

858
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,016
I'm not at liberty to tell you.

859
01:24:28,858 --> 01:24:32,153
- Where we going?
- Bathroom.

860
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:39,160
Keller.

861
01:24:59,889 --> 01:25:03,059
Get this processed and
back to me right away.

862
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:36,093
Did he leave a note?

863
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:43,850
Did you read it?

864
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:46,353
Of course you did.

865
01:25:49,898 --> 01:25:52,901
Would you read it to me, please?

866
01:26:02,953 --> 01:26:08,584
Dear Silvia, I came to tell you
something and then didn't.

867
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:13,839
I wanted to, but when I saw you
I couldn't find the words.

868
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:20,680
I told you I didn't know where
Simon is. That was a lie.

869
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:24,350
He was there that day.
A young boy shot him.

870
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:31,566
I couldn't tell you because I'm
a coward. Simon was braver than me.

871
01:26:31,816 --> 01:26:34,444
You're braver than me.
I'm so sorry.

872
01:26:34,652 --> 01:26:37,071
I'm so sorry.

873
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:42,869
The second time was me.

874
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:01,263
I feel like my friends must feel
when they try to say something.

875
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:07,227
- It's all right.
- That's what I say to them.

876
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,784
He left this with the note.

877
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:33,545
The only thing that I wanted...

878
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:43,264
besides having her back...

879
01:27:43,514 --> 01:27:45,683
was to be left alone.

880
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:17,776
My bonnie lies over the ocean

881
01:29:24,825 --> 01:29:26,660
Don't cry.

882
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:31,874
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

883
01:29:32,124 --> 01:29:34,794
- You don't have to cry.
- I'm not.

884
01:29:35,044 --> 01:29:38,589
Because I'm here,
and I won't leave. I promise.

885
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:43,219
Look at me. I'll take care of you.

886
01:29:44,929 --> 01:29:47,598
We'll take care of each other.

887
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,353
I'll take care of you.

888
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:09,746
Promise me.

889
01:30:16,336 --> 01:30:18,463
I promise.

890
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:39,526
I promise.

891
01:33:06,259 --> 01:33:09,721
Xola's dead. Kuman's dead.

892
01:33:12,015 --> 01:33:14,058
Who do you work for?

893
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:19,314
- Don't touch.
- Those things'll kill you.

894
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,380
Russell!

895
01:34:26,132 --> 01:34:27,091
Hey!

896
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:32,722
- What the hell's going on?
- Close the door!

897
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,437
Silvia!

898
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,149
Silvia!

899
01:35:13,013 --> 01:35:14,681
Silvia!

900
01:35:16,516 --> 01:35:18,602
Keller!

901
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:20,145
Keller!

902
01:35:25,651 --> 01:35:28,904
She's not here. Check the roof.

903
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,214
Jay?

904
01:35:50,468 --> 01:35:54,263
- Dot, what have you got?
- There was something on her credit card.

905
01:35:54,513 --> 01:35:58,309
His name is Jean Gamba.
He's our bomber.

906
01:36:00,186 --> 01:36:03,356
- And our assassin?
- That would be good for us.

907
01:36:03,564 --> 01:36:05,191
But I doubt it.

908
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:07,026
He tried to kill her.

909
01:36:07,235 --> 01:36:10,363
- What happened?
- I shot him.

910
01:36:12,198 --> 01:36:15,785
That's a pity.
He might have told us something.

911
01:36:16,035 --> 01:36:18,830
- And Miss Broome?
- Gone.

912
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:24,085
- He killed her?
- She was gone before he got there.

913
01:36:27,964 --> 01:36:31,050
- Mind if I take a look upstairs?
- Hold on. Dino?

914
01:36:31,259 --> 01:36:35,347
- Yeah.
- Take Mr. Lud to the apartment. And Brian?

915
01:36:35,597 --> 01:36:41,019
- Get NYPD to push their tapeline...
- Keller? Go home and get some sleep.

916
01:36:41,269 --> 01:36:43,855
- I'm gonna wait for her.
- Like hell you are.

917
01:36:44,105 --> 01:36:48,860
I need you awake tomorrow morning.
Woods? Get him home.

918
01:36:54,616 --> 01:36:58,996
- Drive around the block.
- You heard Jay. I gotta take you home.

919
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:04,626
What if there were two guys? Three?
We just set the trap and run? Is that it?

920
01:37:05,627 --> 01:37:09,465
They're not our family
and they're not our friends.

921
01:37:09,715 --> 01:37:11,341
You told me that.

922
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:16,597
You lose somebody, you lose somebody.
I don't want to lose two somebodys.

923
01:37:20,476 --> 01:37:23,521
One circle, then I'm taking you home.

924
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:48,629
Hello? Are you there?

925
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:55,511
I'm fine. I'm all right, but I...

926
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,473
I can't talk to you.

927
01:37:58,681 --> 01:38:03,269
You were right. My brother...
my brother was right.

928
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,815
It takes too long, Tobin.
I'm going home.

929
01:38:32,883 --> 01:38:33,842
Keller.

930
01:38:34,092 --> 01:38:37,846
Keller, Lewis. Those numbers
scribbled on Jamal's kitchen wall.

931
01:38:38,055 --> 01:38:42,351
Ray's Pizza, some sex lines,
a hardware store and a global cell phone.

932
01:38:42,559 --> 01:38:44,269
Chase down the global cell.

933
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,438
- Keller, it's Mo.
- Go ahead, Mo.

934
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,857
She booked a flight online.

935
01:38:49,066 --> 01:38:52,820
Check all flights to South Africa
out of JFK, LaGuardia and Newark.

936
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:55,364
And then what? If I find her.

937
01:38:58,867 --> 01:39:00,995
Get her on the phone with me.

938
01:39:07,168 --> 01:39:09,003
He's here.

939
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,902
That's him?

940
01:39:35,488 --> 01:39:36,531
Second car.

941
01:39:57,969 --> 01:40:01,723
Keller? Lewis. The global cell
belongs to Jean Gamba.

942
01:40:01,973 --> 01:40:04,142
- Got the times of the calls?
- Yeah.

943
01:40:04,392 --> 01:40:07,270
Day before yesterday, 3.30 pm.
Anything there?

944
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:11,024
- Day before yesterday, 3.30?
- 3.30, yeah.

945
01:40:11,274 --> 01:40:13,735
Call it. No, have Lewis call.

946
01:40:13,986 --> 01:40:15,821
- I'm Lewis.
- Clark, I mean.

947
01:40:16,071 --> 01:40:18,824
- No, King. And he's dialing.
- Extension 647.

948
01:40:19,074 --> 01:40:22,077
The bus. Right after.
I want to know who he called.

949
01:40:22,327 --> 01:40:26,081
It's King. It's the Matoban
mission. An extension.

950
01:40:28,417 --> 01:40:32,671
- Lud?
- No, someone named Marcus Matu.

951
01:40:32,921 --> 01:40:35,549
Head over.
I need a face for that name.

952
01:41:03,035 --> 01:41:04,787
She's booked 9 am, JFK.

953
01:41:05,037 --> 01:41:08,499
- I'm on the LIE. Almost there.
- Call me from the gate.

954
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:45,495
Not as much sky as I remember,
but more skyscrapers.

955
01:41:45,746 --> 01:41:49,416
23 years, Dr. Zuwanie. Things change.

956
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:51,251
They diminish.

957
01:41:53,086 --> 01:41:55,297
Desire diminishes.

958
01:41:56,423 --> 01:42:00,385
- Where is the Second Avenue?
- Just after we get off the bridge.

959
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:04,556
They decorated the bridge.

960
01:42:04,765 --> 01:42:09,895
When I came here before, they lined
the bridge with flowers, welcoming me.

961
01:42:10,145 --> 01:42:12,606
- That flight departs from gate one.
- Thank you.

962
01:42:12,856 --> 01:42:17,611
- No sign of her. Hasn't checked in yet.
- Let me know when it's boarding.

963
01:42:17,862 --> 01:42:21,031
Can we hold 'em in the safe room
to buy time?

964
01:42:21,282 --> 01:42:23,951
You can try, but it's up to him.

965
01:42:28,122 --> 01:42:32,335
There was a parade.
Right here on this Second Avenue.

966
01:42:32,585 --> 01:42:35,004
There was a snowstorm of confetti.

967
01:42:50,228 --> 01:42:51,646
Murderer!

968
01:42:56,276 --> 01:42:58,111
This is Second Avenue, sir.

969
01:43:10,749 --> 01:43:13,168
- Are you at the mission?
- Yeah, but he isn't.

970
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:17,589
- Nobody knows where he is.
- They know, they just won't tell us.

971
01:43:17,839 --> 01:43:19,591
- You get a photo ID?
- Yeah.

972
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:23,261
Go back inside
and fax that to UN security now.

973
01:43:23,512 --> 01:43:26,014
Get his address and get over there.

974
01:43:26,264 --> 01:43:28,225
I've got eight minutes.

975
01:44:01,842 --> 01:44:03,177
Keep it tight.

976
01:44:21,237 --> 01:44:23,239
Agent Keller!

977
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:41,174
He's here. I just saw him.
Broadcast that description.

978
01:44:57,274 --> 01:45:00,569
49th... 42nd.

979
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:03,655
Good. Next.

980
01:45:03,905 --> 01:45:06,241
Move on.

981
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:20,297
There it is.

982
01:45:29,932 --> 01:45:32,434
- OK.
- All right, go.

983
01:45:37,982 --> 01:45:40,943
- Levels, please.
- Un, deux, trois...

984
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:57,126
Ladies and gentlemen,

985
01:45:57,126 --> 01:46:00,380
British Airways flight 178 to
Johannesburg is ready to close.

986
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:03,424
Please make your way to gate
one immediately. Thank you.

987
01:46:03,675 --> 01:46:08,888
Thank you. Levels, please.

988
01:46:51,723 --> 01:46:57,646
The Assembly will first hear an address
by the President of the Republic of Matobo.

989
01:46:57,896 --> 01:47:00,190
On behalf of the General Assembly,

990
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:03,068
I have the honor to welcome
to the United Nations

991
01:47:03,319 --> 01:47:08,616
His Excellency Dr. Edmond Zuwanie,
President of the Republic of Matobo,

992
01:47:08,866 --> 01:47:12,161
and to invite him
to address the Assembly.

993
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:27,176
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General.

994
01:47:27,426 --> 01:47:30,304
Today my beloved country is under siege.

995
01:47:30,555 --> 01:47:33,516
As you saw the other afternoon
across the river in Brooklyn,

996
01:47:33,766 --> 01:47:36,936
the terrorists in my country
will stop at nothing.

997
01:47:37,186 --> 01:47:41,357
How am I to defend my country
against enemies like these?

998
01:47:41,608 --> 01:47:45,028
- I admit I have dealt harshly
with terrorists. - Tobin, it's King.

999
01:47:45,278 --> 01:47:47,864
- as we all will have to.
- I don't think Matu's here.

1000
01:47:48,114 --> 01:47:51,910
Remember the profile of suicide bombers
and how there isn't one?

1001
01:47:52,118 --> 01:47:54,788
who know the evil
and violence of real terrorism...

1002
01:47:55,038 --> 01:47:58,291
Your mother and sister
will get their cheque on Monday.

1003
01:47:58,541 --> 01:48:01,878
- This isn't his apartment.
- You did well.

1004
01:48:02,128 --> 01:48:05,215
No one here will live long.
It's an AIDS hospice.

1005
01:48:05,465 --> 01:48:10,512
- with a reciprocal and immediate violence...
- My opinion? It's a con.

1006
01:48:10,762 --> 01:48:13,140
I have been forced to do this.

1007
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:17,811
It is the hope and specific goal
of my administration

1008
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:22,316
- to reform these brutal methods...
- Get him off the podium.

1009
01:48:22,566 --> 01:48:26,320
- To participate in the formation...
- We've got to go.

1010
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:28,655
But I want to speak!

1011
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:40,042
Come on, sir, run!

1012
01:48:59,979 --> 01:49:01,564
He's OK.

1013
01:49:01,814 --> 01:49:04,192
- Cover here. I'll take the hall.
- Where's Keller?

1014
01:49:04,442 --> 01:49:05,860
Freeze!

1015
01:49:17,038 --> 01:49:20,416
Incredible.
Thank God I looked up.

1016
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:23,086
- He's from our mission.
- I know. Holster your weapon.

1017
01:49:25,547 --> 01:49:27,841
Dr. Zuwanie.

1018
01:49:29,217 --> 01:49:31,261
I remember the last time
you were here.

1019
01:49:31,553 --> 01:49:37,183
- Use the 42nd Street exit.
- We almost had an assassination here.

1020
01:49:37,392 --> 01:49:39,019
Please move...

1021
01:49:39,227 --> 01:49:42,772
We watched you
on the telly back home.

1022
01:49:43,064 --> 01:49:47,652
My family. All the families.
You were like the Beatles.

1023
01:49:47,903 --> 01:49:52,074
Two or three more seconds,
he would have assassinated him.

1024
01:49:52,324 --> 01:49:55,494
An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility

1025
01:49:55,744 --> 01:49:59,623
so he can stay in power and
gets to stick around to enjoy it.

1026
01:49:59,873 --> 01:50:02,626
We were so proud of you.

1027
01:50:04,628 --> 01:50:08,590
There you were, speaking to the world.

1028
01:50:11,677 --> 01:50:14,263
I don't think you should touch...

1029
01:50:16,098 --> 01:50:18,058
Because I'm not wearing a glove?

1030
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:21,061
What is your name, child?

1031
01:50:23,272 --> 01:50:25,608
I'm the Silvia whose family you killed.

1032
01:50:27,443 --> 01:50:30,279
- What's in your hand?
- It's... Just a precaution.

1033
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:35,159
What's in your hand?
He must've been very surprised.

1034
01:50:35,409 --> 01:50:37,620
He thought it was a live round.

1035
01:50:40,039 --> 01:50:42,959
- Where is everyone?
- But you knew better.

1036
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:54,095
Give me the live round.

1037
01:50:56,973 --> 01:51:02,228
I grew up seeing you with this gun.
It's the gun you saved our country with.

1038
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:04,814
- Drop the gun!
- Put it down!

1039
01:51:05,064 --> 01:51:07,233
Keller, US Secret Service.

1040
01:51:08,151 --> 01:51:11,446
It's the same one
you used to kill it.

1041
01:51:11,655 --> 01:51:15,575
- He's got a Glock on his hip.
- Code 100 in the sound room.

1042
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:25,001
Look at it.

1043
01:51:30,007 --> 01:51:31,341
Look at it!

1044
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:40,684
- Careful. The bleeder had AIDS.
- There's no way you can prove this.

1045
01:51:40,976 --> 01:51:43,896
You'll cop a plea.
You're just an employee, right?

1046
01:51:44,146 --> 01:51:46,315
He's in custody.
They're bringing him down.

1047
01:51:46,336 --> 01:51:48,400
SWAT team's at 42nd Street.

1048
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,071
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Where's Zuwanie?

1049
01:51:52,321 --> 01:51:54,949
- The safe room. What happened?
- It was a fake.

1050
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:57,284
A piece of theatre to justify
the killing.

1051
01:51:57,284 --> 01:51:59,370
Ethnic cleansing, genocide.

1052
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:02,832
You there? That's the flight.
She's not on it.

1053
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,584
I checked every hotel
in New York, her friends.

1054
01:52:05,835 --> 01:52:08,796
They don't know where she'd go.
No one knows her.

1055
01:52:09,046 --> 01:52:12,174
- I know her.
- OK, where is she?

1056
01:52:12,383 --> 01:52:15,553
- She said she was going home.
- I'm going home...

1057
01:52:15,803 --> 01:52:17,138
What home?

1058
01:52:17,388 --> 01:52:21,309
- How'd you happen to be there after hours?
- An evacuation. I left some things.

1059
01:52:21,559 --> 01:52:24,395
It takes too long...
I wouldn't mind if he were gone.

1060
01:52:24,645 --> 01:52:27,065
She's here. She's been
in that room all night.

1061
01:52:27,315 --> 01:52:31,569
How could someone so good, so...

1062
01:52:32,737 --> 01:52:35,365
How could you give us so much,

1063
01:52:36,533 --> 01:52:37,909
so much...

1064
01:52:39,911 --> 01:52:41,955
then take away more?

1065
01:52:43,415 --> 01:52:46,543
- He in there?
- Yeah.

1066
01:52:48,545 --> 01:52:50,839
Keep everybody out.

1067
01:52:51,923 --> 01:52:53,925
Silvia?

1068
01:52:54,217 --> 01:52:55,385
Silvia?

1069
01:52:57,095 --> 01:52:59,347
It's me.

1070
01:52:59,598 --> 01:53:02,517
I'm coming in alone. I'm coming in.

1071
01:53:04,352 --> 01:53:06,480
Five minutes.

1072
01:53:11,109 --> 01:53:13,779
Close it.

1073
01:53:14,029 --> 01:53:17,741
- Close it!
- Silvia, don't do this.

1074
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:19,660
It was all just theatre,

1075
01:53:19,764 --> 01:53:22,371
an almost-assassination meant
to justify his acts.

1076
01:53:22,621 --> 01:53:26,083
- We've got all we need to prosecute.
- I have him.

1077
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:29,795
- He'll die in prison.
- I want him to die how Simon died.

1078
01:53:30,087 --> 01:53:33,632
That'll be over in two seconds,
and you'll have all your years.

1079
01:53:33,883 --> 01:53:37,720
Sir, it's a lot worse than you think.
Your so-called assassin is dead.

1080
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:40,514
Your head of security is making a deal.

1081
01:53:40,765 --> 01:53:44,685
We have Lud and the rifle.
You'll be tried before two courts.

1082
01:53:44,977 --> 01:53:47,855
- He's been tried!
- Sir, you're finished.

1083
01:53:48,105 --> 01:53:53,319
- It doesn't matter!
- Silvia. Listen to me.

1084
01:53:53,569 --> 01:53:56,197
I told you I'd let him drown.

1085
01:53:56,447 --> 01:53:59,700
The man who drove my wife
into a bridge abutment.

1086
01:54:01,911 --> 01:54:04,831
- But I wouldn't.
- Then you'd be wrong.

1087
01:54:05,081 --> 01:54:07,208
No, I wouldn't be wrong.

1088
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:09,961
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in mourning.

1089
01:54:21,514 --> 01:54:24,184
You have to get out of here.

1090
01:54:24,434 --> 01:54:27,854
I can't do that.
So put the gun down.

1091
01:54:28,939 --> 01:54:32,317
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Put it down.

1092
01:54:32,609 --> 01:54:35,904
I can't! I can't... I can't.

1093
01:54:36,613 --> 01:54:38,281
Just go.

1094
01:54:52,671 --> 01:54:55,007
This is how it's done.

1095
01:55:03,223 --> 01:55:05,643
This is how you put a gun down.

1096
01:55:16,904 --> 01:55:18,697
Please.

1097
01:55:20,908 --> 01:55:24,286
You shoot him, he'll be dead...

1098
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:29,417
but then you'll be dead...

1099
01:55:31,627 --> 01:55:34,380
and I don't know what I'll be.

1100
01:55:40,094 --> 01:55:42,221
Put it down.

1101
01:55:45,224 --> 01:55:47,101
Read it!

1102
01:55:48,269 --> 01:55:49,938
Read it.

1103
01:55:51,105 --> 01:55:54,192
- Where?
- The beginning. Read it.

1104
01:56:01,032 --> 01:56:05,453
- 'The gunfire around us...'
- Louder. Like when you wrote it.

1105
01:56:06,746 --> 01:56:09,583
When you believed it.

1106
01:56:09,791 --> 01:56:11,835
When you meant it.

1107
01:56:16,965 --> 01:56:22,554
'The gunfire around us
makes it hard to hear.'

1108
01:56:24,973 --> 01:56:30,896
'But the human voice is
different from other sounds.'

1109
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:40,114
- 'It can be heard...
- 'It can be heard over...

1110
01:56:40,406 --> 01:56:45,244
- over noises that bury
everything else.' - 'Even...'

1111
01:56:46,912 --> 01:56:50,875
- 'Even...'
- 'Even when it's not shouting.'

1112
01:56:51,167 --> 01:56:53,544
'Shouting.'
'Even when it...'

1113
01:56:53,794 --> 01:56:57,631
'Even if it's just a whisper.'

1114
01:57:02,386 --> 01:57:08,309
'Even the lowest whisper
can be heard over armies...'

1115
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,103
'When...'

1116
01:57:13,272 --> 01:57:17,694
- 'When...'
- 'when it's telling the truth.'

1117
01:57:36,463 --> 01:57:39,090
That little boy was my country.

1118
01:58:26,013 --> 01:58:27,515
Hove Vambi...

1119
01:58:29,934 --> 01:58:32,311
killed by land-mines.

1120
01:58:33,229 --> 01:58:35,064
Alexander Mungoshi...

1121
01:58:36,607 --> 01:58:38,484
Charles Kufomo...

1122
01:58:40,069 --> 01:58:42,071
Ruth Kufomo...

1123
01:58:44,532 --> 01:58:47,577
shot to death defending their home.

1124
01:58:49,704 --> 01:58:51,122
Robert Chenjari...

1125
01:58:51,873 --> 01:58:53,708
Benita Matkudzi...

1126
01:58:55,585 --> 01:58:59,297
burned to death
during a protest rally.

1127
01:59:00,423 --> 01:59:02,091
Edgar Sakuro...

1128
01:59:03,593 --> 01:59:05,512
Masumi Bamcha...

1129
01:59:06,804 --> 01:59:09,265
John Enkumo...

1130
01:59:09,474 --> 01:59:11,976
Yvon Enkumo...

1131
01:59:12,268 --> 01:59:15,188
- Let the record show...
- Steven Gawanda...

1132
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:18,692
- that the Security Council...
- Solo Gawanda...

1133
01:59:18,942 --> 01:59:22,112
- has unanimously commanded...
- Steven Shamere...

1134
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:27,367
- that President Zuwanie of Matobo...
- Stambuli Watiku... Esther Tikembu...

1135
01:59:27,617 --> 01:59:32,789
be tried at the International
Criminal Court in The Hague

1136
01:59:32,998 --> 01:59:35,792
for crimes against humanity.

1137
01:59:38,754 --> 01:59:41,048
Simon Broome...

1138
01:59:41,298 --> 01:59:45,344
shot to death in a soccer stadium.

1139
02:00:18,544 --> 02:00:20,421
How did you make out?

1140
02:00:20,671 --> 02:00:23,841
They said you told them
I wasn't a danger.

1141
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:27,678
- I lied.
- Thank you.

1142
02:00:28,805 --> 02:00:31,224
They didn't believe you.

1143
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:37,730
They're sending me back.
I wanted to say goodbye.

1144
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:42,986
It's OK. I'm going home.

1145
02:00:46,406 --> 02:00:48,241
We never...

1146
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:51,870
I never had time to tell you
how much I miss Africa.

1147
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:56,499
We never had time
for a lot of things.

1148
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:04,883
You don't have anyone
left there, do you?

1149
02:01:05,175 --> 02:01:07,511
No, it's where I remember them.

1150
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:14,726
Ever been to Africa?

1151
02:01:16,687 --> 02:01:18,897
Lot of airports, no lions.

1152
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:29,241
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

1153
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:32,786
Wow.

1154
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:40,461
Hey, look at this.
We're not kepéla any more.

1155
02:01:43,047 --> 02:01:45,382
We're on the same side.

1156
02:01:47,468 --> 02:01:51,430
You never know who you're
going to meet, do you?

1157
02:01:51,722 --> 02:01:53,432
No.

1158
02:01:56,477 --> 02:01:58,646
Will you let me know how you are?

1159
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:10,742
You'll always know.

1160
02:02:25,507 --> 02:02:27,384
What was her name?

1161
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:33,640
Laurie.

1162
02:02:35,183 --> 02:02:36,977
Keller.

1163
02:02:41,148 --> 02:02:44,860
Killed in an auto accident
in Santa Fe...

1164
02:02:46,194 --> 02:02:48,155
23 days ago.

1165
02:03:00,876 --> 02:03:03,003
Rest in peace?

1166
02:03:05,881 --> 02:03:07,591
Close enough.
