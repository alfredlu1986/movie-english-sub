1
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,127
- Ah, sequels.
- Uh?

2
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,757
Only time I gave in, but sometimes you
gotta do it the studio way.

3
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,176
- What are you talking about, Get Lost?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,635
I thought the first one
was pretty good.

5
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,638
- Get Leo?
- Terrific picture. Terrific.

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,141
You know what else? It was good.

7
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,684
You know what I'm thinking, Tommy?

8
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,313
I'm thinking of getting out of the movie
business, go back to my old job.

9
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,817
- What? Being a shylock? Why?
- They're honest about being dishonest.

10
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:14,490
Come on. Why would you wanna leave
all this? Hey! Hello! Hey!

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,327
See? I'm telling you, this town...
Look, Chil...

12
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,414
You and me, we come out to Hollywood,
sniff the air,

13
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,708
and look at us, we made it.

14
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,128
And you know why? 'Cause we knew
how to hustle a deal.

15
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,672
Like I got hustled into
doing the sequel.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,341
That sucks.

17
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,010
You know that unless you're willing
to use the R rating,

18
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,428
you can only say the
F-word once.

19
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,139
- You're kidding me?
- Know what I say?

20
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,017
Fuck that. I'm done.

21
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,521
Before you skate out of the business,
I got a movie for ya.

22
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,358
- Oh, yeah? What?
- About NTL.

23
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,943
What's NTL?

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,862
"What's NTL?"
What, are you joking?

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,198
- No.
- You're pulling my chain.

26
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,202
Nothing To Lose Records.
It's like "the" indie label.

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,164
I sign bands, I produce their albums,
I sell the distribution to the majors.

28
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,959
- Now you wanna make movies.
- Yeah, who doesn't?

29
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,545
All right. Can you pitch it
in 25 words or less?

30
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,505
I can do it in one word: me!

31
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,049
- You?
- Me! Hello! Me.

32
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,301
I couldn't get your mother
to watch that movie.

33
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,846
My life in the music business.
Come on!

34
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,015
Gangsta rappers and the Russian Mafia.

35
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:26,061
You know? All that goddamn payola crap.
This place is like the Wild, Wild West.

36
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,898
You're dodging bullets,
taking arrows, and it's got a girl.

37
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,985
- There always is.
- Her name's Linda Moon.

38
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,279
She plays a girl
who wants to make it big in the biz

39
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,031
and I am the record mogul
who makes it happen.

40
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,575
It's a musical

41
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,620
and Linda's been trying to get me
ever since she saw you on Charlie Rose,

42
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,832
where you were very smooth,
and found out I knew you.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,128
I said you would help her out, and she
left you on the list at The Viper Room,

44
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,462
expecting you to show up.

45
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,590
So tell me, how's your wife?

46
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,343
Edie? Who gives a shit?
Don't be a buzzkill.

47
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,597
Hey, wh-wh-where are you going?

48
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,932
I gotta go to the men's.
I just had two ice teas.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,518
But how 'bout... Hey, Chili,
how does the movie sound?

50
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,769
You don't have a movie yet.

51
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,398
You've got a premise and setting but
you don't have character arcs or a plot.

52
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,276
OK, but still, you know...

53
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,778
Hey, who's gonna play me?
Think about that.

54
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,572
How about Carrot Top?

55
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,284
Hmm.

56
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,109
Ugh.

57
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,488
- Hey, Marla. Long time no see.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,073
How's organized crime treating you?

59
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,284
- More exciting now you're in town.
- Oh yeah?

60
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,828
So, we've got reason to believe
this was a mob hit.

61
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,831
Trust me,
if this were a mob hit,

62
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,958
they'd have hired a man
who knew how to shoot.

63
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,129
- He hit him in the chest.
- Finally. After he shot up my caddy.

64
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,547
What a shame.

65
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,133
Can you confirm that this fella
was wearing a toupee?

66
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,719
Stevie Wonder could confirm
he was wearing a toupee.

67
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,638
Mmm... So, out of the blue,
this Mr. Athens just decides

68
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,974
to look up your number
and give you a call?

69
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,810
I know what you're getting at.
You think I set him up.

70
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,604
The truth is, Tommy wanted me
to do a movie about him.

71
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,732
But you can't do a movie
where the main character

72
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,151
gets popped in the first scene, can you?

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,445
Mmm, yeah, well it's not a bad opening.

74
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,240
You know, you're right.
That worked forAmerican Beauty.

75
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,369
- Mm-hm. Sunset Boulevard.
- Or Casino.

76
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,499
Mr. Palmer, I'm Glenn
from Thrifty Executive Fleet.

77
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,128
- May I escort you to your vehicle?
- But of course.

78
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,464
Marla, Detective.

79
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,848
There you go, sir.

80
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,771
What's that? I asked for a Cadillac.

81
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,024
The Insight is the Cadillac
of gas-electric hybrid cars.

82
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,277
Not only is it fuel-efficient,
it's great for the environment.

83
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,556
- I got it.
- Thanks.

84
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,560
- Hey.
- Hey, Martin.

85
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,355
- Chili! How you doing, Chil?
- Good to see you.

86
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:43,402
- Good to see you. You know Hy Gordon?
- What's up, Chili Palmer!

87
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,153
He did the soundtrack
for Get Lost.

88
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,696
What's up, man?

89
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,031
Sorry.

90
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,659
Hy's taking me around,
I'm doing a little research.

91
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,869
For my next part. I'm gonna play Johnny.

92
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,624
The Man in Black.
"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."

93
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,169
Oh, Johnny Cash.
But he's like six feet something.

94
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,505
That's OK. You know, low angles.

95
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,758
Ha! You know, the movies?

96
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,677
Hey, Chili, is that your car?

97
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,097
Yeah, it's an Insight.
It's the Cadillac of hybrids.

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,141
It's a little tight
for a big guy like you.

99
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,435
Small price to pay
for the environment.

100
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,855
- 57 miles to the gallon.
- What about speed?

101
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,817
Ah, Martin, if you're important,
people will wait.

102
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,283
- That's true.
- You know what I'm saying?

103
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,786
You have to let it go...

104
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,206
- Linda.
- Yo. I ain't selling that.

105
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,876
Hey, sexy. You better go
put your Chick shit back on.

106
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,295
You made these people out here
pay to come see this shit.

107
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,880
Just give me one second.

108
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,426
I told you to put your clothes on.

109
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,178
- I can't.
- Did I not tell you that?

110
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,931
- Look!
- Don't "look" me again.

111
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,979
- Mr. Palmer?
- Call me Chili.

112
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,022
It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.

113
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,650
- Thank you.
- Please have a seat.

114
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,112
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I have something coming.

115
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,740
- So, Tommy's gone, huh?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,076
I can't believe it.

117
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,871
I guess this means
you're not doing the movie?

118
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,458
I gotta be honest with you, Linda.
I'm getting out of the movie business.

119
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,835
Here you go.

120
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,509
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired of this, Mr. Palmer.

121
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,013
If I could get some cash,
I would buy my way out of my contract

122
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,015
and get out of music.

123
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,102
Are you kidding? After what I just saw?
Why would you do that?

124
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,979
'Cause it sucks.

125
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,774
I could do the same thing topless
and make $2,000 a week with tips.

126
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,359
Why don't you do that?

127
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,195
I'm Baptist.
My father wouldn't approve.

128
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,907
So, then, you're like Aretha Franklin,
you learned to sing in church?

129
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,869
I learned from my father.

130
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,497
My dad was in a jazz band.
Nothing big, though.

131
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,918
See, everything I know about music,
I learned from him.

132
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:35,425
I always thought we'd play together,
but then he died, so...

133
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,595
Yo, Linda! Yo!

134
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,724
I ain't dismissed you.
You're on my time.

135
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,560
That's my manager, Raji,
with Miss Bangkok.

136
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,776
I told them I wanna quit and he's like,
"You quit me, I'm gonna jack you up."

137
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,574
- He talks like that?
- He thinks he's black.

138
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,868
His real name is Roger Lowenthal.

139
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,414
He's partners with this guy named Nick
Carr. He's this music promoter.

140
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:11,086
- Oh. I know Nicky.
- They caught me off the bus from Texas.

141
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,673
Said they'd make me this big star,
and like a fool I believed them.

142
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,427
Yo, Linda! When you're done turnin'
tricks, get your ass back over here.

143
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,263
I ain't done with you yet.

144
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,769
Look, I can't do five more years,
not with these guys.

145
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,105
Who's the big guy?

146
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,524
That's Elliot Wilhelm, Raji's bodyguard.

147
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,445
He's got this thing that he can raise
one eyebrow, give you that look.

148
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,698
He wants to be in movies.

149
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,783
That's it? He just does
the one eyebrow?

150
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,618
As far as I know,
he's gay too.

151
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,290
Word is he once threw a guy out of a
30-story building for calling him a fag.

152
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,419
- He must have been mad.
- Yo, Linda!

153
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,879
If you didn't blow all your energy
banging tourists,

154
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,550
your voice wouldn't sound so flat.

155
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,346
Girl got a flat voice,
you know what I'm saying?

156
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,392
Yeah, that one was for me,
so just relax.

157
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,062
You're gonna end up doing
50-cent lap dances like Miss Bangkok.

158
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,983
Chil, wait. You don't know these guys.
They're bad guys.

159
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,402
Trust me, Linda. I know 'em
a whole lot better than you do.

160
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,238
..ass-popping up and down a pole.

161
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,283
You'll be up at that place
going pop, pop, pop. Pop, pop, pop...

162
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,162
- What are you gonna say?
- Nothing more than I have to, if that.

163
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,457
Ass-popping. Snap, crackle, pop!

164
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,125
Chili, wait.

165
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,592
Man in a suit.
You in town for some kind of convention?

166
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,846
No, but if I was, you'd be
the man to see. Am I right?

167
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,141
Why would you say
something stupid like that?

168
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,853
Well, the way you're dressed,
you're either a pimp or a limo driver.

169
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,358
You gotjokes? You some kind
ofweak-assed comedian?

170
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,862
- Raji, look at me.
- I'm looking at you, man.

171
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,698
You say you're looking at me,
but are you really looking at me?

172
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,870
I'm really looking at you.

173
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,372
You got something stupid to say, say it.

174
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,874
So I can be done with you.

175
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,587
- Linda's quit. She's out of the Chicks.
- She's got five years on her contract.

176
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,088
I just cancelled it.

177
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,966
You walkin' out the door?
Who are you supposed to be?

178
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,429
I'm the one setting you straight.
I'm Linda's new manager.

179
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,889
Come on, honey.

180
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,308
- Elliot, light his ass up.
- Got it.

181
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,561
You're Elliot Wilhelm. You're an actor.

182
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,565
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. Chili Palmer.

183
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,527
I'm a producer. I did the film Get Leo.
Do you remember that?

184
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,903
Yeah, it's great to meet you.

185
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,697
I walk into a club
and I see a guy like you and I say,

186
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,076
"He's got the look, but does he
have the talent? Can he act?"

187
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,787
Watch this.

188
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,874
Oh, oh!

189
00:13:55,876 --> 00:14:00,421
Elliot. Elliot! Elliot!
Goddammit, what you doing, man? What?

190
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,264
- Breathe. Up, up. You OK?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,224
You can do better than him.

192
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,270
Send me some pictures, I'll give you
a call, set you up for an audition.

193
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,313
I'm at the Will Smith building.

194
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,817
- Linda, you'd better talk to me.
- Good day.

195
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,570
Oh, it's like that, huh? OK.

196
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,989
OK.

197
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,204
I got an audition, Raj.
I need to get my headshots.

198
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,938
Edie?

199
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,390
Edie?

200
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,520
Chili?

201
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,730
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

202
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,065
Oh, man!

203
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,026
I'm so glad you came.

204
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,820
I'm sorry. If there's anything
I can do...

205
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:53,534
- Thanks.
- So how are you doing?

206
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,037
You know.

207
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,044
- You were right there when it happened.
- Well, I was in the men's.

208
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,382
But you were with him
in his last hour, right?

209
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,549
Mm-hm.

210
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,387
I, um...

211
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,264
I've had him cremated
and, um...

212
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,101
I wanted to do something special
with his ashes, you know?

213
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,396
Maybe something he'd like.
You got any ideas?

214
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,399
Well, nothing that makes sense.

215
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,650
Huh.

216
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:33,074
Say, Edie, is that
an Aerosmith tattoo on your back?

217
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:38,579
Mm-hm. Yeah. You know
I followed them on tour, right?

218
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,249
- I didn't know that.
- I thought Joe Perry was so hot.

219
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,375
Yeah?

220
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:47,046
- So you were a groupie?
- No, much worse. I did their laundry.

221
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,631
They travel with their own
washer and dryer.

222
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,800
I did everything except
Steven's stage clothes.

223
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,552
He likes to send those out.

224
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,140
So, Edie, I was thinking,
you know, maybe I, uh...

225
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,517
Maybe I could help you out
with NTL Records.

226
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,021
What makes you think I need your help?

227
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,275
- Eh... Nothing.
- Look, Chili...

228
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:13,072
Let me tell you something.
I started NTL with Tommy.

229
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,532
- Right.
- Equal partners.

230
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,658
Yeah.

231
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,162
Who do you think found
the Dub MD's? I did.

232
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,208
Tommy's gone, and I'm devastated,
but I'm not about to roll over.

233
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,671
- I can run my own label.
- If anybody could, it's you.

234
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,427
Edie, why don't you get your clothes on
and let's get outta here, OK?

235
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,930
It'll make you feel better.
I wanna talk to you about Linda Moon.

236
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,516
- Linda Moon?
- Yeah, she's a singer.

237
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,893
Put this on.

238
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,192
You know, I never made it
with any of those guys from Aerosmith.

239
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,486
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-mm.

240
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,864
I played tennis
with Tom Hamilton once, though.

241
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,201
Christ...

242
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:03,331
- I was just a girl then.
- Edie, you'll always be a girl.

243
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,425
Oh, Chil. Thank you.

244
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:20,098
- Who's this?
- That's Tiffany, Tommy's intern.

245
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,558
- Hey.
- How you doin'? What's that?

246
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,812
- Pizza.
- He means the urn, genius.

247
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,190
Oh. Tommy.

248
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,861
The cops came by NTL last night.
They were asking me about you.

249
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,488
Oh yeah? What'd you say?

250
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,199
Nothin'. Just that you were gonna
make a movie about Tommy.

251
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,702
- It'd have to be a short.
- They take anything?

252
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,163
Mmm, Some boxes, a few files.

253
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,416
Ooh, but I think what they
were looking for was this.

254
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,545
Oh, thanks.

255
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,257
Here.

256
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,344
- Where'd you get this?
- Some guy with a Russian accent.

257
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,470
It's NTL.

258
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,474
A month ago he starts coming by,
looking for Tommy.

259
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,769
Tommy's in the office,
what, three hours a week?

260
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,564
So this last time he takes a picture.

261
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,859
He comes in, doesn't even ask for Tommy,

262
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:17,864
lights it on fire
and just tosses it on my desk.

263
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,366
No questions, no nothing.

264
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,911
Two days later he comes back.
This time Tommy's in.

265
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,664
So I interrupt his meeting and buzz him.

266
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,292
He comes flying out of his office,

267
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,295
walks up to the guy
and nails him right in the eye.

268
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,134
Hey, just like that scene in Get Leo.

269
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,262
Then he tosses the guy on his ass
right in the middle of the street.

270
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,931
I'm like,
"Tommy, who the hell was that?"

271
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,143
Insurance salesman. OK.

272
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,438
An insurance salesman.

273
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,608
Insurance scam. Jeez, even I know that.

274
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,820
Guy takes a picture, says either you
pay up or he puts your place on fire.

275
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,948
You know, Edie, that was Tommy's
specialty in Brooklyn.

276
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,241
He sold protection.

277
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,411
He could write a book
on the different ways to work it.

278
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,457
- Did this guy have a toupee?
- Not after Tommy hit him.

279
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,674
Good morning. Carosell Entertainment.

280
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,469
Did you see
the Chicks International?

281
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,055
I think these girls are gonna be
the next big act to break.

282
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,431
Take my word for this.

283
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,976
- What's up, Nick?
- I'm telling you, it was Linda Moon.

284
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,146
Is she a G-string diva or what?
They give you wood?

285
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,773
What's up?
I need to talk to you, Nick.

286
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,192
Give me mahogany.
Goddamn tique.

287
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,445
You could deck the QE2
with the wood they gave me.

288
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,947
Who even cares if they can sing?

289
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,990
Look, man, Chili Palmer
came in the club...

290
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,450
You're still my bitch. Love you, out.

291
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,954
- We gotta talk about this Chili Palmer.
- Robin, who's on three?

292
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,333
- Robert's on three. Marty's on four.
- Don't be...

293
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,004
- Marty, you pimp. Make me smile.
- Nick, Nick, for real.

294
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,342
- I'm serious. I need to talk to you.
- No, no.

295
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,095
- Nick!
- Marty, hold on a sec, will you?

296
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,681
What do you want?

297
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,308
It says in the paper that
Chili Palmer used to be a gangster.

298
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,687
- He was a hired hand.
- You know him?

299
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,189
Tell me what you want, Raj.

300
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,401
Linda Moon says she's gonna leave
and have Chili Palmer be her manager.

301
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,028
- She told you that?
- He told me that.

302
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,196
What'd you do?

303
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,782
Told him she's got five years
on her contract, you know.

304
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,869
You feel you had to explain it to him?
You didn't kick his ass?

305
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,872
He hit Elliot right in the damn throat.
He broke him smooth down.

306
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,625
Wow. What a surprise.
Elliot's a faggot.

307
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,043
Pussy.

308
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,713
You think it's cool
to have a queer for a bodyguard?

309
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,922
What good is he?

310
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,342
Chili Palmer's no manager,
he's a talker.

311
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,219
You should have hit him in the mouth.

312
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,223
What he does is make movies about
shylocks, 'cause that's all he was.

313
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,728
That's right, he did Get Lost.
That's my shit. That shit was tight.

314
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,938
There is no way
we are losing Linda Moon.

315
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,900
A, she's under contract,
and B, she's under contract.

316
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,485
So what's crackin'?

317
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,821
You want Joe Loop.

318
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,240
All I want is for Chili Palmer
to disappear.

319
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,744
You want Joe Loop.

320
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,755
Hey!

321
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,761
Yeah. Joe Loop.

322
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,138
Loop, Nick Carr
said I should call.

323
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,307
- Yeah, so?
- Got something for you to take care of.

324
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,686
- Or do I need to call somebody else?
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

325
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,731
I would love to.

326
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,121
- Here's your breakfast, sweetie.
- Pancakes again?

327
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,709
Pancakes... Yes, pancakes again.

328
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,253
Baby, would you tell this girl
when we were coming up,

329
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,089
all we had were sugar sandwiches.

330
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,883
Please. She does not know
how good she has it.

331
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,469
She does not know how good she has it.

332
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,471
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Mommy.

333
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,933
Bye, baby. Deshawn,
eat the pancakes, OK?

334
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,560
I put cinnamon on there, there's butter.

335
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,813
They're very good.
The strawberries are fresh.

336
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,816
Eat up. We got ten minutes.
I don't want you to be late.

337
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,659
- Top of the morning, Marge!
- Top of the morning, Sin.

338
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,793
Ain't this something...?

339
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,607
- 'Sup, dog.
- Must you play into the stereotype?

340
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,944
Turn that mess down.
This is the suburbs.

341
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,113
I'm on the damn Neighborhood Watch.

342
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,827
- Who did it?
- Not me.

343
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,663
Hm. That bitch owed me 300 grand.

344
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,874
I should have sent the coalition.

345
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:24,503
- Now shit's gonna have to get ugly.
- Ugly? Why are you trippin'?

346
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,215
- It ain't like you need it.
- Dabu, it's the principle.

347
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,385
Today it's 300 grand,
tomorrow it's three million.

348
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,180
- I gotta send a message.
- I feel you, dawg.

349
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,476
- You talk to the PD?
- The police?

350
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,103
- The police... The program director.
- Oh.

351
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,647
Check this out.

352
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,868
Well, hello, Mr. Program Director.

353
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,078
You see what happens
if you don't spin my records?

354
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,413
Hmm?

355
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,250
Good morning, guys!

356
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,298
- Hey, y'all speak to my daughter.
- Good morning, Deshawn!

357
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:14,053
Deshawn, sweetie,
why don't you go back inside, OK?

358
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:18,057
Daddy's having a little meeting.
I'll take you to school in my car.

359
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,520
- Bye, guys.
- Goodbye, Deshawn!

360
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,480
OK, boo-boo.

361
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,815
All right.

362
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,908
Play my records! You hear me?
Play, play, play my records.

363
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,619
Play Dub MD's!

364
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,455
Be still!

365
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,667
She gone?

366
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,380
I'm telling you, Edie, she's got
a voice, she's got the attitude.

367
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,299
- You're gonna love her.
- Sounds like you love her.

368
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:57,221
If you're asking me if I think she's
talented, yes.

369
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,973
I can't believe this.

370
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,018
Condolences on a two-way and half
of them are Tommy's ex-girlfriends.

371
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,649
Look, Chil, producing an album,
it's not like making a movie.

372
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:13,112
Good. Movies are too corporate.
I like to be spontaneous and creative.

373
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,407
I'm just saying, the music biz
is a bitch, you know?

374
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,117
It's dangerous.
It's rough out there.

375
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,326
Believe me, I know.

376
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,037
That's why I loved working
at MoMo's club, if you know what I mean.

377
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:27,376
- What'd you do at MoMo's? Book bands?
- Not really.

378
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,254
- Were you a bouncer?
- Not really.

379
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,176
You really were a shylock,
weren't you?

380
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,387
Did I tell you that she writes
her own music?

381
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,770
Oh. Here she is.

382
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,610
Here we go. Ready to show off?

383
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,614
Chili, look, I'm so sorry.
My damn replacement didn't show up...

384
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,658
It's all right. Calm down, calm down.
Edie, Linda.

385
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,037
- This is Edie Athens, Tommy's widow.
- Nice to meet you.

386
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,624
- I'm really sorry about being late.
- Don't worry about it.

387
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,084
So, Chili tells me
you've got a great voice.

388
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,294
Really?

389
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,714
- Well, you do.
- That is so sweet. Thank you.

390
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,133
- Is this where you play?
- Um...

391
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,844
I can't afford my own piano,
so they let me play here.

392
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,222
- Come on, let's go hear you. Yeah?
- Let's go.

393
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,649
I'm impressed. Did you write that song?

394
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,902
Uh, yeah. It's called I'm A Believer.

395
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,155
Just tell us you got nine more
just like it.

396
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,907
Forty more.

397
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:49,077
- But as long as I can do 'em my way.
- I like that.

398
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,121
- Let's get you in the studio.
- All right.

399
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,498
Good girl.

400
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,001
You weren't kidding, Chili.
The girl's got something. She's amazing.

401
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,419
Told you.

402
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,715
The only thing is, it costs a lot of
money to break someone, you know?

403
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,551
We gotta pay a mixer, a publicist...

404
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,680
- Hey, look. Steven Tyler's in town.
- Oh, yeah.

405
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,058
Aerosmith playing
at the Staples Center.

406
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,895
Tell me Dream On is not the greatest
rock 'n' roll song you ever heard.

407
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,897
You know what we oughta do?
We gotta call him.

408
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,524
- Call who?
- Steven.

409
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,817
Why?

410
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,318
So he could listen to Linda's music,

411
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,114
he could see for himself it's terrific
and help us launch her at his concert.

412
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,033
That's a great idea, Chil.

413
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:33,497
Hey, maybe Bono and Sting'll come down
and we could all cut a Christmas album.

414
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,958
- You know him, don't you?
- Know him?

415
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,545
It's Steven Tyler, I know his socks.
He's never gonna remember me.

416
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,756
Edie, you have a tattoo ofAerosmith
on your ass,

417
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,758
you can't get a meeting with him?

418
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,387
We want Steven Tyler,
we get Steven Tyler.

419
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,908
I would let the music do the
talking to tell me what lyrics to sing.

420
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,788
Even when I got caught up in not having
anything prewritten, which I never did,

421
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,790
I would scat to it.

422
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:25,340
It's just the music, the funk, the
sounds, the words, the rhyme, the shit.

423
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,093
You can't be creative
unless you step outside a little bit.

424
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,899
A little early, aren't you?
Open house is on Sunday.

425
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,944
- Yeah.
- It's Chili Palmer.

426
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,904
- Yo, Chil.
- How soon can you get here?

427
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,206
2:00am and there's traffic
on the 405. Oh!

428
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,543
- Who's your friend?
- I don't know.

429
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,921
I come home and he's bleeding
all over my one sheet.

430
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,631
Is this the guy that did Tommy Athens?

431
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,593
Nah. That guy had a black eye
and was wearing a rug.

432
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,972
This ain't no rug. This guy's got plugs.

433
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,058
I hate plugs. It looks like doll's hair.

434
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,687
Personally, I think grafting's the only
way to go. The look's more natural.

435
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,564
- 'Cause they use your own hair.
- Very interesting.

436
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,900
- Are you gonna help me with him?
- That why you called me here?

437
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,070
Yeah, you're a big guy,
I don't want to do it alone. Up...

438
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,491
Get his wallet out before the cops come.

439
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,118
All right, sit him down.

440
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,544
Here we go. Ivan Surva...

441
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,839
He's Russian. Been here for five months.

442
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,426
- The guy that killed Tommy, he saw you?
- Yeah.

443
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:37,222
You can ID him. He sees your picture,
sends doll-hair guy to take you out.

444
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,893
So, while he was waiting, he got
depressed and shot himself in the back?

445
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,061
Good point.

446
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,483
Who are all these people
tryin' to kill you?

447
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:53,947
I don't know, but I'm in the music
business now, it could be anybody.

448
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,911
Mugambo, my brother,
you check out the Chicks?

449
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,459
I told you, this Linda Moon,
she's a belter.

450
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,588
Mugambo, I gotta jump.

451
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,050
Love you, bro.

452
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,886
Get me Raji on the phone.

453
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,988
- What's up? It's Raj.
- Hey, Lowenthal.

454
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,784
Joe Loop was supposed to kill Chili
Palmer. Instead, he killed some Russian.

455
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,951
For real?

456
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,163
You two better work this shit out
or your ass is next.

457
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,457
You stupid ass.

458
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,511
I gotta tell you the truth.
I never seen a hit like this before.

459
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,263
I mean, you actually gotta get in line
to whack this guy.

460
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,227
How many men have you whacked, Joe?

461
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,437
Why? You wanna be next?

462
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,484
I'm asking you because
you hit the wrong guy.

463
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,156
They serve one hell of
a stuffed cabbage here, you know that?

464
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,200
The thing you want to remember is:
don't eat it too late.

465
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,161
- It tends to stay with you.
- I'll definitely keep that in mind.

466
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,376
- Where we at, Joe?
- We ain't nowhere.

467
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,878
I've now gotta go find the right guy.

468
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,050
The thing is...
it's gonna cost you another five grand.

469
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,885
What are you talking about?
I already paid!

470
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,554
You're the one
who did the wrong guy.

471
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,180
Whose fault is that?

472
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,100
It's your fault.

473
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,398
Tough shit. That's the cost of doing
business.

474
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,735
Look, you tell Nicky there's now
a new contract and I need five grand.

475
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,404
I can talk the deal with you.

476
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,739
It's my contract,
that's why I'm here with you.

477
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,868
You can't talk shit.
You're Nicky's girl.

478
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:07,789
Me and Nick are partners. We discuss all
facets of the business together,

479
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,084
be it music, be it underworld, girls...

480
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,377
Let me ask you a question.

481
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,131
Nice get-up...

482
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,757
How come he calls you his bitch?

483
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,634
- What?
- His bitch.

484
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,761
Why does he call you his bitch?

485
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,431
- What, mother...?
- Did I stutter?

486
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,769
What if I called you
a fat, stupid, guinea bitch?

487
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,771
Bitch!

488
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:44,075
I'd take this baseball bat that I got
out in the back of my Cadillac

489
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,453
and swat you across the mouth with it.

490
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,789
I said "what if" I called you that.

491
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,751
Hypothetically, just a scenario.
I wasn't actually saying it to you.

492
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,629
I'm always lookin' out.
I want to make sure I got the right guy.

493
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,797
I need the right
guy to get the right guy.

494
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,885
Now I want the five grand up front.
Tonight at the Mayan.

495
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,305
- Wait, the what?
- Take the wax out of your goddamn ears!

496
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,848
The Mayan downtown.

497
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,729
I never heard of the Mayan, so I was
making sure I knew where it was.

498
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,232
You mean there's something
you haven't heard of?

499
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,320
- OK, man.
- Take off.

500
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,156
Are we cool? Hmm?

501
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,116
Come on, man.

502
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,494
J. Leazy, what's up?

503
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,120
My man!

504
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,998
- All right, I feel that.
- Take off.

505
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,252
Mad respect for not giving respect.
I feel you.

506
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,546
Let me tell you something.
Don't do that J. Leazy shit.

507
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,549
- That's what your name...
- I don't like that. Don't do it.

508
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:48,556
I'll see you at the Mayan club, my man.
I respect you, Loop. Stoneface killa.

509
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,934
Next time try to find
something red to wear.

510
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,525
The future is now

511
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,654
It starts today...

512
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,951
- How about that?
- That girl's voice is off the chain.

513
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,371
But I gotta say, she needs a sound.

514
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,583
- What are you saying, she can't sing?
- No, that girl can totally sing.

515
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,460
But is she a star?

516
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,212
I don't know what you're talking about.

517
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,715
OK, take American Idol.

518
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:26,761
All those girls can sing, right?
But who cares? Who are they?

519
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,221
Then take, like, J-Lo.

520
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,391
That shit's been remixed so much,
I could be Jenny from the Block.

521
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,395
- Are you gonna produce this or not?
- Well, leave it to Tommy,

522
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,896
the last of the great spenders.

523
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,025
No wonder he kept the books locked up.
They're empty.

524
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,028
We don't own any of this stuff.
We're broke.

525
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,656
How can that be? You must have
made a pile off the Dub MD's alone.

526
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,908
- Weapons of Mass Destruction.
- I know who they are.

527
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,077
Well, whatever we made off them,
I can't find it in the books

528
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,581
which means we can't afford to record
her, which means no masters,

529
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,249
which means no CDs,

530
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,918
which sure as hell means
no more NTL Records.

531
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,255
Hello? So what'd you think?

532
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,758
I would love to produce your record,

533
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,094
and because I'm going to produce it,
it will rock.

534
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,514
- That's great.
- Capitol can miss you for a few days?

535
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,643
- I think we can negotiate that.
- Wait, you are with Capitol?

536
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,064
I was supposed to meet
an A&R guy over there, but, uh...

537
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,774
then I signed with Nick Carr.

538
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,032
Excuse me, Linda.

539
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,535
Uh, did you just say
you're under contract with Nick Carr?

540
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:37,707
Oh, no, not any more. Actually, Chili
told Raji that it was cancelled.

541
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,876
Oh.

542
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,045
Linda, why don't you
take a break, honey?

543
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,505
All right.

544
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,859
Chili, it doesn't work like that, OK?

545
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,780
You've gotta get the contract back from
him, otherwise he still runs the show.

546
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,783
Edie, I was a shylock.
I know how these things work.

547
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,536
I've known Nicky for years.
You'll get your contract.

548
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,997
Edie. Slight problem.

549
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,713
Ooh.

550
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,845
- This could be ugly.
- Why's that?

551
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,723
That's Sin LaSalle.
He manages and produces the Dub MD's.

552
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:40,270
- Tommy owe him money?
- Hmm. I would say... yes.

553
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,188
- Tiffany, man the phones.
- Huh? OK.

554
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,482
Hy, get in the office.
Look like you know what you're doing.

555
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,360
Edie, behind the desk.
You're still the boss.

556
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,863
These guys need to see
that NTL is still in business.

557
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,575
- OK, where shall I hide the books?
- Leave them on the desk.

558
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,994
And whatever you do,
don't mention the Russians.

559
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,665
Don't mention the Russians, OK.

560
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,507
No. Oh, no, we're totally
booked. That would have been good.

561
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,843
Oh, hang on one second.

562
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,805
Sin, hi. How are you?

563
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,309
Enough with the pleasantries.
Where's our money, Edie?

564
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,522
Sin.

565
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,192
Sin LaSalle. Man.

566
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,279
What's up? Come on.

567
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,075
No? OK, you know what?
I totally get it, man, I totally get it.

568
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,828
First, welcome to NTL.
Second, I want to introduce myself...

569
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,082
Hy Gordon. I know who you are.
Capitol Records.

570
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,920
Eight years ago
you turned down our demo... Hyman.

571
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,088
You know what?
You know Capitol, man.

572
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,257
It's like art by committee
over there, OK?

573
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,178
Personally, I totally dug
all y'all's sound.

574
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,723
All right? Seriously.
I'm thinking about leaving Capitol.

575
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:04,437
Look, Sin, you know,
Tommy left his will a mess.

576
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,939
If you give us a few weeks...

577
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,526
Then I call up and the phone is
disconnected.

578
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,530
Why don't you write a check for 300
grand and we'll kindly be on our way.

579
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,324
Sin, you know we don't have
that kind of money on hand.

580
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,578
- Then I need to check your books.
- Sin.

581
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,748
Be cool.

582
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,460
"Be cool?" You don't know me.

583
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,380
Oh, I know you a whole lot better
than you think I do.

584
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,551
Ivy League rich kid goes to Wharton,
gets an MBA,

585
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,594
puts on some Timberlands
and a throwback

586
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,513
and suddenly you got street cred?

587
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,773
Hey! Um, Sin, look,
I'll tell you the truth, OK?

588
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,235
- The Russians took it.
- The what?

589
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,820
The Russians.

590
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,782
With one of those insurance scams, like
"Give us a mil and we won't kill you."

591
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,661
And Sin, you knew Tommy, right?
He never wanted any trouble.

592
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,999
He gave them everything we have, but
these Russians, OK, these monsters...

593
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,834
They're animals!

594
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,421
They kept on coming back for more,
so Tommy told them to get lost.

595
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,172
Make a long story short...

596
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,302
..I'm a widow now.

597
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,189
Russians...

598
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,382
Excuse me, Chuckles.

599
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,266
He's my wife's cousin.

600
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,605
I really enjoyed that story, Edie.

601
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,150
I mean, Russians.
Russians.

602
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,736
- I know it's hard, but...
- I'm a highly educated man.

603
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:21,074
Sincerely, you don't expect me to
believe a story about some Russians?

604
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,827
Now, I suggest that you
open up those books

605
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,705
or things gonna get real ugly
up in here.

606
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,166
Sin, the books
are none of your business.

607
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,460
You'll get the money when NTL has it.

608
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,755
- Dabu.
- Thank you, thank you.

609
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,757
Popping me's not gonna do you any good.

610
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,551
But if you wait till Friday,
I'll get you your money plus the vig.

611
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,889
Plus the vig.
All right, all right, OK.

612
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,849
Everybody cool out.
Everybody calm down.

613
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:54,565
Dabu, calm down.
So you saying plus the vig?

614
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,860
- Plus the vig.
- All right. OK.

615
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,656
- All right, cool. We're gonna do this.
- Aw!

616
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,701
- Bu.
- I never get to shoot nobody. Never!

617
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:09,288
- You never let me do what I wanna do.
- You know, it's a long day, man.

618
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,207
You'll get a chance to kill somebody,
all right?

619
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,085
Calm down. We got some other
stops to make today.

620
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:19,257
All right, so...
I'm not gonna kill y'all today.

621
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,009
I'm gonna be generous.

622
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,138
But come Friday,
if you don't have my money,

623
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,474
the next meeting I arrange will be
between you and Tommy Athens.

624
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,518
if you get what I'm saying.

625
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:35,648
- I feel you.
- You feel me. You...

626
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,983
Edie.

627
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,406
Dabu.

628
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,992
Playa.

629
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,797
The vig! What's a vig?

630
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,508
Oh, my God! What are we gonna do?

631
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:06,095
You're gonna give them your fancy
equipment or have a garage sale.

632
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,847
We're not selling anything.

633
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,768
- Where are you going?
- Gotta see Nicky Carr. Hey...

634
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,520
Black Eyed Peas are playing tonight,
if you're interested.

635
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,367
You say there's a dark parking lot
by the Mayan, right?

636
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,705
Why are you tripping on me, Elliot?

637
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,082
You still crying over
that Chili Palmer shit?

638
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,960
No, he just... he said he was
gonna call me, that's all.

639
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,796
And did he call you back?

640
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,756
He's just messing with your head, man.

641
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,467
No Samoan faggot
going by the name Elliot Wilhelm

642
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,721
is gonna make it to the big screen,
raising a goddamn eyebrow.

643
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,057
I understand shit like this
'cause I ain't a homo.

644
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,685
Once you turn faggot, you lose all
self-respect. You're not wired right.

645
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,525
What the hell you stopping
the car here for? You crazy?

646
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,069
Hey! You move the car,
we can all get to work!

647
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,572
Why you stopping the car here?
What you doing? Get your ass back in...

648
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,826
- I'll kick your ass!
- What's up? What?

649
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:15,206
- You say it again and I quit.
- What? Oh, the faggot thing? Homo?

650
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:20,044
I'm walking. I ain't even tripping, man.
What'd I say? What'd I say?

651
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,672
Look, I know you frustrated
with all this bodyguard shit.

652
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,924
I smell you, man. I feel you pain.

653
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,552
This shit's temporary.
Stop crowding my shit!

654
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,220
When I signed you four years ago,

655
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:33,891
I said, "That man can sing. He's gonna
be a big star." A big star, man.

656
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,269
That's why I laid out all the paper
to put you up in a video.

657
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,771
I put paper down, man,
to put you in a video.

658
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,066
Right? No one else on this damn beach
has a video.

659
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,404
I love you like a brother. I used to bag
on you all the time, man, you tripping.

660
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,364
Why you doing that, man?

661
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,617
You wanna take a shot at me, do it.
Do it.

662
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,289
I'm just sayin', if that's what
this is gonna be, it's gonna be that,

663
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,624
but I'd prefer to stay
on the same page.

664
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,002
Man, let your voice be your ladder.
I'm serious.

665
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,337
This acting shit's
got you acting crazy, man.

666
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,299
What's up?
You know I love you, man.

667
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,970
Come on, man. E. Weazy!

668
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,307
Come on, baby. E. Weazy!
Come on, baby.

669
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,851
E. Weazy!

670
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,645
Come on, I'll clown it, baby.
You know I'll clown it.

671
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,314
Turn around, 'cause you know
I'll clown it.

672
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:25,943
Come on, player, stop hating.
Stop hating. Start participating.

673
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:30,156
Start participating, star. Come on.
Twinkle twinkle, baby. Twinkle twinkle.

674
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,249
Come on, Larry,
you sound like an A&R guy.

675
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,835
I'm banging the phones
like a goddamn wild man.

676
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,635
Larry, I'll call you back.

677
00:48:56,183 --> 00:49:00,019
I heard Sean Penn lives up here.
You see him much?

678
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,521
- Not as much as I'd like.
- Hmm.

679
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,735
- How did you get in here?
- Your maid left the back door open.

680
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:13,407
- I don't have a maid.
- I can tell.

681
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:16,285
Come on, get outta here
before I have to shoot you.

682
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,205
Aw, Nicky, sit down
and stop being such a hard-on.

683
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,464
So, Mr. Red Hot Chili Pepper...

684
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,466
I heard you were at The Viper Room.

685
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,885
Oh, so Raji told you about Linda Moon.

686
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,389
She's somethin' else, huh?
The heart and soul of that group.

687
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,725
I'm tellin' you, bro,
the Chicks are gonna be big.

688
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,062
How's that?
By singing songs from the '70s?

689
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,524
Don't laugh.
You're a movie guy, so you don't know,

690
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,818
but the music biz goes in cycles.

691
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,488
It's like Linda. When I signed her,
girl power was dead.

692
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,907
It was the year
of the singer/songwriter.

693
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:59,912
But now the market's flooded,
what do the labels want? Girl groups.

694
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,582
- Nicky, look at me.
- I am.

695
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,168
I want Linda's contract.

696
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,796
If you wanna produce
Linda's album, great.

697
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,173
I'm sure you could even get
a buck a record.

698
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,426
But I got her booked
into some major gigs, bro,

699
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,761
and I'm two seconds away
from getting her a deal.

700
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,932
You mean you've had Linda for two years
and never gotten her a record deal?

701
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,977
Chili, a trio is not born overnight.

702
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,938
I've had her for three days
and I already got her a label,

703
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,940
so it looks like we don't need you.

704
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:33,279
Let's get somethin' straight.
This isn't the movies.

705
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,283
You can't tell everyone you're
a wise guy and charm their pants off.

706
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,162
This is the music business.
We're all wise guys.

707
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,456
All right, wise guy,
I'll make you a deal.

708
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,794
Carosell, which is the dumbest name
I've ever heard for a company,

709
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:54,008
gives me Linda Moon's contract,
and if you ever threaten her in any way,

710
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,427
you'll regret it for as long
as you live, if that.

711
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,890
That's some deal. What's in it for me?

712
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:06,103
I'll make believe that that dead Russian
in my house had nothing to do with you.

713
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,524
You don't know what you're doin', Chil.

714
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,444
What makes you think
Linda can make it on her own?

715
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,155
She's got me.

716
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,882
- So are you a rapper now?
- Hey, Sniff Doggy Doo-Doo.

717
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,010
- You clowning my gear again?
- You like this shit.

718
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,098
Come on, Joe. You know my style
makes the ladies smile.

719
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,017
They just started Chattanooga
Choo-Choo, I love that song.

720
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,187
Damn, man. I wish I heard that.
I like a good choo-choo song.

721
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,690
- Do you want your money, my man?
- I ain't your man, asshole.

722
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,361
You remember my driver Elliot?
Elliot, give this man the envelope.

723
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,617
Ain't you gonna count it?

724
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,036
Nick ain't got the balls
to stiff me.

725
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,580
I like that idea you had
about having a bat in the car.

726
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,707
I had my man Elliot
go out and get one.

727
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,342
A red bat!

728
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:26,308
You don't send a queer to get a bat!
They like shiny, queer things.

729
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,813
It's not your fault. What you want is
a wood bat, like a Louisville Slugger.

730
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,023
Let me see. Hold this, please.
Thank you.

731
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,568
See? A bat like this
messes up a kid's swing.

732
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,404
You gotta take too long of
a swipe across the plate, see?

733
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,574
He never develops those fast hands
he's gonna need for the majors.

734
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,410
I don't know how fast it's gotta be
for my needs, know what I'm sayin'?

735
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,246
I ain't gonna be up no majors...
Like that one, huh?

736
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,084
Have a sandwich.

737
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,252
What's up?

738
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,008
- Raji, I think he's choking.
- You clowning me?

739
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,551
Joe, are you clowning with me?

740
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,021
You! Don't! Ever!

741
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,357
Disrespect! Me! One!

742
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,193
Raj, Raj, Raj.

743
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,783
Damn. He's dead.

744
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,493
Man.

745
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,293
Talk all that shit, man.

746
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,630
This right here,
this is the cost of doing...

747
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,256
..business!

748
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,721
All I want is appreciation, Elliot.

749
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,808
Chili Palmer don't realize
how hard I work for Linda Moon.

750
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,937
And what do I expect in return?
What do I expect in return?

751
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,482
My name on the damn CD so small
you can barely read the damn thing!

752
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,109
And where's that at?
Where's that always at?

753
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,528
On the back, at the bottom.

754
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,157
"Produced by Raji."
In tiny little letters, man!

755
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,495
I will not let him take that from me!
It's time I got some respect!

756
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,664
I will straight smoke Chili Palmer.

757
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,503
- Hey.
- Edie.

758
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,005
Hey.

759
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,591
I didn't take you
for a Black Eyed Peas fan.

760
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,345
Well, when they hooked up
with Sergio Mendes, they won me over.

761
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,515
Did you ever think about
becoming a singer?

762
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,225
- A singer? Me?
- Yeah.

763
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:35,688
Nah.

764
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,856
But I was a real live
Vegas showgirl once.

765
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,024
- Really?
- Yeah.

766
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,527
As soon as I was done washing clothes,
I got lucky.

767
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,530
One of those Tropicana revues, you know?

768
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:51,078
Chili, I worked so hard starting NTL,

769
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,747
and I'm a bit too old
to go back to Vegas.

770
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:58,043
I want you to stop worrying.
We're gonna meet Steven Tyler.

771
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,884
You know, I'd have liked
to have seen you dance.

772
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,469
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

773
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,116
- Well, you still can.
- Oh yeah? How's that?

774
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:33,746
- Do you dance, Chili?
- Edie, I'm from Brooklyn.

775
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:17,242
OK. So we walk in the Staples Center
with Linda's CD, and then what?

776
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,663
Eh... We put a gun to Steven's head
and say Linda's playing with Aerosmith.

777
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,211
You really like the music business,
don't you, Chil?

778
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,420
Love it.

779
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:35,219
Me too. Tommy and me,
we had a few records on the air,

780
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,429
but I'd just like one time

781
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:41,850
to turn on the radio and say,
"That's my song.

782
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,269
I produced that."

783
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,106
Something with soul, you know?

784
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,280
Your hair's different, huh?

785
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,534
Yeah.

786
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,995
I had it trimmed.

787
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,751
Night, Chili.

788
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,507
All right. Drive safe.

789
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,033
That's the pawn shop
my friend told me about.

790
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,870
It's surrounded by the Feds.
They're watching these Russians.

791
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,290
There he is.

792
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,085
- Oh, yeah.
- His name's Roman Bulkin.

793
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:56,174
What are you doing? You crazy?
They know what you look like.

794
00:59:56,342 --> 01:00:00,012
- What are you gonna tell 'em?
- No more than I have to, if that.

795
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,993
You've got a lot of balls.

796
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,081
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

797
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,459
There's half a dozen
undercover cops outside.

798
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,545
- Don't give 'em a reason to come in.
- Nyet!

799
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,050
Now, did you take this picture?

800
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,887
Go to hell, you greasy
wop son of a bitch.

801
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,681
Now you're the one
that's gonna need protection.

802
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,397
You go now.

803
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,611
Is that chest hair real?

804
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,371
Roman, look at me.

805
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,210
The next time you send someone
to kill me, make sure I'm home.

806
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,628
Have a nice day.

807
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,767
Yes!

808
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,773
Whoo!

809
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,738
Hm!

810
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,325
Like that?

811
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,125
Whoo!

812
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,505
Ow!

813
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,382
Scorching!

814
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,595
- Hey, Mr. Palmer.
- How're you doing, Marla?

815
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,305
- All right. You got a second?
- Sure.

816
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,641
So what are you doing here, Mr. Palmer?

817
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,394
Well, you know, when I was a kid
I went to a Jimi Hendrix concert.

818
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,480
This pawn shop has got
a '68 Stratocaster,

819
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:19,109
the same guitar he used to play.
The guy won't sell it to me.

820
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,485
This guy look familiar to you?

821
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,113
Maybe from back
in your Brooklyn days?

822
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:30,287
Oh, yeah. That's Joe Lupino.
Joe Loop. Is that his headshot?

823
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,664
In Griffith Park last night,
two dudes pulled in,

824
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,666
one of them's wearing
one of those pimp hats,

825
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,253
they pop the trunk, toss out a body
that's been worked over by a bat.

826
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,464
- It's Joe Loop.
- Baseball bat?

827
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,341
- Baseball bat.
- They pulled a Mama Cass on him, too.

828
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,386
The coroner found half a ham sandwich
stuffed down his throat.

829
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,181
You don't know what Joe was up to
would you?

830
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:53,018
No, but I wouldn't be surprised
if he was in the record business.

831
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:57,689
- It could have been a mob hit?
- Maybe. Except for the ham sandwich.

832
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,768
There he is, right there.

833
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,312
See the two seats next to him,
that's where we are, come on.

834
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,982
Chil, do you think
Steven's gonna remember me?

835
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,861
Aw, Edie, believe me,
you're hard to forget. Come on.

836
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,292
- Edie, over there.
- Got it.

837
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:27,404
- How'd you get these seats?
- I have a friend.

838
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,072
They're incredible.

839
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,951
Please, at the conclusion
of tonight's show,

840
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,704
listen for the Laker wrap-up show...

841
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,539
Edie?

842
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,627
- Steven?
- Oh, my God!

843
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:46,298
- Look at you. You look gorgeous.
- Oh, my God!

844
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:50,093
- You look incredible. How are you?
- I'm great.

845
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,638
Look at you. Look how those legs go up
and make an ass out of themselves.

846
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,266
You still got that Aerosmith tattoo
on your ass?

847
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,059
Where would it go?

848
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:02,772
- It's working.
- Why don't you park that right there?

849
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,952
Tell me something. What was
that stuff you put in our clothes?

850
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,788
- Do you mean the lavender water?
- Yeah, the lavender water.

851
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,209
I will never forget that smell.
Joe Perry's still talking about that.

852
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:26,963
Oh, my God. Steven, I want you
to meet my very good friend...

853
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,924
- It's an honor to meet you.
- ...Chili Palmer.

854
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,842
- The shylock.
- Yeah.

855
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,511
I saw you on Larry King.
It was you and...

856
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:34,930
Ariel Sharon.

857
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,723
- That was a hell of a show.
- Thanks, man.

858
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,391
Yeah.

859
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,606
Woo!

860
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,819
Listen to me, there's no problem.
No one's left the Chicks.

861
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:53,239
We're gonna play the gig, bro. Ciao.

862
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,369
- Linda's gonna play the gig?
- What do you think?

863
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:05,210
- Where the hell's Joe Loop?
- I haven't seen him since I paid him.

864
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,962
Gave him what he had coming.

865
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,509
Christ. I'm banging the phones
from dawn till dusk.

866
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:16,221
Bobby finally wants the Chicks to play,
but we don't have Linda.

867
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,975
- My man.
- My man.

868
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,979
You guys'll never guess who I saw today.

869
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,733
- Chili Palmer.
- Has anyone not seen him?

870
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:32,779
I'm at the Boot Barn on Sunset and I see
him talking to this cop in a Crown Vic.

871
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,741
- Remember the pawn shop by the bakery?
- Yeah, I know that place.

872
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,828
- Stolichnaya?
- It's thick with Russians.

873
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:45,834
One of 'em walks out,
points his fingers like a gun at Chili.

874
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:50,088
Jesus Christ.
The guy in Chili's house, the dead guy?

875
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,464
Mm-hm.

876
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,843
- I read in the paper he was Russian.
- So?

877
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,929
These Russians are probably the
ones that killed Tommy Athens.

878
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:01,057
And they know Chili can identify 'em.

879
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,852
Whoa! Whoa!

880
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,229
- Why are you trippin', man?
- Why am I trippin'?

881
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,316
I'm tripping, G,
'cause there is actually

882
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:14,946
Someone who wants Chi-li
Palmer dead more than me

883
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,699
I say we help him get what he wants.

884
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:19,951
Bam!

885
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,373
I'm a believer

886
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,126
The future is now

887
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:32,297
It starts today

888
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,716
Damn! She's good!

889
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,470
She sings, she writes her own stuff.
She's got it going on.

890
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,805
Not only does she write her own stuff,
she's got the voice,

891
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,640
the looks,
this girl's the whole package.

892
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:45,602
She wanted to put her in a movie,
you know, struggling singer...

893
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,978
That makes it big.

894
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,146
Exactly.

895
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,650
Hey look, she sounds cool.
Don't get me wrong.

896
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,905
But I gotta tell you guys. I'm not one
of those singers who shows up in movies.

897
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,365
I made it this far
without having to do it.

898
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,326
No, Steven, we don't want you
to be in a movie with her.

899
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,827
Then what's this all about?

900
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,835
I know that look, Chili.
I mean, what are you thinking?

901
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,048
I'm thinking of a song,
one of yours, Steven. Sweet Emotion.

902
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,591
Hmm.

903
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,636
Sweet Emotion,
I love that song.

904
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,764
I mean, it's a classic.

905
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,975
Do you mind my asking you, what were
you thinking when you wrote that?

906
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,894
What was I thinking about?

907
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,190
Man, at that point in my life, Chil,

908
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:35,151
we were neck-deep
in Toys in the Attic.

909
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,904
I mean, I had this high.

910
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,573
This buzz was goin' on, see.

911
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:44,202
This incredible emotion
like I never felt before.

912
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,539
Or maybe it was just the rock 'n' roll.

913
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,791
That is interesting.

914
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,376
Would you like to know what I think?

915
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:57,465
I don't think it was the rock 'n' roll.
I think it was your daughters.

916
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,176
My daughters? Mia, Liv?

917
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:03,096
Nah. They were babies back then.

918
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,266
That's right. And you were
a father for the first time,

919
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:09,435
feeling things
you had never felt before.

920
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,689
It's different than music and tours.
This was pure.

921
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,483
You wanted to be with them,
you wanted to protect them.

922
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,278
Nah, this high you were feeling,
that wasn't rock 'n' roll.

923
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,488
It wasn't?

924
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,992
It was the love you felt for your girls.

925
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,119
That sweet emotion.

926
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:37,088
It was. You're right.

927
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,090
I never thought about it like that.

928
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,926
You see, Steven, you and me,
we're not that different.

929
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:45,263
That's why you can understand
why we care about this girl Linda Moon.

930
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,266
I'll give it some thought.

931
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,268
Yes!

932
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,773
You know what else?

933
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,404
I can't believe
Linda's gonna play with Aerosmith.

934
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:05,950
We get Linda to do a duet with Steven
and we use his name to promote her CD.

935
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:09,037
Oh, my God, that's genius, Chil!

936
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,751
There's something I've been
wanting to do for a long time.

937
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,628
Oh yeah? What is that?

938
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,256
Don't move.

939
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,968
Did you put the TV on?

940
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:27,555
- No.
- I didn't think so. Stay here.

941
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,705
Elliot, what are you doing?

942
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,667
I've been waiting on your ass all night.

943
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,878
I got so bored, I made some tea,
I put in my video...

944
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,839
- You broke into my house?
- You told me you were gonna call.

945
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,675
I left you a message two days ago.

946
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,844
Elliot, I said I would get you
the audition and I will.

947
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,639
When? When? What the hell
are you waiting for?

948
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:13,184
If you don't mind my saying,
I don't like your attitude one bit.

949
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,525
Now, apologize.

950
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,368
- I'm sorry, Chili.
- All right.

951
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,995
It's just...

952
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:37,000
I bought a brand-new suit.
I bought new shiny red boots.

953
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,419
I got my new headshots done.

954
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,339
I ever prepared a monologue
from Bring It On.

955
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,467
Well, then, do it.

956
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,866
You guys have to go to Nationals!

957
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,745
What is this? Hush money?
We don't need you.

958
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:15,413
Why are you so mean?

959
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,249
I'm just trying to be strong
for my squad.

960
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,252
And I'm trying to make it right.

961
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,297
You wanna make it right?
Then when you go to Nationals...

962
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,258
..bring it.

963
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,429
I'll bring it. Don't worry.

964
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,186
I never do. Hm.

965
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,274
Scene.

966
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:48,363
Wow.

967
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,449
Is that the only monologue
that you got?

968
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,621
- Yeah.
- OK, well, that wasn't bad.

969
01:12:56,789 --> 01:13:01,417
But when you're doing a monologue, you
don't do both parts of the conversation.

970
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,045
You choose one continuous speech,

971
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,882
and you might think about doing a part
that's written for a man.

972
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,762
- Right.
- Now, you sing, right?

973
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,015
Yeah. Raji directed the video, though.

974
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:20,686
Well, I like it, but you might
think about singing a man's song.

975
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,110
OK.

976
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,821
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

977
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,948
All right. Now, go on,
give me that eyebrow thing.

978
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:43,835
- Look at that.
- I mean... That's somethin'.

979
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,002
Wow.

980
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:51,050
- Uh... When are you gonna call me?
- When your phone rings.

981
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,512
OK. All right. Uh...

982
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,599
You guys can keep the tape.
I got another one.

983
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,519
- Thank you. Thanks.
- See you, Elliot.

984
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,689
Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha!

985
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,191
Red aluminum.

986
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,773
I hear we could help each other.

987
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,445
I have ten seconds alone with Madonna.

988
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,697
I'm like, "I sat front row
atthe Blonde Ambition tour,

989
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,949
- not intimidated by your sexuality."
- Hey, what's up?

990
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,619
- Hey! We heard about Aerosmith.
- Yeah.

991
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,164
- Where the hell was I, you guys?
- Where's Linda?

992
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,917
I don't know. Linda hasn't shown up.
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

993
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:07,710
What do you mean
she hasn't shown up?

994
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,630
I'll call her.

995
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,591
- Hey, Linda.
- Do I sound like Linda, bitch?

996
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,092
- Who's that?
- Yo, Vanilla Ice,

997
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,886
just put her on the damn phone.

998
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,930
Miss Moon's about ready
to go on stage.

999
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:23,059
You wanna talk to her, you best wait
till after the show. Bitch!

1000
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,563
What are we gonna do?
They're making her perform.

1001
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,273
I'll handle this.

1002
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,314
This ain't no negotiation,
we're in a contract.

1003
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:11,440
You're making a mistake.

1004
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:13,818
Get your ass out there on stage.

1005
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,653
I ain't doing this.
You gonna perform or not?

1006
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,949
- How about not? Hi, honey.
- Hiya, Chil.

1007
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:23,160
We were talking to your friend Linda
here about the kind of cash

1008
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,663
she can make
if she stays with the Chicks.

1009
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:30,209
Well, I can see by the dressing room
it's a preview of good things to come.

1010
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:33,546
Hey, at least we can afford
to record her.

1011
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:36,048
Don't think I don't know
that NTL is broke.

1012
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:39,802
- Come on, honey. Let's go.
- You know what? This is bullshit.

1013
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:45,391
You wanna go, after all I did for you...
fine.

1014
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,101
But let me tell you something,
sweetheart.

1015
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,853
- You're a dime a dozen.
- That's right.

1016
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,814
We got gigs lined up,
recording sessions scheduled,

1017
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:55,693
there are dozens of girls
who are dying to take your place.

1018
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,738
Here. You want her so bad,
you're gonna need this.

1019
01:16:58,905 --> 01:16:59,905
What is this?

1020
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,243
It's where Linda's contract is.

1021
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:09,123
- Trying to set me up, Nicky?
- I don't go by that name anymore.

1022
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,750
Then why don't I call you Joe Loop?

1023
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,210
Seeing how he doesn't use his name
anymore either.

1024
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,837
What are you talking about?

1025
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,007
Nicky, look at me. Do you even know
where Joe Loop is?

1026
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:21,385
- How the hell do I know where he is?
- Why don't you ask Sisqo.

1027
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:27,391
We can handle this shit like gentlemen
or we can get into some gangsta shit.

1028
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,852
You shouldn't talk shit
about what you don't know.

1029
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,897
What? You mean that
you beat Joe Loop with a bat

1030
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,191
and dumped his body in Griffith Park?

1031
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,860
- Raji, what is he talking about?
- He's just talking.

1032
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,279
It's impossible that you're this stupid.

1033
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:43,074
That's probably his gun you got
stuck in your waist there.

1034
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,327
Look, all I know is Raji told me
to come here

1035
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,246
if I wanted my money
from the Viper Room gigs.

1036
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,249
- Now, are you gonna pay me?
- Am I gonna pay you?

1037
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,086
Are you gonna honor
your goddamn contract or not?

1038
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:57,880
Then you get paid.
This man can't do shit for you.

1039
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:01,258
Oh yeah? Then why is she playing
with Aerosmith this weekend?

1040
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,594
- What?
- Yeah.

1041
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,137
Oh, my God!

1042
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,431
We'll leave some tickets
for you at will-call.

1043
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,731
You hit the goddamn hit man.

1044
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:26,784
- The man was bad at his job, man.
- Yeah, just like you, stupid ass.

1045
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,835
- I'm so sorry, Chil, for real.
- Why's that?

1046
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:38,003
Because I didn't even wanna come here.

1047
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,966
Raji said he was gonna pay me the money
he owes me, and I'm broke.

1048
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,677
Look, at least we can get
my contract back.

1049
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:48,681
Believe me, there is no contract.
This whole pawn shop thing's a setup.

1050
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:53,310
It's Nicky Carr's way of getting
my head blown off. What's this?

1051
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,363
Well, now, imagine my surprise.

1052
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,991
We're out getting Mongolian barbecue

1053
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,035
and we come across
your little weak-ass ride.

1054
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:12,329
Did you leave any food in Mongolia?

1055
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,377
What do you get on those Hummers?
About 12 miles to the gallon?

1056
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,464
- Nine.
- Hmm.

1057
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:25,676
Dabu, thank you, Mr. Goodwrench.

1058
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:31,223
Now, I told you you had till Friday.
Your time is running out.

1059
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:35,227
I know how the days-of-the-week thing
works. You'll get your money.

1060
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:37,104
Consider this a courtesy call.

1061
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:41,400
Because come tomorrow,
my nine's gonna be a lot less courteous.

1062
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:44,820
Since you are being so courteous,
I'd like you to meet Linda Moon.

1063
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:45,946
Linda, this is Sin.

1064
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,908
- And Dabu.
- Dabu.

1065
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,828
Yeah... I know who you are. You, uh...

1066
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:55,873
You did the remix
on Samurai Soul's album, right?

1067
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,708
Linda Moon, you're the girl with...

1068
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,962
Dabu.

1069
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:07,885
Could you make your dining experience
a little less obtrusive?

1070
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,888
You're the girl with that big voice
I've been hearing so much about.

1071
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,226
If you ever decide
to get out the bargain basement,

1072
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,520
maybe I can remix a song for you.

1073
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,356
You're too pricey for us, Sin.

1074
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,608
Brother gotta get paid, right?

1075
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,695
Miss Moon.

1076
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,035
- Chop-chop.
- Yeah.

1077
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,538
- Dabu.
- Playa.

1078
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:49,969
- Damn.
- Will you stop playing with that thing?

1079
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,221
You ain't gonna figure out
your two-way, Elliot.

1080
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:55,599
Why don't you take a break and daydream
about things you like, like, you know,

1081
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,935
flying on a unicorn with
chocolate-covered cherries raining.

1082
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,814
I'm not the one who disrespected you,
Raji, Nick did.

1083
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:05,067
- Not me. Nick.
- Nick ain't even my boss.

1084
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:09,947
How's he gonna do me like that?
We're supposed to be partners. Damn.

1085
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,784
Raji, Nick left a message for you.

1086
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,621
If you go near Linda, he'll see that you
suffer excruciating pain

1087
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,624
and never walk again in your life.

1088
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,460
In other words, he'll break your legs.

1089
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,337
Why's he gotta say it
all poetic like that?

1090
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:28,007
Why can't he just say,
"I'm gonna break your legs?"

1091
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,342
A nice ass won't get you
through your whole life.

1092
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:32,720
When you turn 30,
you better have a personality.

1093
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:38,642
We don't need him anymore, Raj.

1094
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,020
I say it's time you took Nick out.

1095
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,900
What about Chili Palmer, genius?

1096
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,485
You can't even work your pager,
sitting there scheming.

1097
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:51,697
You'll get to Chili in good time.
Nick's the problem.

1098
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,991
If I take Nicky out,
all roads lead to me, Elliot.

1099
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,659
You don't think about shit, man.

1100
01:21:55,827 --> 01:22:00,664
Not if it ain't you who does it.
I'm talkin' about a setup, bro.

1101
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,010
- Hello.
- Sin LaSalle?

1102
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:17,097
- Who wants to know?
- Shut your punk-ass mouth!

1103
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:20,392
NTL owes you 300 large, right?

1104
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,480
Chili Palmer was gonna pay you,
but Nick Carr says,

1105
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:28,901
"Sin LaSalle? I wouldn't give my money
to that Alabama porch monkey."

1106
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:32,863
- Alabama porch... Nick Carr said that?
- You heard me, fool.

1107
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,199
He told Chili to give him
the 300 grand instead

1108
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:39,036
in exchange for some contract
or whatnot.

1109
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:42,539
Look man, you want your chips?
Do you want your chips?

1110
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:48,379
Then you best see Nick Carr. C-A-R'r.

1111
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,048
If I want my... Yeah, I want my chips.
Who is this?

1112
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:54,760
I'm the one schooling you, son.

1113
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,846
Ooh...

1114
01:22:58,014 --> 01:22:59,556
That is beautiful. You did it.

1115
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,934
Let's get some Roscoe's
up in this bitch.

1116
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:05,938
You want some chicken breasts,
some collards, some yams.

1117
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,232
Some waffles, man. Extra syrup.

1118
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,775
I love Roscoe's.

1119
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,152
I never told you this.
You know what I love about Roscoe's?

1120
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,825
I can take one drumstick, put it in my
mouth and suck all the meat off

1121
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,410
and then pull out that bone.

1122
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:22,579
Don't be puttin' your sucked-on
drumsticks with my chicken breasts.

1123
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:25,833
You better keep that shit...
I'm serious. Keep that shit separate.

1124
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,751
Only thing wet on that shit
better be the syrup.

1125
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:39,388
What's up? It's Raji.

1126
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,433
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.

1127
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,226
- How you doin'?
- Good.

1128
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,771
- Good. School was good?
- Yeah.

1129
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,481
You had a good day at school.

1130
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:52,901
You know what?
We're gonna skip ice cream today.

1131
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:55,654
Let's drop her off real quick. Yeah.

1132
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,203
Detective, my husband
was an amazing man.

1133
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:04,830
Please.

1134
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,291
But...

1135
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,088
he didn't leave NTL
in the best financial position.

1136
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:16,050
We spoke with his assistant Tiffany

1137
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:20,179
and she told us about an incident
involving an insurance salesman.

1138
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:21,638
Yes.

1139
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:28,020
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Fine.

1140
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,814
- Mrs. Athens...
- Please, call me Edie.

1141
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:33,942
Edie, um, we have reason to believe

1142
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,195
this gentleman was not
an insurance salesman.

1143
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,655
Really? I don't understand.

1144
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:43,994
Do you think it's possible that your
husband was involved with the...

1145
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,162
...the Russian Mafia?

1146
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:50,375
The Russian Mafia?
I mean, not that I know of, but...

1147
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,003
..I did find something.

1148
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:59,343
Maybe this will help.
I found it in Tommy's desk drawer.

1149
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:06,016
Nick Carr. It's a pawn ticket.

1150
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:08,268
Pawn ticket?

1151
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:10,604
Huh.

1152
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,689
I wanna pick this up.

1153
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:21,865
Get your black ass out of here.

1154
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,039
What do you tell a man
with two black eyes?

1155
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,585
Nothing. He's already been told twice.

1156
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:38,549
Are you gonna give me what I came for,
or are we gonna have a problem?

1157
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,093
Da.

1158
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:48,350
- An envelope?
- That's it.

1159
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,103
They bought it. You're up.

1160
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,868
How much can I get for this?

1161
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,919
And don't worry. Your hair looks fine.

1162
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,133
Damn!

1163
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,094
- I'm walking, man. I'm walking.
- Have you lost your...

1164
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:27,639
- Sit your ass down.
- Hang up the phone, Nick.

1165
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,893
Goodbye, Martin.

1166
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,940
- Sin. Good to see you, bro.
- Sit your ass down.

1167
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:39,693
- I can explain it to you.
- You best hope you didn't lie to us.

1168
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:43,614
If I can explain what happened, we could
get on the same page here, you know?

1169
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:46,366
Jesus Christ. What the hell's going on?

1170
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,785
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Shut your ass up.

1171
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:52,915
- Your man here says you got our money.
- I can explain it to you.

1172
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,960
- Raji said that?
- It's a misunderstanding.

1173
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:58,962
- Would you shut it up.
- Don't get excited.

1174
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,965
Let me tell you something,
NTL owes us 300 grand.

1175
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:04,009
Now, from my understanding,

1176
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:07,346
Chili Palmer took that money,
gave it to you for some contract.

1177
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,515
- Raji said that? He's full of shit.
- Watch what you say.

1178
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:14,353
'Cause we will drop his ass.
Take him outside.

1179
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,148
- Come on, man. Easy!
- Don't land on my Porsche.

1180
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,532
This ain't cool, man!
Come on, man. Pull me up, man!

1181
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:31,495
You can't hang me like this!
That's a long way, man!

1182
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,455
Come on, man! Pull me up, man!

1183
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,166
Come on! There's cameras
all over this bitch.

1184
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,710
You're gonna be
all over the surveillance!

1185
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,505
Please! Help! Help!

1186
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,590
Stop playing, man!
Stop bullshitting, man.

1187
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:47,469
That's a law office down there, man!
I'm gonna wake the lawyers up!

1188
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:52,599
Lawyers, can you see me?
It's Raji from Carosell.

1189
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:56,353
C-A-R-O...

1190
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,689
- I'm gonna drop your ass.
- Ah!

1191
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:00,065
You can't hit me, man.

1192
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:04,695
You can't hang me over a thing
and hit me! Pull my ass up!

1193
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:10,701
- Sin, my bro.
- Cut the "my brother" shit.

1194
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:13,537
- You're insulting my mother.
- I'm not in business with Chili Palmer.

1195
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,706
I'm trying to get him out.

1196
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:19,960
- That piece of shit stole my act.
- Son of a bitch.

1197
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,714
- You set me up.
- Who the hell are you?

1198
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,049
I give you ticket

1199
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:30,679
and you tell me Chili Palmer
come to my store and I kill him.

1200
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,557
But nyet, no Chili come.

1201
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:38,770
- Yo, Tolstoy, take a number.
- The cops come with ticket.

1202
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:41,398
- Cops? What cops?
- Excuse me, Vladimir.

1203
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:45,235
I don't know about the Ukraine,
but I was here first.

1204
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,362
Be cool, nigger.

1205
01:28:49,782 --> 01:28:51,408
Nigger?

1206
01:28:54,954 --> 01:28:58,915
Look, you don't understand.
This is how Chili Palmer operates.

1207
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,752
It's like a game between us.
He knows I tried to set him up,

1208
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,962
so he did it right back to me.

1209
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:07,841
Then game is over. No more setups.

1210
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,595
No more... nigger cops.

1211
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,347
Have you lost your mind?

1212
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:18,018
I mean, how is it that you can
disrespect a man's ethnicity

1213
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,438
when you know we've influenced
nearly every facet ofwhite America?

1214
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:24,483
From our music to our style of dress,

1215
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:29,112
not to mention your basic imitation
of our sense of cool.

1216
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,282
Walk, talk, dress, mannerisms.

1217
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,451
We enrich your very existence,

1218
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,621
all the while contributing
to the gross national product

1219
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,123
through our achievements
in corporate America.

1220
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,209
It's these conceits that comfort me

1221
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:46,671
when I'm faced with the ignorant,
cowardly, bitter and bigoted,

1222
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:49,841
who have no talent, no guts,

1223
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:53,470
people like you who desecrate
things they don't understand

1224
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:57,766
when the truth is you should say
"Thank you, man"

1225
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:59,726
and go on about your way.

1226
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:04,314
But apparently
you're incapable of doing that, so...

1227
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:08,944
Dabu.

1228
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:13,824
- My bad, dog.
- And don't tell me to be cool.

1229
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:15,659
I am cool!

1230
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:24,709
Racial epithets.
Why does it always come down to that?

1231
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:27,170
Makes me sad for my daughter.

1232
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,214
You need money? I got you.

1233
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:32,008
- Nick. Nick!
- I got you!

1234
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:35,554
Focus.

1235
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,684
Sin, I'm the one who promoted you.

1236
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,978
I'm the reason you're
even owed 300 grand.

1237
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:47,149
I'm telling you, you want Chili Palmer.

1238
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:51,319
- Pull my ass in!
- Bring his ass back inside.

1239
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:04,583
I want you to give it up and lay it down
for a good friend of mine, Linda Moon!

1240
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:39,070
- She's a diva.
- Told you, she's gonna be huge.

1241
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,461
Ain't that right, Joe Perry?

1242
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:26,701
- Linda Moon! Linda Moon!
- That's right! Thank you!

1243
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:38,463
Hey, you expect me to follow that?

1244
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,966
That was incredible.
I feel like I can't even breathe.

1245
01:34:42,134 --> 01:34:45,637
- 20,000 people will do that to you.
- Oh, my God.

1246
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:50,433
You were great. Good luck. The crowd's
only gonna get bigger for you.

1247
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,686
- Thank you.
- See you.

1248
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:56,439
- Linda Moon!
- Gonna be a big star.

1249
01:34:58,275 --> 01:35:01,111
- What about our girl?
- She was amazing.

1250
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:02,862
Amazing.

1251
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,991
- To Linda Moon.
- To Linda Moon. To you.

1252
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:13,957
You said something when Elliot was here,
that you wanted to do something.

1253
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,125
What was that?

1254
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:20,213
Hmm... Oh. Um...

1255
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,843
I think it might have been something...

1256
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,512
Something like this.

1257
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,729
Are you using me
to get into the music business?

1258
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:38,565
Oh, Edie. I like you.

1259
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:42,152
Good.

1260
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,770
Chil. Wake up.

1261
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:20,648
- What? What is it?
- Listen.

1262
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:21,858
What's wrong?

1263
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:25,528
I didn't leave the stereo on.

1264
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:30,325
Sounds like Knockin' on Heaven's Door.

1265
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,535
All right, I'll check it out,
I'll check it out.

1266
01:36:45,674 --> 01:36:50,261
Evening, gentlemen.
Interesting choice of music.

1267
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:57,393
"A cold black cloud's coming down."

1268
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,604
Gotta love Dylan, man.

1269
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:04,567
Biograph. It's a great album. We
wouldn't have this song without it.

1270
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:05,902
But we would have.

1271
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:11,241
Because Dylan wrote that for
that Peckinpah movie with James Coburn.

1272
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:13,743
You're in no position to correct me.

1273
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,252
It was for a soundtrack.
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.

1274
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:27,340
Yeah. Song they played when Slim
Pickens died in his wife's arms, right?

1275
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,592
This man knows his Westerns.

1276
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:33,388
Good movie.

1277
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:39,686
Gentlemen, thank you very much
for that VH1 moment in music history.

1278
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:44,816
Time's up. I want my money.

1279
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:48,403
All right, tomorrow you come by the
office and we'll deal with it.

1280
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,574
How bad d'you want this? Hmm?

1281
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:55,159
Know what that is?
It's Linda Moon's contract.

1282
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:58,955
- Nick Carr give you that?
- Much to his dismay.

1283
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:03,501
Now, that 300 grand you owe me,
I just doubled it,

1284
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:06,462
and you got one minute
to come up with my money.

1285
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:11,050
At the end of that time,
I wanna smell money or smell blood.

1286
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,677
It's your choice.

1287
01:38:14,346 --> 01:38:18,099
- Sin, I want you to hear something.
- I don't wanna hear shit.

1288
01:38:20,936 --> 01:38:21,978
You call that a minute?

1289
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,690
You don't even have to say nothin'.
I already know. I-I know.

1290
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:32,655
I can't help it, man.
Don't give me no gun, then.

1291
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:34,741
You know what I'm gonna do.

1292
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:39,495
Look, Sin, you're a music producer.
You gotta hear this.

1293
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:41,623
Shoot me later, but hear this now.

1294
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:47,670
[pop song playing, Linda singing[

1295
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,519
What the hell's going on here?

1296
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,857
Edie. I'm playing Sin the CD.

1297
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:11,235
Yeah. I noticed.

1298
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:15,865
Sorry to wake you, Edie,
but your girl here's got a good voice.

1299
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,243
I mean, the first song was nice,
but this one...

1300
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:22,080
Powerful lyrics just resonates with me.

1301
01:39:22,247 --> 01:39:25,792
You know what Sin said? He said
he just needs to put his touch on it.

1302
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,544
- That's it.
- That's exactly what I said.

1303
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:33,549
- So, how is Sin proposing to do this?
- Let me produce it.

1304
01:39:33,717 --> 01:39:36,177
I'll fatten up her sound,
give her some edge,

1305
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:38,179
maybe even add in a little...

1306
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:39,347
a little...

1307
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:46,104
- a little blues guitar, yeah, huh?
- Man's got a point, Edie.

1308
01:39:46,271 --> 01:39:49,232
Nothing against Hy Gordon,
but the man is white.

1309
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:54,445
That's true, Sin.
But... what's that gonna cost me?

1310
01:39:55,614 --> 01:39:59,409
Just a producer's credit...
and a little something on the back end.

1311
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:03,913
- Which could end up being millions.
- Only if I make it a hit.

1312
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:09,877
Dabu. Tea!

1313
01:40:10,045 --> 01:40:12,171
What's with the finger? What's that?

1314
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:15,091
That's not gangsta. That's not gangsta.

1315
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:16,634
Got you.

1316
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:27,895
- What do you want, Raj?
- Sin LaSalle produced her single.

1317
01:40:28,063 --> 01:40:30,481
- So?
- That bitch hung me out a window!

1318
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,900
Now he gets to be her producer?
I ain't havin' it.

1319
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:36,821
At least he's not hanging out
in strip clubs in the middle of the day.

1320
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:41,034
Listen to me. Chili called, he said
Linda played with Aerosmith and killed.

1321
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:44,454
Tried to offer me a back-end bullshit
deal to promote her.

1322
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:48,875
- Can you believe the balls on this guy?
- So he's gonna make her a big star?

1323
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,252
Not if he's dead.

1324
01:40:52,963 --> 01:40:54,422
Are you saying we can smoke him?

1325
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,799
I'm saying you and Elliot
take care of him

1326
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,968
and I'll forget you tried
to take me out.

1327
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:16,694
Elliot!

1328
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:20,656
Elliot, you home?

1329
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:31,918
Elliot?

1330
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:41,052
Elliot, Chili Palmer.

1331
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,554
I got you an audition
on a Nicole Kidman picture.

1332
01:41:43,722 --> 01:41:46,849
It's next Tuesday at 3:00.
Give me a call.

1333
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,648
No, he ain't. Delete that shit.

1334
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:28,558
I love that blues guitar. It's nice.

1335
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:35,231
It's lyrical but tough now.
I can almost see the video.

1336
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:39,026
- We should get Shotgun to do the video.
- Now, he tight.

1337
01:42:39,194 --> 01:42:40,153
We'll never get him.

1338
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,489
The man's the Scorsese of music videos.
It won't happen.

1339
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:47,118
The man was my production assistant
on Get Leo. I'll get him.

1340
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:50,746
Linda, beautiful,
but when you do the hip thing,

1341
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:54,750
I need more hip, like a sexier hip,

1342
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:57,128
like a bigger, sexier hip.

1343
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:59,046
You'll do it. I'll be back.

1344
01:42:59,214 --> 01:43:01,799
OK? Right on "action".

1345
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:17,815
It's late. Shouldn't you
and Baby Huey be sleeping?

1346
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:19,233
That's it?

1347
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:22,570
No, "Hey, Nick. Good to see
you, man. Did you lose weight?"

1348
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:27,533
She's good, bro.
You get Miss Bangkok in there,

1349
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:28,743
you got something.

1350
01:43:28,911 --> 01:43:33,206
- You always had an eye for talent.
- It's time you, me and Edie had a talk.

1351
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:36,792
You wanna talk business, talk to me.
Leave Edie out of this.

1352
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,880
I'm already in negotiations with Edie.
I'm just coming to get you.

1353
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:43,549
Is that right?

1354
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,988
Edie.

1355
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:11,452
Well, if it isn't Flea Diddy.

1356
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:15,748
It's P. Diddy. Don't be coming up in
here like you know anything about rap.

1357
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,959
Oh, I bet I know more than you do.

1358
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:20,419
You probably don't even know
who the Sugar Hill Gang is.

1359
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:23,005
But I know who the Bust A Cap
In Your Ass Gang is.

1360
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:28,803
Let me tell you something, Chil.

1361
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,555
When I told you I wanted us to work
together, I was being genuine.

1362
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:33,349
Oh, I could tell.

1363
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:35,309
But now that Linda's
making a name for herself,

1364
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:38,354
she's gonna need a real professional
managing her career.

1365
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:40,648
So I'm gonna need that contract back.

1366
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:52,660
You know, just take it. It's yours.

1367
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:57,790
Takes a big man to realize
a bigger man swings a bigger dick.

1368
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,918
Nobody's a bigger dick than you, Nick.

1369
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:04,922
So what the hell's this?

1370
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:09,302
- That's Linda's contract.
- We thought you'd appreciate the irony.

1371
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:14,557
- You know how turnabout's fair game.
- Fair game. I like that.

1372
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,226
That could be the name
of my next girl group.

1373
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:19,312
Take care, Chil.

1374
01:45:24,609 --> 01:45:26,652
- You disrespected me.
- Move your ass.

1375
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:29,864
It's a damn shame, Chili.

1376
01:45:30,032 --> 01:45:33,409
'Cause now you're gonna have to go
commit suicide in a dark alley.

1377
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:37,038
There goes your audition.

1378
01:45:39,249 --> 01:45:41,959
- What audition?
- I left you a message.

1379
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:44,962
- Stop bullshitting, man.
- At home and on your two-way.

1380
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:47,506
You didn't leave me a message.
I checked, nobody called me.

1381
01:45:47,674 --> 01:45:51,802
- Maybe somebody erased your messages.
- Check your two-way. Go ahead.

1382
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:53,262
Stop this shit.

1383
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:55,181
We got business to take care of.

1384
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,768
- Hey.
- You need help?

1385
01:45:58,935 --> 01:46:01,771
- All right.
- There you go.

1386
01:46:01,938 --> 01:46:04,190
- Is that it? Just hit that...?
- Mm-hm.

1387
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,451
- How could you do that, Raj?
- What are you talking about?

1388
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:16,744
Why am I standing here?

1389
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,790
You've been erasing my messages?
I have an audition on Tuesday.

1390
01:46:20,957 --> 01:46:23,167
What? There ain't no damn message
on that thing.

1391
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:26,837
- How could you do that, man?
- Why you tripping on me like that?

1392
01:46:27,005 --> 01:46:28,923
- E. Weazy!
- Elliot, be cool.

1393
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,842
Cap-easy! In your ass! How could you?

1394
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:34,804
- Put the gun back where it belongs.
- You never want me in movies.

1395
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:37,348
- Come on, Sugar Tank.
- After all these years? Sugar Tank?

1396
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:41,143
Come on, man. Check in.
Check in. I'm your ace, man.

1397
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:51,487
What? They got me!
Damn! They got me, Elliot!

1398
01:46:57,869 --> 01:46:59,495
They got me, man!

1399
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,500
- Tuesday, right, Chili?
- That's right.

1400
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:30,276
Sorry about your comrade, comrade.

1401
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,037
- What the hell is this?
- Don't know.

1402
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:49,712
- What the hell...?
- Nick Carr!

1403
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:54,383
You're under arrest
for the murder of Joe Loop.

1404
01:47:57,262 --> 01:48:01,682
And now, the final nominee
for MTV's Best Video of the Year:

1405
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:05,561
Linda Moon with the performance
ofhersmash hit, Ain't No Reason.

1406
01:50:06,224 --> 01:50:09,268
Tonight you've heard
the five nominated songs. Dabu.

1407
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:12,688
Yeah, I'm Dabu the Great.
We got the Dub MD's in the house.

1408
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,064
Yeah!

1409
01:50:14,232 --> 01:50:17,610
The Best Music Video Award goes to...

1410
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,614
Tell 'em, Dabu!

1411
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,449
First Believer, and now this.

1412
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:27,202
Yeah, Ain't No Reason To.
Linda Moon's fourth award of the night!

1413
01:50:31,374 --> 01:50:32,416
Sin!

1414
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:47,097
Oh. Wow.

1415
01:50:47,265 --> 01:50:49,808
This is amazing.

1416
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:53,771
First I would like to thank
my producer, Edie Athens.

1417
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:59,652
I'd also like to thank Hy Gordon
and Sin LaSalle.  Thank you.

1418
01:51:00,528 --> 01:51:03,238
And last but not least,
I would like to thank the guy

1419
01:51:03,406 --> 01:51:06,367
who has believed in me
from the very beginning.

1420
01:51:06,534 --> 01:51:09,953
He made all of this happen.
Chili Palmer, thank you.

1421
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:12,081
Thanks.
