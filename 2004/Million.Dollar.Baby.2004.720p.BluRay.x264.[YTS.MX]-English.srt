1
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,042
Do it!

2
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,644
Get him! Get him!

3
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:50,363
You got him!

4
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,360
I only ever met one man
I wouldn't want to fight.

5
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:08,846
I can't stop that.

6
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:10,520
Get outta here, you useless tit.

7
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,759
When I met him, he was already
the best cut man in the business.

8
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:14,882
Can you stop it?

9
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:18,357
Started training and managing in
the '60s, but he never lost his gift.

10
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:19,562
No.

11
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,879
Let me have a look at him.

12
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:31,125
He's fine. He's fine.

13
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:34,962
He ain't if you don't stop this
bleeding. I'll give you one more round.

14
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:37,562
Seconds up. Let's go.

15
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,843
What do we do?
Tell me what to do.

16
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:41,960
You let him hit you.

17
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,927
Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.

18
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:50,362
Cut's too wide,
too close to the bone...

19
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,837
maybe you got a severed vein...

20
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,567
or you just can't get
the coagulant deep enough.

21
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,606
There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...

22
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,076
down in the different
layers of meat...

23
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:06,078
and Frankie knew
how to work every one.

24
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:33,841
People love violence.

25
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,000
They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.

26
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,317
Same people claim to love boxing.

27
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,762
They got no idea what it is.

28
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:44,283
Boxing is about respect.

29
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,199
Getting it for yourself...

30
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:49,360
and taking it away
from the other guy.

31
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,045
I'll warm up the car.

32
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:56,435
Mr. Dunn?

33
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,480
I owe you money?

34
00:02:58,647 --> 00:02:59,602
No, sir.

35
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,359
I know your mama?

36
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:03,404
I don't rightly know, sir.

37
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,636
Then what is it you want?

38
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:08,641
I was on the undercard. I won
my fight, too. Maggie Fitzgerald?

39
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,321
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

40
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,643
- Did you happen to see it?
- Nope.

41
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,160
I did pretty good.

42
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:17,761
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

43
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,565
I don't train girls.

44
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:23,037
Maybe you should. People see me
fight, say I'm pretty tough.

45
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:26,645
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

46
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,960
It's a mistake.

47
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,479
Car should be able
to back up, Frankie.

48
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:50,838
Just push, will ya?

49
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:54,679
- What did Hogan want?
- Offered us a title shot.

50
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,641
About time.

51
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:57,876
I turned him down flat.

52
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:01,242
Two or three more fights,
you'll be ready.

53
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,204
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

54
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,757
Willie, you get
one shot at the title.

55
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,838
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

56
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,916
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

57
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,164
Whatever you say, Frankie.

58
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:25,197
Frankie liked to say
that boxing is an unnatural act...

59
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,200
that everything in boxing
is backwards.

60
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:31,400
Sometimes...

61
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,806
best way to deliver a punch
is step back.

62
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,996
Well, do Your best, Lord...

63
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,279
protect Katy.

64
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,520
Annie, too.

65
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,320
Other than that...

66
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,157
You know what I want, there's
no use me repeating myself.

67
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,436
But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.

68
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,755
Bye.

69
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,604
Father, that was
a great sermon, made me weep.

70
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,405
What's confusing you this week?

71
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,717
Same old one.
God, three God thing.

72
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,038
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

73
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,206
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle,
and Pop all rolled up in one big box?

74
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,676
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

75
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:43,524
You come to mass every day to wind
me up. It won't happen this morning.

76
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:44,642
I'm confused.

77
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,445
- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.

78
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:49,360
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

79
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,801
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

80
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,686
- What about the Holy Ghost?
- He's an expression of God's love.

81
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:56,441
- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid!

82
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,723
What is he, then?
Does that make him a demigod?

83
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:01,321
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

84
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,363
- Did you write your daughter?
- Absolutely.

85
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,085
Now you're lying to a priest.

86
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:14,478
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to mass tomorrow.

87
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:28,246
Some people'd say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.

88
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:32,523
Frankie'd say, "Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart...

89
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:35,247
and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating."

90
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,677
I think I only ever met
one fighter who was all heart.

91
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,398
My name's Dangerous Dillard Fightin'
Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

92
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,842
out of Broward County, Texas!

93
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,327
Danger showed up
couple of years back.

94
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:03,795
He'd come visiting L.A. With
Ervel, his mama's new boyfriend.

95
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:09,086
Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.

96
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:14,286
Danger looked for him for about
a week before he introduced himself.

97
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:20,284
You know, I gots nothin'
against niggers.

98
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,086
That's nice to hear.

99
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:28,679
Lotsa people
where I comes from does...

100
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:32,203
but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

101
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,925
niggers or not.

102
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,760
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

103
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,316
Just one of those questions you ask,

104
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,876
but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.

105
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:45,319
I'd likes to become the Welterweight
Champion of the world.

106
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:50,040
And I challenge
the Motor City Cobra...

107
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,118
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

108
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:56,166
to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!

109
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:58,921
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

110
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,762
You gotta have at least
one fight to be ranked.

111
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:04,361
I'll fight any man, anytime!

112
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,562
You a bad man, huh?

113
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:08,241
Get in the ring.
Go a round with me.

114
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:09,762
Shawrelle...

115
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,076
I will.

116
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:12,522
Leave him alone.

117
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,805
Danger, go on back to training.

118
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,599
Will do, Mist' Scrap!

119
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,002
Them some nice tights, Danger.

120
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,002
I'll give you that
ass-whuppin' later, Olive Oyl.

121
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,476
Those pants
look real pretty on you, bro.

122
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,205
Give his mama back her tights.

123
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,882
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...

124
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,285
but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.

125
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:43,201
Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.

126
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,598
Bobby wanted to move to Florida
and Frankie wanted some security.

127
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:49,356
Bobby died
while he was packing.

128
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:53,445
Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.

129
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,599
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

130
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,439
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

131
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,445
Well, he's hurting me.

132
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,077
Breaking my heart watching him punch
the air like it's gonna punch back.

133
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,005
And how many times have I gotta
tell you that bleach is bleach?

134
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,762
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff? You
don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

135
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,599
It smells better, Frankie.

136
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,037
Bleach smells like bleach!

137
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,521
- Hey, Scrap.
- Hey, Mr. Willie!

138
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,645
Nice fight last night.

139
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,678
- Big Willie!
- Hey, Sally.

140
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,805
Nice fight.
People are talking.

141
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,642
What the hell kind
of language is that?

142
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,561
What do you want?

143
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,880
I thought you might like to know

144
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,925
you got a fighter not talking
to another manager.

145
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,597
Not talking to another manager?

146
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,086
And not just any manager...

147
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:21,675
Mickey Mack.

148
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:27,166
You came in here to tell me that Big
Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

149
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,117
Not a word.
Neither one of them.

150
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,164
I'm trying to read here.

151
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,557
Well, if you think
that's more important.

152
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,200
Who's your new girl?

153
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:41,602
What?!

154
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,165
Jesus Christ.

155
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:58,326
Better hurry up. If she keeps hitting it
like that, she gonna break her wrists.

156
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,245
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

157
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,840
Thought you might change your mind.

158
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:15,121
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

159
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,482
Don't need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

160
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:21,196
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your
boss, and don't you be calling me that.

161
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,801
- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.

162
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:26,803
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

163
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,636
No.

164
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,004
Then I might as well
keep calling you it.

165
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:35,207
She came from
southwestern Missouri...

166
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:39,246
the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia, set

167
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:43,646
in the cedars and oak trees somewhere
between nowhere and good-bye.

168
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,716
She grew up knowing one thing:

169
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:48,525
She was trash.

170
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,955
It's for my dog.

171
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,402
She'd come 1800 miles,

172
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,762
but Theodosia was still
just over the hill.

173
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:27,401
Working the bag, boss.

174
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:30,877
Not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

175
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,724
Give her her money back.

176
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,076
You sure?

177
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,845
- How much did she pay?
- Six months.

178
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,882
- Jesus Christ.
- No, I'll give it back.

179
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,356
No, don't be
a smart-ass now, will ya?

180
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,483
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

181
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:04,083
just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

182
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,044
But just don't encourage her,
understand?

183
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:10,326
And what's Danger doing
out there? What's he looking at?

184
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:16,320
Looks like a bottle of water.

185
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:18,720
He paid his dues?

186
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:23,201
Dues? Boy can't afford pants,
want him to pay dues?

187
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:25,683
Get out of my office.

188
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,676
Fuck me.

189
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,639
Can't think of it as a bag.

190
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm not a trainer, but I can
show you this, if you'd like.

191
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,157
Appreciate any help I can get.

192
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,366
You want to think of it as a man,
see? He's constantly moving.

193
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:42,156
He's moving towards you,
around you, away from you.

194
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:43,237
All right?

195
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:47,366
Don't hit him when he's coming towards
you because he'll just push you back...

196
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,525
he'll smother your punches,
take your balance, right?

197
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:54,883
So, you watch him real carefully. Keep
rotating and keep your head moving...

198
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:59,006
and keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

199
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:03,326
Go ahead, now. Good. Keep
rotating, keep moving. That's it.

200
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,885
Good, good.
Keep that chin tucked in.

201
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,365
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

202
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,722
- Good, good, good.
- Like that?

203
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,764
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

204
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,802
Tuck that chin in now.

205
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,078
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.

206
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:25,876
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

207
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,644
You do have a speed bag.

208
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,596
I'll just borrow it
till I can buy my own.

209
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,439
All right.
You go on home now.

210
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,246
- I'll walk out with you?
- I am home.

211
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,398
- Want to see?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:00,486
It's nice.

213
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,322
Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

214
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:09,444
Nah, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

215
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,195
Thank you.

216
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,563
If there's magic in boxing...

217
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:34,636
it's the magic of fighting
battles beyond endurance...

218
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,604
beyond cracked ribs,

219
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,361
ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.

220
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,758
It's the magic
of risking everything

221
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,521
for a dream
that nobody sees but you.

222
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,242
Okay. Watch the footwork!

223
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,082
That's it.

224
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,756
Hey, Flip.

225
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,637
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

226
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,604
I think
I found somebody you can beat.

227
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,562
I don't fights women.

228
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,881
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro.
You know why?

229
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:43,686
'Cause she, nah, you,
you could fight to him...

230
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,917
and then you could kiss to him.

231
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,202
Then fight one more time.

232
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,927
That's beautiful, man,
that's like poetry!

233
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:51,122
It's like poetry.

234
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,039
You been reading and shit.

235
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,162
That's a girl, man?

236
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,520
I think you right. Look at her little
titties. They're like mosquito bites.

237
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,042
Man, that's barely
even a mouthful.

238
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,845
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

239
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,919
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

240
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,039
Canvas has titties!

241
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,276
Look at me! I'm Shawrelle!

242
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,005
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

243
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:32,000
Come on, bro, the floor having
titties, that's funny, bro.

244
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,520
Shut up, man.

245
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,518
What you laughing at?

246
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:38,076
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

247
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:45,158
Yo, when they start making
those tights for men, Flippy?

248
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:46,282
Punk.

249
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:50,640
All right, that's enough
for the day.

250
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:54,966
I'll give you a rubdown.

251
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:59,006
I can't. My middle one's got a piano
lesson. I told Grace I'd drive her.

252
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:02,324
- Something wrong with Gracie's car?
- She hates that car.

253
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,604
Wants the old one back, but
the dealer already got a buyer.

254
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,439
Maybe I should talk
to the dealer.

255
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:09,965
I'd appreciate that.

256
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,082
Okay.

257
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,202
Thanks.

258
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:13,842
See you later.

259
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:25,159
The man's a rubdown whore
and today he doesn't want one?

260
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,005
You ever do any work
around here?

261
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,327
Not my job I'd worry about,
if I was you.

262
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,445
Little girl seems
to be coming along.

263
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:41,481
Yeah. It's almost like
somebody's been helping her.

264
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:46,161
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

265
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,799
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got!

266
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,885
I wonder how the hell she got that.

267
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,446
I wonder.

268
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:07,123
I'm gonna need
that speed bag back.

269
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,755
- This bag?
- Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

270
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,077
If you're hitting it, people
will think I'm training you.

271
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,283
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

272
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,406
Yes, it is. Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

273
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,798
I gotta agree,
I am embarrassing myself.

274
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,564
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know?

275
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,955
I understand.

276
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,798
Look, you seem
like a nice girl.

277
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,800
- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.

278
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:42,366
You'll find a trainer here or elsewhere
that will want to train a girl.

279
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,202
It's the latest
freak show out there.

280
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:48,882
The only trouble is they'll be wasting
your time because you're too old.

281
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:51,966
I don't feel that old.

282
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,563
Neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

283
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:59,165
Takes about four years
to train a fighter.

284
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,242
How old are you?

285
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,959
31 until my next birthday.

286
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,765
There you go. 31.

287
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,886
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

288
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,438
Already been working it
for three years.

289
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:16,156
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

290
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,085
I've never had any, boss.

291
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,356
I hate to say it, but it shows.

292
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,563
Somebody's gotta
be honest with you.

293
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,600
I hate to be the one
to tell you the truth.

294
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,722
Yeah.

295
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:32,201
Sorry for using
your bag, Mr. Dunn.

296
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:36,680
You're not
gonna cry now, are you?

297
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,326
No, sir.

298
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:43,235
Here.

299
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,240
- Keep the goddamn thing.
- No, you need it.

300
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,920
No, take the bag.

301
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,479
I haven't seen it
in 20 years anyway.

302
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:56,166
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

303
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,842
I'll just borrow it
till I buy my own.

304
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,445
Just don't lose it.

305
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:14,046
Yeah, I know, Hogan, your guy's
the champ, so we don't split fifties...

306
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,801
but if I don't see
forty percent...

307
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:21,595
Call me back when it's sixty-forty
or don't call me back at all.

308
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:31,802
Hey, Willie?

309
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,082
Hey, Frankie.

310
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:34,760
Is something wrong?

311
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:38,442
Sorry to come to your house like this, I
know you don't like people dropping in.

312
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,077
You're not people, Willie,
you're welcome anytime.

313
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,802
Thank you for getting
Grace's car back.

314
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,438
You don't have to thank me.

315
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:50,917
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

316
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:52,805
Gracie broke out and cried
when she saw it.

317
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,082
Really?

318
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,557
I also needed to talk
with you about business.

319
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:01,606
I just got off the phone with Hogan.
We're all set for September.

320
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,564
Everything but the split.

321
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,486
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

322
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,836
What?

323
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:15,279
Willie, the title is just
two fights away.

324
00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:19,406
It ain't that. It's like
you said, I got one shot.

325
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,485
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

326
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:26,364
I need somebody in the action,
who can make things happen.

327
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:29,720
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

328
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,401
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

329
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:37,078
So, I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

330
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:38,521
Only way he'd do it!

331
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:43,002
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you've been waiting on a title.

332
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,725
I wish it could've been with me.

333
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:50,286
Mickey Mack's a business man.
He can't teach you nothing.

334
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,077
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

335
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:04,086
There's some things that people
just don't want to hear.

336
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:17,206
And I challenge
the Motor City Cobra

337
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,164
Thomas Hit Man Hearns...

338
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:23,286
to fight me for the Welterweight
Championship of the whole world!

339
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,241
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

340
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,847
Just working
on my footwork, Mist' Scrap.

341
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:34,243
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

342
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:42,278
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

343
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:47,481
I'm thinking how I'm gonna
hit it hard for you, Mist' Scrap!

344
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:54,716
No one had the heart
to tell Danger

345
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,396
that Hearn had retired years ago.

346
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,119
I heard about Willie.

347
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:10,042
That's cold, man,
that's dead cold.

348
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:13,519
Course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

349
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,402
At least I can see
through both eyes.

350
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,916
Didn't do you a lot
of good though, did it?

351
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,165
Well, I've got the gym.

352
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:24,921
Don't need to be training
fighters at my age.

353
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:28,080
Willie tell you why?

354
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:31,045
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

355
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:34,358
Nah, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

356
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:37,166
I found him, I stuck with him
for eight years.

357
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,158
How's that
for not believing in him?

358
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:42,603
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

359
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,837
I'm amazed
he stayed around this long.

360
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:48,044
Getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

361
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:52,246
What was I supposed to do? Just put
him in over his head, not protect him?

362
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:54,961
You were protecting him
from the championship.

363
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:56,003
Yeah.

364
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,476
Well, now it makes sense.

365
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:01,844
What about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

366
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,362
You were a hell of a fighter,
a lot better than Willie.

367
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:05,676
He get you a title fight...

368
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:09,556
or did he bust you out banging your
head against other people's fists...

369
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,080
until you lost your eye?

370
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:13,166
I had my shot.

371
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:16,006
I went out swinging
and no man can say I didn't.

372
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,322
I remember.

373
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:21,082
Excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

374
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,556
cleaning up other people's spit.

375
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:28,523
Yeah, you're right. You're the smart
one. You're the one learning Greek.

376
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,636
It's Gaelic.

377
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:33,844
You just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

378
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:36,043
How do you say that in Gaelic?

379
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,116
Thanks.

380
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:55,686
The action continues as the Champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...

381
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:57,997
and commanding him
with rights and lefts.

382
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,964
Up against the ropes, he's...

383
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:03,842
Boxing is an unnatural act.

384
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:07,236
'Cause everything in it
is backwards.

385
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:12,678
You want to move to the left,
you don't step left...

386
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,644
you push on the right toe.

387
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,118
To move right,
you use your left toe.

388
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:22,996
Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...

389
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,600
you step into it.

390
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,166
So Big Willie comes back...

391
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:30,603
He hits the champ with
a right hand and the champ is down.

392
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,287
The Ref is into the count
and Big Willie Jones

393
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,165
is the new champion of the world!

394
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:41,797
It's unbelievable how this
has taken place tonight...

395
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:45,004
but there you have it,
folks, a new champion.

396
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,195
Everything in boxing
is backwards.

397
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:05,116
Want a cheeseburger?

398
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:09,846
You bought me a cheeseburger? I never
seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

399
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:12,805
I couldn't eat it and
I ordered it. You want it?

400
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,676
I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

401
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:18,959
You watch the fight?

402
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:20,606
Yeah, I watched it.

403
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,039
Willie did good.

404
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,125
That's what you got to say?

405
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:28,403
Well, he won, didn't he?
He did good.

406
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:33,566
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. Good work.

407
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:35,400
You watch it?

408
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,519
Yeah, I got HBO.

409
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:41,037
How can you afford HBO?

410
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:44,517
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

411
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:47,436
Since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson

412
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:49,757
at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

413
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:52,120
That true?

414
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,203
Manager ran off and left
you and me to hitch home...

415
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:58,358
don't you remember nothing?

416
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:01,724
I remember walking halfway,
thinking I was gonna be lynched.

417
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:05,723
I remember you leaving me with my
dick in my hand behind that gas station.

418
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,125
I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

419
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:11,755
I had to walk back two miles.

420
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,927
Your conscience got the better
of you, that's what.

421
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:19,236
What the hell's that?

422
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,399
It's her birthday.

423
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:46,679
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

424
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,923
So, it's your birthday, huh?

425
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:51,998
How old does that make you?

426
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:56,436
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn, and I'm here
celebrating the fact...

427
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,802
that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

428
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,923
which is what
I been doing since 13.

429
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:05,086
And according to you, I'll be 37 before
I can even throw a decent punch...

430
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:08,324
which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

431
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,398
I now realize
may be God's simple truth.

432
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:14,196
Other truth is, my brother's in prison,
my sister cheats on welfare...

433
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:16,597
by pretending one
of her babies is still alive...

434
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:19,406
my daddy's dead
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

435
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,726
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

436
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,675
find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

437
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:30,803
Problem is, this is the only
thing I ever felt good doing.

438
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,925
If I'm too old for this,
then I got nothing.

439
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:36,525
That enough truth to suit you?

440
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:39,681
This your speed bag?

441
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:43,522
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

442
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:48,163
Just hold it. Hold it.

443
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:51,922
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

444
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:53,076
No, sorry.

445
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:55,477
You're in a position
to negotiate?

446
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,435
Yes, sir, because I know if you
train me right, I'm going to be a champ.

447
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,725
I seen you looking at me.

448
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,320
Yeah, out of pity.

449
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:08,036
Don't you say that! Don't you
say that if it ain't true!

450
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:10,396
I want a trainer.

451
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:14,284
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

452
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:21,439
If you're not interested, then
I got more celebrating to do.

453
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,684
Stop, stop, stop.

454
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:29,760
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

455
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:34,686
Okay.

456
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,084
If I'm going to take you on...

457
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,805
You won't never regret it.

458
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,162
Listen to me.
If I take you on...

459
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,045
I promise I'll work so hard.

460
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,516
God, this is a mistake already.

461
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:48,965
I'm listening, boss.

462
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:53,966
If I take you on, you don't say
anything, you don't question me.

463
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:58,206
You don't ask, "Why?" You don't say
anything except maybe "Yes, Frankie."

464
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,439
And I'm going to try to forget
the fact that you're a girl.

465
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:02,676
It's all I ask.

466
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,236
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

467
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,877
- All rightey.
- We got a deal.

468
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,158
No, not quite.

469
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,397
I'll teach you how to fight...

470
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,922
then we'll get you a manager
and I'm off down the road.

471
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:18,682
- I hate to argue with you but...
- That's the only way we're doing it.

472
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:22,317
I teach you all you need to know and
you go off and make a million dollars.

473
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:25,718
Get your teeth knocked out, I don't
care. I don't want to hear about it.

474
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:29,846
That's the way it's going to be.
It's the only way I'll do it.

475
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,116
All right.

476
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:45,042
One of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

477
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,244
You stand therejust flatfooted.
You've got to move your feet.

478
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,602
That's one of the best things
I'll be able to teach you.

479
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,917
So, here's what you do.

480
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,045
Get yourself,
bend your knees a little bit.

481
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:59,962
Get in an athletic position. Look
like you're going to hit something.

482
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:03,725
Move them how, boss?

483
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:04,956
Hit the bag.

484
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:08,558
- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?

485
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:10,718
You did two things wrong.

486
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:14,004
One is you asked a question and
two is you asked another question.

487
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:18,202
Now, what I want you to do
it's not about hitting it hard,

488
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,483
it's how good you hit it.

489
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,879
So, watch me. You can count
with me if you want.

490
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,641
On a one count, I hit
right through the bag.

491
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:28,718
Can you show me that again?

492
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,037
Just say one, please.

493
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:32,481
One.

494
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,081
One.

495
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,600
Okay. Yeah, just say one,
that's good.

496
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:41,726
Then I move over to my right foot.
My weight is shifting to my right foot.

497
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:46,686
Then I hit it with my back of my hand,
like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

498
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:50,280
Then I come over and
I shift to my left foot...

499
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:52,881
and I hit it with my right hand...

500
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,365
and ice pick maneuver again...

501
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,519
and I come over on my right foot,
and hit it right, left.

502
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,366
Don't watch anything
but my feet.

503
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:16,405
Just do it like that.
Just keep practicing.

504
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:49,806
You show them how to stand, keep
their legs under their shoulders.

505
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:01,123
To make a fighter, you got
to strip them down to bare wood.

506
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,835
Rest when you're dead.
Come here.

507
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,645
You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know...

508
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:14,401
because you got to make them
forget it in their bones.

509
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:22,446
Make them so tired they only listen
to you, only hear your voice...

510
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:25,560
only do what you say,
and nothing else.

511
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:28,243
Move your feet around,
let's see you go.

512
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:45,762
Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.

513
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,043
Not so low. Look at me.

514
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:56,638
How to generate momentum
off your right toe...

515
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,645
and how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.

516
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:10,446
How to fight backing up, so the other
guy doesn't want to come after you.

517
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:15,166
Then you got to show them all
over again. Over and over and over.

518
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:18,167
Till they think
they were born that way.

519
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,005
Shift. Shift away.

520
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:29,446
Okay, that's enough for today.
Good work. Good girl.

521
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,516
Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?

522
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,480
Come here.

523
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:03,440
You're not breathing.

524
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:06,685
Hate to disagree with you.

525
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:09,926
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

526
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,281
Now stop doing that.

527
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:15,796
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

528
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,959
I mean, for a girl.

529
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,685
I don't train girls.

530
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,483
You think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

531
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:27,844
We'll get a manager
and we'll find out, won't we?

532
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,806
I'd like to but you've been
keeping me too busy.

533
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,286
- Got any family, boss?
- What?

534
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,605
You been spending all this time
with me. I didn't know if you had any.

535
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:48,116
No.

536
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,076
Well, I've got a daughter. Katy.

537
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:53,956
That's family.

538
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:56,763
We're not exactly close.

539
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,520
How much she weigh?

540
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:00,756
What?

541
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:03,885
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

542
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:09,919
Not very big.

543
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:14,355
Used to be real athletic,
don't know if she kept it up.

544
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:22,557
So, what do you think?

545
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:25,599
I ready for a fight?

546
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:31,842
Hey, Sally.

547
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:35,886
Come here for a minute, will you?

548
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:40,405
Frankie? I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

549
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:41,841
Can I see you a minute?

550
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:46,320
Sally here's a real good manager.
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.

551
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,318
Looking for a girl, Sally?

552
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,239
I'm looking for a good one.

553
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,637
Well, see, there you go.

554
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:57,805
Nice working with you, girlie.

555
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,996
- What'd you want?
- Nothing.

556
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:07,639
I ain't lying, I been watching
you work. You got a hell of a left.

557
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:09,606
Thank you.

558
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,646
You want to give this a try,
see if it's a fit?

559
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:18,440
Yeah, sure.

560
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:22,163
Good, because I think
you're ready for a fight.

561
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:35,442
Break!

562
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:40,164
What am I doing wrong? Every
time I get inside, she's on me.

563
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,795
You're doing great. You're
wearing her down, just keep punching.

564
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,320
I ain't doing great.
I'm losing.

565
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,079
You're wearing her down.

566
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:09,400
Nice night, ain't it?

567
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,366
Jesus Christ.

568
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:14,324
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

569
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:17,240
Hell of a fighter. 11-0.

570
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:20,398
Your left. Keep your left up.

571
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:27,037
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

572
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:30,005
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

573
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:33,884
Your left, damn it.

574
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:38,766
Wouldn't have been my choice for a
first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

575
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:40,885
He must think she can take her.

576
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:43,766
Your left! Keep your left up.

577
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,647
You think she can
hear you from back here?

578
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:58,402
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

579
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:00,159
Might even help him.

580
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:02,319
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

581
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:06,446
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

582
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:09,442
Sally's trying to set
a fight with Adagio?

583
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:13,122
Hey, what do I know? Ljust
come because I enjoy the fights.

584
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,115
Mother of God.

585
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:18,406
Okay, break!

586
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:20,886
Come here.

587
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,600
Get over here!

588
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:25,839
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

589
00:42:26,007 --> 00:42:28,202
You mind if I talk to my fighter?

590
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,677
You're doing a hell of a job. Is this
the way you advise your lightweight?

591
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:36,241
- Dunn, what the hell are you doing?
- I'm talking. What are you doing?

592
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,238
- Is this your fighter?
- It's my fighter!

593
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:41,676
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

594
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:45,396
Fine. You take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

595
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,125
Somebody tell me what's going on!

596
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:49,243
I was late.
Sally was subbing for me.

597
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,396
This is your fighter?

598
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:56,122
Yeah. This is my fighter.

599
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,879
Then you got ten seconds!

600
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:01,244
I keep holding my left up, then
I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

601
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:03,318
- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

602
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:07,446
She thinks she knows you. Every time
you drop it she comes over the top.

603
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:11,044
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

604
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,118
And when she cocks
that big right hand...

605
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:14,163
I hear you.

606
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:17,285
Step to the side and come over
with a big good night hook.

607
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:18,516
Got it right here.

608
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,206
Fight or I'm calling it!

609
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:22,482
Go give it to her!

610
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:25,639
The body knows what fighters don't,
how to protect itself.

611
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:28,796
A neck can only twist so far.

612
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:32,755
Twist it just a hair more
and the body says:

613
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:36,636
I'll take it from here, because you
obviously don't know what you're doing.

614
00:43:39,207 --> 00:43:40,879
See the way she did that?

615
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:44,164
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

616
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,924
"Lie down, now,
rest and we'll talk

617
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,600
about thiswhen
you regain your senses."

618
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,166
It's called the knockout mechanism.

619
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,045
Don't get carried away, now.
You did good.

620
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,120
Thanks, boss.

621
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,607
You forgot the rule.
Now, what is the rule?

622
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:02,882
Keep my left up?

623
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:05,800
It's to protect yourself
at all times.

624
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,839
Now, what is the rule?

625
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:09,599
Protect myself at all times.

626
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:10,722
Good.

627
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,522
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

628
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:16,242
It wasn't.

629
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:18,526
It's okay.

630
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:20,960
I'll work on my left, boss.

631
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:22,480
Drink your water.

632
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,805
Other than that, how'd I do?

633
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:28,318
Fine. You did fine.

634
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,366
You going to leave me again?

635
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:34,642
Never.

636
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:39,286
That place you work, do they
have homemade lemon meringue pie?

637
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:40,916
Sure.

638
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,918
Not with the canned filling crap?

639
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:46,159
Big can, yea size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

640
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,125
I want you to take the weekend off.

641
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,436
It's only Thursday.

642
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:53,921
You going to argue with me?

643
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,125
Know better
than to do that, boss.

644
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:58,402
Good.

645
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:01,127
All fighters are pig-headed
some way or other.

646
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:04,962
Some part of them always thinks they
know better than you about something.

647
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:08,563
Can you spare a few minutes
for the lmmaculate Conception?

648
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:13,440
Truth is, even if they're wrong...

649
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:18,440
even if that one thing is going
to be the ruin of them...

650
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:22,316
if you can beat that last bit out of
them, then they ain't fighters at all.

651
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,045
Thought I said
I'd see you Monday.

652
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:25,481
You sure did, boss.

653
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:27,315
That was last night.

654
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:29,398
You said not to argue with you.

655
00:45:41,047 --> 00:45:43,686
Damn woman won't do
a thing I tell her.

656
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:45,519
You want my advice?

657
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:46,962
What?

658
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,646
Where are your shoes?

659
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:52,878
I'm airing out my feet.

660
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,319
You got big holes in your socks.

661
00:45:57,207 --> 00:45:59,004
They're not that big.

662
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:03,116
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

663
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:06,319
These are my sleeping socks.

664
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:09,916
My feet like
a little air at night.

665
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,922
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

666
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:15,885
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

667
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:20,795
Well, if I give you
some more money.

668
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:24,716
You buy some new socks
Please?

669
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,725
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

670
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,358
Might find its way to the track.

671
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:50,958
It's over! It's over!

672
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:09,087
Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.

673
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,600
I got the breathing thing down.

674
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:25,123
No, you ain't breathing, because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

675
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:26,402
Thought that was the point.

676
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,205
The point is to get good.

677
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:31,525
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out in the first round.

678
00:47:31,687 --> 00:47:33,166
How am I going to get you fights?

679
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:37,961
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed.

680
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:40,561
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

681
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,366
You haven't got
the lungs for six rounds.

682
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,644
I do if I keep knocking them
out in the first round.

683
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:53,364
Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...

684
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:55,597
just to let her know who was boss.

685
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:05,966
Sorry, boss.

686
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:08,238
Maggie left no doubt about it.

687
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:18,161
All right!

688
00:48:21,047 --> 00:48:24,119
Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.

689
00:48:41,207 --> 00:48:42,117
To your corner!

690
00:48:42,607 --> 00:48:44,040
Three, four,

691
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:45,717
five,

692
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:47,321
six, seven...

693
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,162
eight, nine, ten! It's over!

694
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,516
Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.

695
00:48:56,687 --> 00:49:00,202
After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.

696
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,804
Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...

697
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:11,323
sweetening the purse by paying
managers on the side.

698
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:25,362
That only worked for so long.

699
00:49:25,647 --> 00:49:28,366
Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.

700
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:30,599
He took a chance.

701
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:40,517
He moved her up in class.

702
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:43,324
That could've been a mistake.

703
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:10,602
Break! Step back! Break!

704
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:11,882
Time!

705
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,118
Damn, damn, damn.

706
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:24,682
I'm all right.

707
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,886
Give us two seconds, will you?
Just two seconds.

708
00:50:29,007 --> 00:50:31,077
Your nose is broke.

709
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:33,044
- Dang! Fix it.
- I can't.

710
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:34,162
You can fix it.

711
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:35,646
I can't.
I've got to call it.

712
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:37,638
I've seen what you can do!
Fix it!

713
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:40,526
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

714
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:42,086
The ring doctor's
going to call it.

715
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,636
Please, Frankie. If you
can stop the blood I can beat her.

716
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:48,565
Bite down on this.

717
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,116
Inhale.

718
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:09,198
- What?
- Inhale.

719
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,720
Breathe in!

720
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:22,756
Okay, huh?

721
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:24,201
Yeah, it's okay.

722
00:51:25,487 --> 00:51:29,446
You got 20 seconds before this turns
into a geyser and sprays the front row.

723
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:32,197
20 seconds, that's all you've got.

724
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,641
Now get going.

725
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,395
Go to your corner!

726
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:51,920
Two, three, four, five...

727
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,966
six, seven,

728
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:55,478
eight...

729
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:57,406
nine, ten!

730
00:52:00,807 --> 00:52:02,206
Mo Cuishle.

731
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:17,960
Whatcha reading?

732
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:20,396
What's she saying?

733
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:22,958
Wants to know what you're reading.

734
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,637
It's Yeats.
Keep your head back.

735
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:30,926
Why don't you talk a little Yeats
to her? Show her what a treat that is.

736
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,118
When the hell
they going to get to her?

737
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:35,879
I'm okay, Frankie.

738
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:39,885
- What'd you learn tonight?
- Always protect myself.

739
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:43,164
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

740
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,045
- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here!

741
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:50,606
I'll be right here.

742
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:03,676
How you doing?

743
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,516
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

744
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:07,120
I'm not the one who's hurt.

745
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:15,726
- Broken nose don't hurt that much.
- Why are you telling me that?

746
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,761
No reason.

747
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:23,476
But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.

748
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:28,366
And no matter how hard you work
at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.

749
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:30,285
Did you write your daughter?

750
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:31,562
Every week.

751
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:36,041
I've no idea
why you come to church.

752
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:10,366
After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple real good offers.

753
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:16,643
The first was to fight Billie
"The Blue Bear" Osterman...

754
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:18,286
for the WBAwelterweight title.

755
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:25,081
Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.

756
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,926
Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

757
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:49,719
Didn't seem to matter to her that
something like that could kill a person.

758
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,558
And the crowds loved her.

759
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:59,120
He turned it down
without even telling her.

760
00:54:59,607 --> 00:55:03,566
The next was to fight the British
champ, a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.

761
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:04,682
Hello?

762
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,320
Not interested.

763
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:12,563
He turned that down, too.

764
00:55:15,087 --> 00:55:16,918
That's a lot of money, boss.

765
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:20,478
You're making money. What
are you still working here for?

766
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,798
It's a title match, right?

767
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:25,765
Are you British? It's a title
you can't take away.

768
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,646
She's got nothing to lose.
You got nothing to win.

769
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:31,843
Might still be a good fight.

770
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,085
Yeah. I just brought you up
to welterweight.

771
00:55:35,927 --> 00:55:39,317
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

772
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:41,318
Didn't notice
I was fighting any contenders.

773
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:46,084
You can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

774
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:50,205
In fact, if you'd learn to protect
your face a little better...

775
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,756
I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

776
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:59,157
My face out there so much it's a
miracle I ain't been knocked out yet.

777
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,764
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

778
00:56:30,607 --> 00:56:32,484
I made us a reservation.

779
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:36,124
You might want to shower.

780
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:57,795
Here you go.

781
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:00,046
Here you go.

782
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:02,036
What's this?

783
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:05,526
It ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

784
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:07,966
Go on and blow.

785
00:57:12,607 --> 00:57:13,801
Thank you.

786
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:20,124
33 ain't so old.

787
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:23,642
I was still fighting at 39.

788
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:27,403
Fought for 23 years.

789
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,839
How's it going, Scrap?

790
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:34,726
Doing good, Mickey.

791
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:36,961
Doing good.

792
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:40,923
- What will you have?
- Coffee.

793
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:48,205
You two not speaking?

794
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,042
Don't hardly know him.

795
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:59,482
I met Frankie
right after my 37th birthday.

796
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,923
He was picking up cut work.

797
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,359
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

798
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:11,158
Good man to have in your corner.

799
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:13,560
Yes, he is.

800
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:18,484
He stayed with me through
my last fight in San Berdu.

801
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:22,005
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

802
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:25,925
and it was just Frankie and me.

803
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:30,522
I was taking a hellacious beating.

804
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:35,364
Everybody's got a particular
number of fights in them.

805
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:38,521
Nobody tells you
what that number is.

806
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:41,917
Mine was a 109.

807
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:45,401
I just didn't want to admit it.

808
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:48,360
Fourth round...

809
00:58:49,647 --> 00:58:51,205
this cut opens up.

810
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,922
Blood starts pouring
into my eye.

811
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:58,322
They should've stopped
the fight, but, hell...

812
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:02,241
I was a black man in San Berdu,
blood was what I was there for.

813
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:06,482
Round after round, I kept
getting Frankie to patch me up.

814
00:59:07,007 --> 00:59:09,077
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

815
00:59:09,247 --> 00:59:12,239
but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

816
00:59:13,207 --> 00:59:15,004
Round after round...

817
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:17,319
he's arguing with me.

818
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:22,682
I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

819
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:25,446
I go 15 rounds...

820
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:28,318
Iose by decision.

821
00:59:29,287 --> 00:59:31,562
Next morning,
I lose the eye.

822
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:37,283
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

823
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:41,762
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

824
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:47,206
Somehow Frankie thinks
he should've stopped that fight...

825
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:50,838
should've saved my eye.

826
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:57,316
Spends his life wishing
he could take back that 109th fight.

827
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:00,037
I wanted to go to 110.

828
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:02,840
Thing is...

829
01:00:03,727 --> 01:00:05,843
if you want to get to the title...

830
01:00:07,087 --> 01:00:09,681
maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

831
01:00:14,647 --> 01:00:16,763
You tell Mr. Mack
we'd be here tonight?

832
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:20,762
Eat your cupcake.

833
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,718
No, I got it.

834
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:30,602
It's the rule.

835
01:00:31,487 --> 01:00:33,318
Always protect yourself.

836
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:36,721
People never take
their own advice.

837
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:41,606
If she was going to leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.

838
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,358
Mr. Mickey Mack?
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

839
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:54,595
I hear you're a real good manager.
Doing good things for Big Willie.

840
01:00:56,727 --> 01:00:59,685
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

841
01:01:00,487 --> 01:01:03,445
so you don't need to make
any more excuses to bump into me.

842
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:06,918
Sorry for interrupting
your dinner.

843
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:15,075
Maggie always did like taking
them out in the first round.

844
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:50,403
The letters always came back
marked the same way...

845
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:52,764
"Return to Sender."

846
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:23,597
I will make you some coffee.

847
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,365
What are you doing
with your money?

848
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:28,676
Saving it.

849
01:02:28,847 --> 01:02:29,916
Good girl.

850
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:35,515
You save enough of it, you ought
to get yourself a little house.

851
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:36,642
Cash, no mortgage.

852
01:02:36,807 --> 01:02:39,002
It'll be a while
before I can do that.

853
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:47,160
It might be a stretch, but you got
to get yourself a place of your own.

854
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:51,037
Go around wasting it on things that
don't matter and what do you got?

855
01:02:51,447 --> 01:02:52,846
You understand?

856
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:56,443
Pretty soon, you wait
long enough, you got nothing.

857
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:58,838
Okay, soon as I get the money.

858
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:02,886
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm
trying to keep you from doing the same.

859
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:04,879
I know, boss.

860
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:07,565
I'm not going to live forever.

861
01:03:07,727 --> 01:03:08,842
What is it?

862
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:11,237
A tape on that girl
in England you'll fight.

863
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:13,682
If you're going to go for
the title, we got some moves to...

864
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:17,400
Get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

865
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,035
Thank you, boss.
Thank you so much.

866
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:24,246
You're welcome, darling.
Now let me put this in the machine.

867
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,120
What machine?

868
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:28,680
Don't have a TV, huh?

869
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:29,802
No.

870
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:31,962
Yeah!

871
01:03:33,327 --> 01:03:35,045
All right. Okay.

872
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:43,677
- Ten minutes, luv.
- Thank you.

873
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,640
Man says he loves me.

874
01:03:45,807 --> 01:03:47,923
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

875
01:03:48,087 --> 01:03:49,805
First since my daddy.

876
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:52,439
I win, you think he'll propose?

877
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,837
You win, I'll propose.

878
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:00,360
I've got you a gift here.

879
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:07,198
I think they gave you
somebody else's.

880
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,164
No. This is it.

881
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,001
What does it mean?

882
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,480
I don't know.
It's something in Gaelic.

883
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:17,686
It's beautiful.

884
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:20,119
I thought so.

885
01:04:20,287 --> 01:04:21,766
Real silk thread.

886
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,758
From the United States
of America,

887
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:29,446
the challenger...

888
01:04:29,607 --> 01:04:31,245
Maggie Fitzgerald!

889
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:36,363
Did you see what was on her robe?

890
01:04:36,527 --> 01:04:38,802
Yeah, Mo Cuishle.
Mo Cuishle!

891
01:04:42,807 --> 01:04:44,604
She wasn't the main attraction.

892
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,362
She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.

893
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:50,643
But ask someone who was there...

894
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:53,605
they couldn't tell you
who else fought that night.

895
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:00,362
Box!

896
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:25,157
Mo Cuishle! Mo Cuishle!

897
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:45,602
She's tough.

898
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:50,641
I can't get inside. I can't
get close enough to hit her.

899
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:53,082
- You know why that is?
- Why?

900
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:56,121
She's a better fighter than you are.

901
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:59,438
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced.

902
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:01,598
Now, what are you going
to do about it?

903
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:10,602
Get in there.

904
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:12,842
Box!

905
01:06:26,727 --> 01:06:30,686
Four, five, six...

906
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:34,638
seven, eight, nine, ten!

907
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,725
Mo Cuishle!

908
01:06:48,887 --> 01:06:50,286
Mo Cuishle!

909
01:06:57,207 --> 01:06:59,357
I could ask someone, you know?

910
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:00,962
Good.

911
01:07:01,327 --> 01:07:03,318
You find out,
you let me know.

912
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:12,561
Whatever it meant,
the name stuck.

913
01:07:13,047 --> 01:07:17,006
Maggie fought in Edinburgh
and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

914
01:07:17,527 --> 01:07:19,916
It was always "Mo cuishle".

915
01:07:20,607 --> 01:07:24,566
Seems there're Irish people
everywhere, or people who want to be.

916
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:27,921
By the time
they came back to the States...

917
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:31,281
Maggie was in a whole new league.

918
01:07:41,887 --> 01:07:45,084
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

919
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:04,842
After that they got another
offer to fight for the title.

920
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:08,520
What's the split?

921
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:11,637
- 60-40.
- Good.

922
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:15,835
We'll take sixty and you take forty,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

923
01:08:16,287 --> 01:08:17,686
That little girl?

924
01:08:18,087 --> 01:08:20,043
You think I'm wrong, really?

925
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:22,198
You think people are saying
that they want to see

926
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:25,165
some scabby Kraut beat up
on little Miss What's-her-name?

927
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:28,285
You find someone who says that
and we'll take the forty.

928
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:36,442
There you go.

929
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:43,082
They're at 60-40, but
they'll come up to 50-50.

930
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:45,640
How's that girl doing?

931
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:48,447
She's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

932
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:50,719
She be all right?

933
01:08:51,247 --> 01:08:52,680
And if she isn't?

934
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:55,079
Maybe I should send her something?

935
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:58,683
Well, you could send her your check,
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

936
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:04,477
Boss?

937
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:07,558
That little house we talked about?

938
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:09,321
I bought it.

939
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:12,079
Well, smart girl.

940
01:09:12,807 --> 01:09:13,956
For my mama.

941
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:16,516
It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

942
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:18,757
No mortgage,
just like you said.

943
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,325
You're a good daughter.

944
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,159
She don't know about it yet.

945
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:29,236
I was hoping maybe we could stay
an extra day, drive over there?

946
01:09:29,407 --> 01:09:31,079
I know she wants to meet you.

947
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:35,797
Yeah. We could do that.

948
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:54,841
Oh, my God.
Mama, come on out here.

949
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:57,319
Mary M's here.

950
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:15,884
This is the Johnson's old house.

951
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:17,685
Not anymore.

952
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:25,316
It's all yours, Mama! For you
and Mardell and the kids!

953
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:26,920
Mary M, you bought this for me?

954
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:29,157
Yeah, all yours,
free and clear!

955
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:30,601
Darling...

956
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:33,315
There's no fridge.
No stove, neither.

957
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:35,443
They'll be here
before you move in.

958
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:39,155
- How much money did this cost you?
- You never mind that.

959
01:10:39,327 --> 01:10:41,921
- You shouldn't a done this.
- You need a decent place.

960
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:45,204
You shouldn't a done it!
You should've asked me first!

961
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:49,046
Government's gonna find out about
this house, they'll stop my welfare.

962
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:50,845
Mama, no, they ain't.

963
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:55,046
You're fine, you're working, but
I can't live without my welfare.

964
01:10:55,407 --> 01:10:57,125
Mama, I send you money.

965
01:10:57,287 --> 01:11:00,199
What about my medicine?
Medicaid going to cut me off.

966
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:02,119
How am I supposed
to get my medicine?

967
01:11:02,287 --> 01:11:04,198
I'll send you more money.

968
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:08,076
Hope you don't expect J.D. To move
in here with us. He's getting out.

969
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:13,486
Why didn't you just give me the money?
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

970
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,558
Didn't have to, Mama.

971
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:22,166
But it's yours.
You want the money, sell it.

972
01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:40,606
I know you didn't mean nothing hurtful,
but you just don't think things through.

973
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:41,916
That's true, Mama.

974
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:46,166
I'll try and keep the house.
I just worry about all those expenses.

975
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:49,043
I'll send you some more money.

976
01:11:57,727 --> 01:11:59,524
That man hitting you?

977
01:12:01,327 --> 01:12:03,124
It's from the fight.

978
01:12:03,807 --> 01:12:05,399
I'm a fighter, Mama.

979
01:12:06,167 --> 01:12:08,078
Find a man, Mary M.

980
01:12:08,247 --> 01:12:09,726
Live proper.

981
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:12,840
People hear about what
you're doing and they laugh.

982
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,805
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

983
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:39,198
- You ever own a dog?
- Nope.

984
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:43,477
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

985
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:49,639
My daddy had
a German shepherd, Axel.

986
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:53,116
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

987
01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:56,836
he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

988
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:59,886
Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing,
watching him...

989
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:02,675
scoot across the kitchen floor.

990
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:07,315
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

991
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,882
But one morning he got up
and carried Axel to his rig...

992
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,756
and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

993
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:20,317
Wasn't till he got home
that night, alone, that I saw

994
01:14:20,607 --> 01:14:22,598
the shovel in the back
of the truck.

995
01:14:27,647 --> 01:14:30,400
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

996
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:41,356
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

997
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:46,164
Well, you've got me.

998
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:52,122
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

999
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:03,200
Hey, can we stopjust up here?

1000
01:15:04,527 --> 01:15:05,437
Yeah.

1001
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:09,485
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1002
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:12,121
None of that canned filling crap.

1003
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:28,722
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1004
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,444
I used to come here with Daddy.

1005
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:39,206
Wonder if a place like this
is for sale.

1006
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:41,164
I got a little bit of savings.

1007
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:50,124
That's fine. Fine, thanks.

1008
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:57,278
What the hell's Danger
looking at?

1009
01:15:57,927 --> 01:15:59,997
Looks like another
bottle of water.

1010
01:16:00,567 --> 01:16:02,478
Want to come to Vegas with us?

1011
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:05,237
Watch you suffer
over the nickel slots.

1012
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:07,796
My heart can't take
that kind of pounding.

1013
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:10,640
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1014
01:16:11,087 --> 01:16:13,396
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1015
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,398
That's good, Frankie.
That's real good.

1016
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:18,957
I could use a good second. Can't
find one, I thought I'd ask you.

1017
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:20,924
Why the hell
would I want to do that?

1018
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:25,406
Because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1019
01:16:25,567 --> 01:16:29,162
Thought you might like to feel what it's
like to be in a ring on a title match.

1020
01:16:29,327 --> 01:16:31,238
Excuse me for feeling
sorry for you.

1021
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,676
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1022
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:37,759
Somebody with young hands.

1023
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,919
You're not going to cry now,
are you? I've already got one girl.

1024
01:16:42,687 --> 01:16:44,439
No, I leave this place
for one day...

1025
01:16:44,607 --> 01:16:47,280
got any idea what it would look
like when I come back?

1026
01:16:47,447 --> 01:16:49,244
Kind of like
it looks right now.

1027
01:16:49,407 --> 01:16:50,806
Go to hell.

1028
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,167
Tell Maggie don't come back
without a belt.

1029
01:16:55,887 --> 01:16:57,161
Will do.

1030
01:17:01,247 --> 01:17:02,600
Mr. Scrap.

1031
01:17:03,247 --> 01:17:06,444
I got a question, but I feel
real stupid asking it.

1032
01:17:06,607 --> 01:17:09,838
No such thing as a stupid
question there, Danger.

1033
01:17:12,687 --> 01:17:16,396
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1034
01:17:16,847 --> 01:17:20,157
I been thinking on it.
Can't figure it out.

1035
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:22,643
Why don't I show you, Danger?

1036
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:25,321
You could show me?
I think so.

1037
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:29,886
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of
thinking I might be ready for a fight?

1038
01:17:30,047 --> 01:17:31,196
You do, do you?

1039
01:17:34,367 --> 01:17:36,597
Well, I got the tickets.
You ready?

1040
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:37,802
We're flying?

1041
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,878
Would you rather drive?

1042
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:42,958
You're asking me?

1043
01:17:43,447 --> 01:17:46,166
Would you rather fly
or would you rather drive?

1044
01:17:46,967 --> 01:17:48,923
So I finally get
to decide something?

1045
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:50,440
That's what I'm saying.

1046
01:17:50,887 --> 01:17:51,922
Fine.

1047
01:17:52,087 --> 01:17:53,964
Fly there, drive back.

1048
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:57,803
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard. How are we going to do that?

1049
01:17:57,967 --> 01:17:59,685
You said it was up to me.

1050
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:11,358
Give them hell there, Danger.

1051
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,360
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1052
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,236
Hey, Flippy,
come here for a minute.

1053
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:24,322
Jesus.

1054
01:18:25,407 --> 01:18:27,045
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1055
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:35,795
Dumb-ass.

1056
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,036
- Come on, Danger!
- Come on! Defense!

1057
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:44,846
Could be sitting up at
The Mirage, drinking mai tais...

1058
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:47,720
Iooking at naked women.

1059
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:50,685
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1060
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:04,165
Fight back! Come on!

1061
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:06,363
There you go, Danger,
there you go!

1062
01:19:19,247 --> 01:19:22,284
Come on, now, Flip!
What you doing? Let him go!

1063
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:24,240
I've gotcha now.

1064
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:28,200
It's all right.

1065
01:19:29,647 --> 01:19:31,319
We don't need no corner trainer!

1066
01:19:31,487 --> 01:19:33,000
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1067
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,646
You did good, Danger.

1068
01:19:34,807 --> 01:19:36,957
You my man. You rock.

1069
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:41,246
Come on, Flip. You ain't done.
You ain't even fight good yet.

1070
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:43,638
Anybody can lose
one fight, son.

1071
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:47,641
You'll come back from this,
you'll be champion of the world.

1072
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:49,963
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1073
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:52,879
I should've knowed.

1074
01:19:53,047 --> 01:19:55,003
Let's go, man,
we don't need this honky.

1075
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:56,759
- Let me help you.
- Naw, I can do her.

1076
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,282
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1077
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:05,757
Don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1078
01:20:07,327 --> 01:20:09,761
Mind if I borrow these, Danger?

1079
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:12,601
Man, I thought your name was Danger?

1080
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,280
Come on, now.

1081
01:20:15,327 --> 01:20:18,797
Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1082
01:20:19,327 --> 01:20:22,205
Call ESPN, 'cause
you can't write this shit!

1083
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:47,362
110.

1084
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,365
Get a job, punk.

1085
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:27,166
Win this one and
I'll tell you what it means.

1086
01:21:28,447 --> 01:21:30,438
I got you some pipers.

1087
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:50,281
Mo Cuishle! Mo Cuishle!

1088
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:53,206
I want you to jab her right in the tits,
until they turn blue and fall off.

1089
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:12,284
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is the feature presentation

1090
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:14,438
of the evening.

1091
01:23:14,807 --> 01:23:15,956
In this corner,

1092
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:19,164
the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald,

1093
01:23:19,607 --> 01:23:22,440
in the red corner.
In the blue corner,

1094
01:23:23,087 --> 01:23:27,046
the WBAWelterweight
champion of the world...

1095
01:23:28,527 --> 01:23:30,518
Billie "The Blue Bear".

1096
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:34,362
Sweet Jesus.

1097
01:23:49,927 --> 01:23:53,363
Fitzgerald is pushing the Blue Bear
around the ring, coming on strong.

1098
01:23:56,087 --> 01:23:59,124
Challenger darts in, lands
a combination to the head and the body.

1099
01:23:59,287 --> 01:24:01,323
And a right hook
stuns the champ!

1100
01:24:03,407 --> 01:24:04,522
Break it up!

1101
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:08,082
Break it!

1102
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:17,839
Do that one more time, it'll
cost you a point, do you hear me?

1103
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:21,166
Go fight.

1104
01:24:38,367 --> 01:24:40,722
What the fuck is that?

1105
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:43,481
That's it.
I'm going to take away a point.

1106
01:24:43,647 --> 01:24:45,797
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1107
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:50,400
Ref, open your eyes!

1108
01:25:07,607 --> 01:25:11,316
The first round is in the books
on this championship match.

1109
01:25:21,447 --> 01:25:22,402
Looking good.

1110
01:25:22,567 --> 01:25:25,877
You pull that crap one
more time, you're disqualified.

1111
01:25:33,647 --> 01:25:35,239
It's going to be all right.

1112
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:36,920
Got no doubt, boss.

1113
01:25:40,527 --> 01:25:43,644
You just watch yourself.
Stay away from this dame.

1114
01:25:43,887 --> 01:25:45,161
Go on.

1115
01:25:55,727 --> 01:25:58,446
Go to the neutral corner!

1116
01:25:59,847 --> 01:26:00,802
4, 5, 6...

1117
01:26:00,967 --> 01:26:02,366
Stay down, bitch.

1118
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:05,041
7, 8, 9...

1119
01:26:20,127 --> 01:26:21,401
Break it up!

1120
01:26:21,567 --> 01:26:22,636
Break it!

1121
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:32,955
Fitzgerald continues to pummel
the East German Champion...

1122
01:26:48,207 --> 01:26:49,401
I got it.

1123
01:26:55,847 --> 01:26:57,246
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1124
01:26:57,407 --> 01:27:00,080
- How many eyes you need to fight?
- One's enough.

1125
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:06,645
Now, what do I do about the Bear?

1126
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:09,560
Do you know that step into
the outside and hook into the liver?

1127
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:11,365
I been doing that.
She's made of steel.

1128
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,085
Don't go to the liver this time,

1129
01:27:13,247 --> 01:27:15,966
hit her right up
under her skinny ass.

1130
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:19,483
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1131
01:27:19,647 --> 01:27:21,399
Keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1132
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:22,602
What about the Ref?

1133
01:27:22,767 --> 01:27:26,282
Keep yourself between the Ref and
the Bear and everything will be fine.

1134
01:27:28,367 --> 01:27:31,404
This is you.

1135
01:27:56,367 --> 01:27:57,322
Break!

1136
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:37,966
Get the doctor!

1137
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:54,597
Come on. Breathe.

1138
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:58,361
That's it. Breathe.

1139
01:28:58,527 --> 01:28:59,596
Good.

1140
01:28:59,847 --> 01:29:01,724
Look at me.
Concentrate on me.

1141
01:29:02,847 --> 01:29:04,678
Breathe. Good.

1142
01:29:06,367 --> 01:29:08,039
That's it.

1143
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,599
Breathe. Good.

1144
01:29:56,527 --> 01:29:58,358
How you feeling, darling?

1145
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:08,597
Growing a beard, boss?

1146
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:12,160
Yeah, I thought it might
help me with the ladies.

1147
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:15,525
Can't say it does.

1148
01:30:42,247 --> 01:30:43,805
Does it hurt much?

1149
01:30:46,447 --> 01:30:48,278
Don't hurt at all.

1150
01:30:50,687 --> 01:30:52,245
Well, that's good.

1151
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,919
Where's Frankie?

1152
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:04,284
Well, he's out there
talking to the doctors.

1153
01:31:04,967 --> 01:31:07,640
Probably telling them
how to do their job.

1154
01:31:10,087 --> 01:31:13,363
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1155
01:31:17,767 --> 01:31:21,726
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1156
01:31:25,967 --> 01:31:28,845
Going to be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1157
01:31:33,607 --> 01:31:37,566
I asked them to tell him. I don't
know how he's going to take it.

1158
01:31:45,327 --> 01:31:47,318
Did you see the fight?

1159
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:51,246
Course I did.

1160
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:54,284
You had her cold, Maggie.

1161
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:58,037
I shouldn't a dropped my hands.

1162
01:32:02,527 --> 01:32:04,438
I shouldn't a turned.

1163
01:32:11,287 --> 01:32:15,246
Always protect myself,
how many times he tell me that?

1164
01:32:17,127 --> 01:32:18,082
Yeah.

1165
01:32:19,647 --> 01:32:21,717
Does like to repeat himself.

1166
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:27,921
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1167
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:33,402
No.

1168
01:32:34,527 --> 01:32:36,677
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1169
01:32:55,967 --> 01:32:57,559
Damnedest thing.

1170
01:33:01,167 --> 01:33:02,919
So, what's the plan?

1171
01:33:03,687 --> 01:33:06,759
I know you got one, so you
might as well tell me what it is.

1172
01:33:06,927 --> 01:33:08,440
It's your fault.

1173
01:33:09,327 --> 01:33:12,285
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1174
01:33:12,447 --> 01:33:14,244
You kept after me
until I trained her.

1175
01:33:14,647 --> 01:33:17,525
I knew I shouldn't have done it.
Her being a girl and all.

1176
01:33:18,487 --> 01:33:22,446
Everything kept telling me
not to. Everything but you.

1177
01:33:32,247 --> 01:33:33,999
I'm going to get you out of here.

1178
01:33:34,167 --> 01:33:36,681
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1179
01:33:36,847 --> 01:33:39,361
Otherwise why would they
be living out here in the desert?

1180
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:42,397
As soon as you're able
to be moved...

1181
01:33:42,567 --> 01:33:45,798
we'll find someplace where
they've actually studied medicine.

1182
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:50,678
You just rest there.

1183
01:33:52,487 --> 01:33:53,886
I'm on it.

1184
01:34:02,607 --> 01:34:05,167
Frankie must've called
every hospital in America...

1185
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:07,921
Iooking for somebody who'd
tell him they could fix her.

1186
01:34:08,087 --> 01:34:11,397
He came close twice till
they checked her over...

1187
01:34:12,327 --> 01:34:14,318
said there was nothing
to be done.

1188
01:34:14,727 --> 01:34:17,799
Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.

1189
01:34:22,767 --> 01:34:25,486
They got nurses
for that, you know.

1190
01:34:26,647 --> 01:34:28,797
Yeah, they're amateurs.

1191
01:34:40,247 --> 01:34:44,206
She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn't change positions.

1192
01:34:55,247 --> 01:34:56,600
Thank you.

1193
01:35:06,327 --> 01:35:09,399
They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.

1194
01:35:20,487 --> 01:35:22,637
Fly there, drive back.

1195
01:35:29,007 --> 01:35:32,716
The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.

1196
01:35:33,047 --> 01:35:36,801
They took good care of Maggie. She
wouldn't have complained if they hadn't.

1197
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:42,046
Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1198
01:35:47,127 --> 01:35:48,082
One, two, three.

1199
01:35:51,607 --> 01:35:55,566
Since she couldn't breathe on her
own, her respirators were always on.

1200
01:35:57,487 --> 01:35:59,921
Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.

1201
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:29,717
Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.

1202
01:36:29,887 --> 01:36:33,197
She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.

1203
01:36:35,727 --> 01:36:37,957
Frankie finally tracked them down

1204
01:36:38,127 --> 01:36:41,802
learned they'd checked
into their hotel six days earlier.

1205
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:45,398
Kept leaving messages,
which were never returned.

1206
01:36:49,327 --> 01:36:52,046
You don't have
to hang around all day.

1207
01:36:55,687 --> 01:36:57,803
I like it here. I don't mind.

1208
01:36:59,207 --> 01:37:02,916
Fact, if you weren't here, I'd
come here anyway to read my books.

1209
01:37:05,727 --> 01:37:08,685
Mama will be here soon,
share some of the burden.

1210
01:37:08,847 --> 01:37:10,599
Well, it's no burden.

1211
01:37:11,687 --> 01:37:12,642
Here...

1212
01:37:14,967 --> 01:37:16,366
read this.

1213
01:37:25,087 --> 01:37:26,998
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1214
01:37:27,327 --> 01:37:28,726
That's terrible.

1215
01:37:31,207 --> 01:37:34,040
Anyway, I'll tell you
in English what you were saying.

1216
01:37:36,967 --> 01:37:38,116
It says:

1217
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:41,838
"I will arise and go now,
and go to Innisfree.

1218
01:37:42,007 --> 01:37:45,556
And a small cabin build there,
of clay and wattles made.

1219
01:37:47,327 --> 01:37:51,286
And I shall have some peace there,
for peace comes dropping slow.

1220
01:37:52,047 --> 01:37:56,006
Dropping from the veils of the morning,
to where the cricket sings."

1221
01:37:58,847 --> 01:38:00,166
Not bad, huh?

1222
01:38:04,407 --> 01:38:07,046
You going to build
a cabin, boss?

1223
01:38:07,207 --> 01:38:08,162
Me?

1224
01:38:11,247 --> 01:38:13,715
You know,
when you quit all this.

1225
01:38:15,847 --> 01:38:17,166
You mean boxing?

1226
01:38:17,807 --> 01:38:19,718
No. I'll never quit.

1227
01:38:21,367 --> 01:38:23,722
Like the stink too much,
I guess.

1228
01:38:29,527 --> 01:38:33,486
You think? I could see you there, real
easy, with your books and lemon pie.

1229
01:38:36,367 --> 01:38:39,006
How about you? Would you like
to go live in a cabin?

1230
01:38:41,047 --> 01:38:43,277
I could learn how to bake.

1231
01:38:47,127 --> 01:38:49,800
Well, then,
maybe I'll start looking.

1232
01:39:11,607 --> 01:39:12,562
Yeah.

1233
01:39:21,607 --> 01:39:23,996
I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1234
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,395
Where's my little girl?

1235
01:39:25,567 --> 01:39:28,604
Don't you think you ought
to go back to the hotel and change?

1236
01:39:28,767 --> 01:39:31,122
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1237
01:39:31,287 --> 01:39:34,643
We got business with my sister. Why
don't you just tell us where she is?

1238
01:39:34,807 --> 01:39:37,685
You must be J.D. And you
must be the business guy?

1239
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:41,635
There's some rides you missed. Go on
back, I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1240
01:39:41,807 --> 01:39:43,843
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child

1241
01:39:44,007 --> 01:39:46,237
and you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1242
01:39:46,407 --> 01:39:48,523
Mary M can't go nowhere.

1243
01:39:48,687 --> 01:39:50,996
If we could have taken her
to Disneyland we would have.

1244
01:39:52,527 --> 01:39:53,596
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1245
01:39:54,087 --> 01:39:55,679
Right down here. 301.

1246
01:39:55,847 --> 01:39:57,599
- Come on, Mama.
- Let's go.

1247
01:40:03,807 --> 01:40:05,877
I saw myself breathing!

1248
01:40:06,087 --> 01:40:08,442
My body was going up and down.

1249
01:40:08,607 --> 01:40:11,326
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?!"

1250
01:40:13,767 --> 01:40:16,759
Your hair needs washing.
It's kinda greasy.

1251
01:40:32,607 --> 01:40:34,438
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1252
01:40:34,607 --> 01:40:35,562
What is it?

1253
01:40:36,047 --> 01:40:37,799
How we all doing here?

1254
01:40:38,447 --> 01:40:41,439
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lotta time.

1255
01:40:41,607 --> 01:40:45,122
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot to be
here to make sure this is done proper.

1256
01:40:45,287 --> 01:40:47,562
Leave that and
I'll read it to her later.

1257
01:40:47,727 --> 01:40:49,240
Hey, old man...

1258
01:40:49,407 --> 01:40:50,920
you part of our family?

1259
01:40:51,807 --> 01:40:53,320
Stay the hell out of this.

1260
01:40:54,927 --> 01:40:56,246
Read it to me, Mama.

1261
01:40:56,407 --> 01:40:57,965
It'sjust something legal...

1262
01:40:58,127 --> 01:41:00,083
to protect your money.

1263
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:02,326
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1264
01:41:03,087 --> 01:41:06,397
The Boxing Commission's paying
for all this. Everything.

1265
01:41:06,567 --> 01:41:08,842
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1266
01:41:09,007 --> 01:41:11,646
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1267
01:41:11,807 --> 01:41:14,799
If you assign your assets to her,
no one will be able to touch them.

1268
01:41:14,967 --> 01:41:16,798
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1269
01:41:17,727 --> 01:41:19,080
Nothing.

1270
01:41:19,247 --> 01:41:22,603
Why don't you just leave it and then
I'll just read it to her later on?

1271
01:41:22,767 --> 01:41:24,325
Mr. Dunn, with respect,
this isn't your business.

1272
01:41:25,767 --> 01:41:28,076
I'll be out in the hall.

1273
01:41:34,167 --> 01:41:36,397
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1274
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:41,926
You sign that paper, it'll
take care of your family...

1275
01:41:42,327 --> 01:41:44,397
the way your daddy
would have wanted you to.

1276
01:41:49,007 --> 01:41:51,077
How do you make your mark?

1277
01:41:52,047 --> 01:41:54,561
Can you hold a pen?

1278
01:41:54,727 --> 01:41:56,957
She gotta do it
with her teeth, Mama.

1279
01:41:57,127 --> 01:41:59,197
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1280
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:01,516
Here you go, honey.

1281
01:42:05,047 --> 01:42:07,003
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1282
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:09,357
Honey, you know
how I feel about that.

1283
01:42:10,847 --> 01:42:12,360
I did pretty good.

1284
01:42:12,527 --> 01:42:14,438
You lost, Mary M.

1285
01:42:15,247 --> 01:42:18,683
Ain't your fault, the way
I heard it, but you lost.

1286
01:42:20,407 --> 01:42:23,160
Don't want to lose the rest
of what you got left.

1287
01:42:23,647 --> 01:42:24,921
There you go.

1288
01:42:33,807 --> 01:42:35,638
What happened to you?

1289
01:42:35,927 --> 01:42:37,565
What's that supposed to mean?

1290
01:42:39,407 --> 01:42:42,638
Mama, you take Mardell
and J.D. And get home.

1291
01:42:44,327 --> 01:42:47,717
Before I tell that lawyer there that you
were so worried about your welfare

1292
01:42:47,887 --> 01:42:50,879
you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1293
01:42:53,487 --> 01:42:55,125
So, any time I feel like it,

1294
01:42:55,287 --> 01:42:59,166
I can sell that house from under
your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.

1295
01:43:01,047 --> 01:43:04,278
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1296
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:47,516
Well, maybe someone
ought to count to ten.

1297
01:44:00,847 --> 01:44:02,917
Don't smell real pretty,
does it, Doc?

1298
01:44:05,687 --> 01:44:07,279
We might have to lose it,
Maggie.

1299
01:45:21,327 --> 01:45:23,557
They took my leg, boss.

1300
01:45:28,607 --> 01:45:30,962
It's gonna be all right.
You hear?

1301
01:45:31,927 --> 01:45:34,487
I always hear your voice, boss.

1302
01:46:05,407 --> 01:46:07,045
You need anything?

1303
01:46:10,567 --> 01:46:13,240
I need to know
what Mo Cuishle means.

1304
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:18,766
Well, you didn't win.
I don't have to tell you.

1305
01:46:22,527 --> 01:46:24,916
You're the meanest man
I ever met,

1306
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:27,476
no wonder no one loves you.

1307
01:46:30,847 --> 01:46:32,883
You remind me of my daddy.

1308
01:46:35,727 --> 01:46:37,524
Well, he must have been

1309
01:46:37,927 --> 01:46:40,725
a very intelligent,
handsome man.

1310
01:46:45,087 --> 01:46:47,806
You ain't gonna make me
talk no more Yeats, are you?

1311
01:46:49,807 --> 01:46:51,001
No, I was...

1312
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:55,326
Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1313
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:00,000
I thought I'd get you
a wheelchair...

1314
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:03,557
maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1315
01:47:04,247 --> 01:47:07,045
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1316
01:47:11,887 --> 01:47:14,321
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1317
01:47:16,527 --> 01:47:17,676
Sure.

1318
01:47:19,607 --> 01:47:21,279
Anything you want.

1319
01:47:23,047 --> 01:47:25,720
Remember what my daddy
did for Axel?

1320
01:47:38,287 --> 01:47:40,198
Don't even think about that.

1321
01:47:44,287 --> 01:47:46,562
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1322
01:47:49,687 --> 01:47:53,282
Not after what I've done.
I seen the world.

1323
01:47:56,447 --> 01:47:58,517
People chanted my name.

1324
01:47:59,407 --> 01:48:00,556
Well...

1325
01:48:02,567 --> 01:48:05,639
not my name,
some damn name you gave me...

1326
01:48:08,687 --> 01:48:10,643
but they were chanting for me.

1327
01:48:14,527 --> 01:48:16,757
I was in magazines.

1328
01:48:20,407 --> 01:48:22,921
You think I ever dreamed
that'd happen?

1329
01:48:27,247 --> 01:48:30,762
I was born at two pounds,
one-and-a-half ounces.

1330
01:48:34,047 --> 01:48:37,278
Daddy used to tell me I fought
to get into this world...

1331
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:42,922
and I'd fight my way out.

1332
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:49,882
That's all I want
to do, Frankie.

1333
01:48:52,607 --> 01:48:54,757
I just don't want
to fight you to do it.

1334
01:48:57,647 --> 01:48:59,000
I got what I needed.

1335
01:49:02,967 --> 01:49:04,764
I got it all.

1336
01:49:08,767 --> 01:49:11,520
Don't let them
keep taking it away from me.

1337
01:49:16,647 --> 01:49:20,606
Don't let me lie here till I can't
hear those people chanting no more.

1338
01:49:26,087 --> 01:49:27,600
I can't.

1339
01:49:29,007 --> 01:49:30,156
Please...

1340
01:49:32,807 --> 01:49:34,957
please, don't ask me.

1341
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:38,919
I'm asking.

1342
01:49:42,647 --> 01:49:44,046
I can't.

1343
01:50:26,647 --> 01:50:27,762
Hello?

1344
01:50:33,687 --> 01:50:37,646
In the middle of the night,
Maggie had found her own solution.

1345
01:50:39,247 --> 01:50:40,919
She had bit her tongue.

1346
01:50:48,127 --> 01:50:49,799
Stop. Stop.

1347
01:50:54,127 --> 01:50:56,083
Look at me. Look at me.

1348
01:51:10,487 --> 01:51:13,206
Nearly bled to death before
they stitched her up.

1349
01:51:14,367 --> 01:51:17,962
She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.

1350
01:51:19,007 --> 01:51:22,966
They stitched her up again, padded
the tongue so she couldn't bite.

1351
01:51:41,927 --> 01:51:43,963
You can't do it,
you know that.

1352
01:51:45,727 --> 01:51:47,399
I do, Father.

1353
01:51:48,647 --> 01:51:52,606
You don't know how thick she is,
how hard it was to train her.

1354
01:51:53,527 --> 01:51:56,803
Other fighters would do exactly
what you say to them and...

1355
01:51:57,407 --> 01:52:01,366
and she'd ask why this and why
that and do it her own way, anyway.

1356
01:52:03,047 --> 01:52:05,402
How she fought for the title, I...

1357
01:52:05,567 --> 01:52:09,162
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1358
01:52:18,807 --> 01:52:22,766
But now she wants to die, and
I just want to keep her with me.

1359
01:52:27,887 --> 01:52:29,923
And I swear to God, Father...

1360
01:52:32,047 --> 01:52:34,607
it's committing
a sin by doing it.

1361
01:52:34,847 --> 01:52:37,725
By keeping her alive,
I'm killing her.

1362
01:52:38,527 --> 01:52:41,405
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1363
01:52:42,807 --> 01:52:46,766
You don't. You step aside,
Frankie. You leave it with God.

1364
01:52:48,327 --> 01:52:52,002
She's not asking for God's
help. She's asking for mine.

1365
01:52:52,367 --> 01:52:55,598
Frankie, I've seen you at mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1366
01:52:55,767 --> 01:52:59,282
Someone who comes here that much
can't forgive himself for something.

1367
01:52:59,447 --> 01:53:01,722
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1368
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:04,602
they're nothing compared to this.

1369
01:53:05,047 --> 01:53:08,164
Forget about God...
or Heaven and Hell.

1370
01:53:09,167 --> 01:53:12,079
If you do this thing,
you'll be lost...

1371
01:53:15,407 --> 01:53:17,398
somewhere so deep...

1372
01:53:19,327 --> 01:53:21,636
you'll never find
yourself again.

1373
01:53:50,927 --> 01:53:53,805
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1374
01:54:56,687 --> 01:54:58,837
I went to see Maggie
this morning.

1375
01:55:00,767 --> 01:55:02,758
You must have been
somewhere else.

1376
01:55:04,087 --> 01:55:05,042
Yeah.

1377
01:55:09,367 --> 01:55:11,358
You got a fight
I don't know about?

1378
01:55:16,367 --> 01:55:18,244
It wasn't your fault.

1379
01:55:19,167 --> 01:55:21,203
I was wrong to say that.

1380
01:55:21,447 --> 01:55:22,960
You're damn right.

1381
01:55:24,607 --> 01:55:25,926
I found you a fighter...

1382
01:55:26,087 --> 01:55:29,079
and you made her the best
fighter she could be.

1383
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:33,366
And I killed her.

1384
01:55:33,527 --> 01:55:34,926
Don't say that.

1385
01:55:35,687 --> 01:55:38,247
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts...

1386
01:55:38,407 --> 01:55:41,319
no chance in the world
of being what she needed to be.

1387
01:55:41,487 --> 01:55:44,923
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1388
01:55:45,087 --> 01:55:46,122
You did that.

1389
01:55:48,327 --> 01:55:50,477
People die every day, Frankie...

1390
01:55:50,767 --> 01:55:52,598
mopping floors,
washing dishes.

1391
01:55:52,847 --> 01:55:56,806
And you know what their last
thought is? I never got my shot.

1392
01:55:57,887 --> 01:56:00,037
Because of you,
Maggie got her shot.

1393
01:56:01,287 --> 01:56:04,165
If she dies today, you know
what her last thought will be?

1394
01:56:05,687 --> 01:56:07,882
"I think I did all right."

1395
01:56:15,247 --> 01:56:17,317
I know I could rest with that.

1396
01:56:20,167 --> 01:56:21,122
Yeah.

1397
01:56:21,887 --> 01:56:23,081
Yeah.

1398
01:56:34,047 --> 01:56:35,162
Yeah.

1399
01:57:12,607 --> 01:57:13,756
I'll get a cup of coffee.

1400
01:57:41,407 --> 01:57:42,522
All right.

1401
01:57:46,807 --> 01:57:49,162
I'm gonna disconnect
your air machine...

1402
01:57:50,007 --> 01:57:51,918
then you're gonna go to sleep.

1403
01:57:56,687 --> 01:57:58,996
Then I'll give you a shot

1404
01:58:00,407 --> 01:58:01,886
and you'll stay asleep.

1405
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:08,726
Mo Cuishle...

1406
01:58:10,247 --> 01:58:13,125
means "my darling, my blood."

1407
01:59:18,927 --> 01:59:20,997
He gave her a single shot.

1408
01:59:22,007 --> 01:59:25,636
It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.

1409
01:59:26,367 --> 01:59:28,927
He didn't want her
going through this again.

1410
02:00:16,847 --> 02:00:18,519
Then he walked out.

1411
02:00:19,247 --> 02:00:21,966
I don't think
he had anything left.

1412
02:00:40,207 --> 02:00:42,038
I went back to the gym.

1413
02:00:42,647 --> 02:00:45,719
Waited, figuring
he'd turn up sooner or later.

1414
02:01:04,847 --> 02:01:07,725
And that's when a ghost
came through the door.

1415
02:01:10,647 --> 02:01:13,480
I got to thinking
what you said, Mist' Scrap.

1416
02:01:14,527 --> 02:01:16,165
What was that, Danger?

1417
02:01:17,847 --> 02:01:20,202
Anybody can lose one fight.

1418
02:01:21,447 --> 02:01:22,960
That's the truth.

1419
02:01:24,007 --> 02:01:26,396
Put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1420
02:01:28,287 --> 02:01:30,482
Will do, Mist' Scrap.

1421
02:01:48,767 --> 02:01:51,156
Frankie never came back at all.

1422
02:02:05,847 --> 02:02:09,157
Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.

1423
02:02:10,207 --> 02:02:12,243
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...

1424
02:02:12,647 --> 02:02:15,639
and ask you one more time
to forgive him.

1425
02:02:15,807 --> 02:02:18,958
But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.

1426
02:02:19,407 --> 02:02:22,604
I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.

1427
02:02:22,967 --> 02:02:25,720
A place set
in the cedars and oak trees.

1428
02:02:26,447 --> 02:02:29,405
Somewhere between
nowhere and good-bye.

1429
02:02:29,567 --> 02:02:32,161
But that's probably
wishful thinking.

1430
02:02:33,407 --> 02:02:35,443
No matter where he is...

1431
02:02:36,007 --> 02:02:39,795
I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.

1432
02:02:40,795 --> 02:02:50,795
