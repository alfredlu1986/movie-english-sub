00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,541
Not tomorrow. The day after. Right.

2
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,339
You, me, Gary, Brad. We'll
be teeing off at...

3
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,972
- I like Gary.
- Doctor, I'm in a hurry...

4
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:56,509
We'll tee off at 7:30. If you're not there
because of Gary, come on. I gotta go.

5
00:00:57,888 --> 00:00:59,549
Am I missing something?

6
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,957
Why a head X-ray
when the man was bitten on the hand?

7
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:06,451
The patient was in a barfight.
He was admitted at six.

8
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:10,228
That's 6:00 AM.
That's when I started my shift.

9
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:12,394
Where is he now? I'd like to see him.

10
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:16,100
- They moved him. A night nurse...
- Page me when you find him.

11
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,404
Sure.

12
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:20,445
I'll do that.

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,405
Cora, can you locate a patient for me?

14
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,781
Hey, Ana. Sure.

15
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,082
- Edward Solomon?
- Yep.

16
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,557
- Aren't you off?
- An hour ago.

17
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:39,720
Here he is. They had him backwards.
Solomon Edward. He's in ICU.

18
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,199
- From a bite?
- I don't know what from.

19
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:45,135
Toxicology's working him up tomorrow.

20
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,765
- I'm going. Can you let Dr. Dandewar know?
- Sure.

21
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:52,175
- Thanks.
- Did you talk to Luis about Sunday?

22
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,543
- I will. Night, Cora.

- Not bad. You?

Good. I'm trading shifts with Cora
so if I take Sunday,

00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:18,764
Shatterproof, asshole.

160
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,300
Shit.

161
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,541
- What happened?
- Come on, move.

162
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,703
Move!

163
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,307
- Which way?
- Here. Elevators.

164
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,911
Let's go, let's go!

165
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:01,236
Can I see that arm?

166
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,367
I need to suture that.

167
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,802
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

168
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,647
- Find someplace else.
- We just need a place...

169
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:21,820
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- There is no place else.

170
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,661
Tough shit. This is our place
and you can't stay here.

171
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,667
Yeah. And you already trashed Metropolis.

172
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,159
My wife is pregnant. We can't run.

173
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,733
- His arm...
- Those things are down there.

174
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:38,506
These are your problems, not mine.

175
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:41,276
If I put my foot up your ass,
would that be your problem?

176
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:45,615
Hey, asshole, I'm the one
pointing the gun at you.

177
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:47,416
He is a cop, CJ.

178
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:50,912
So what?

179
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,984
We're not gonna cause any trouble.

180
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:57,759
Just let us stay here
for a little while. Please.

181
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:07,737
OK. Come out slowly
and give your weapons to Bart and Terry.

182
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:09,902
- Don't do it.
- You must be crazy.

183
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:13,210
You can take your ass on over
to Quality Inn, Shaq.

184
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:16,614
Huh? You want to do that?

185
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,853
Let's go.

186
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:22,253
Hey, don't give him that gun.

187
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,656
Fuck.

188
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,562
Smart move.

189
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:40,268
'Nobody knows what's going on.
There's a lot of blood and bodies.

We're going back to a live picture now.'

191
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:54,787
'One second. Ma'am, are you American?'

192
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:03,689
All right. Let's go, guys.

193
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:07,897
Come on. Get your own little TV.
Come on. Let's go.

194
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,975
Excuse me.
Please. Is there a restroom?

195
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,342
No. You're staying here.

196
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:20,281
Then tell us where in here
you'd like us to piss.

197
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:25,886
It's around the corner, that way.

198
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:28,482
Whoa, where are you going?

199
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:30,891
She's not going anywhere alone.

200
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:35,626
"She's not going anywhere..." This is a
fucking nursery school! Go with them.

201
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:38,863
'I'm Bill Vibert for 23-V Cable News.

Twitcher!

209
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:03,149
Now, that is one cool motherfucker.

210
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,992
He's still bleeding. I
need to stitch his arm.

211
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:10,558
- You a fucking doctor?
- No, I'm a fucking nurse.

212

- 'I know some of these people.'
- First aid kit's in the office.

'What are you gonna do?
It's gotta be done.'

- Huh? What did I tell you boys?
- 'Get those bodies off the truck!'

215
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:28,984
America always sorts its shit out.

You're lucky. He could have bitten it off.

our search-and-rescue teams will find you.'

What's the holdup, darling?

224

Hm?

225
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,599
So what's the plan?

226
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:58,976
The plan is you drink a tall glass
of shut-the-fuck-up.

227
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:02,141
OK. That's one idea.

228
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:07,482
What about locking this place down?
Sooner or later, they'll get in.

229
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,114
That's good. I hadn't thought of that.

230
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:17,256
No doubt. You probably already thought
about putting a sign up on the roof

231
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:20,698
cos there's still planes in the air.

232
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:24,226
Might be good to let them know we're alive.

233
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:40,220
We can get paint from Case Hardware.
Use doors to board up the weak spots.

234
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:42,756
That's a solid plan.

235
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,986
CJ, is it?

236
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,891
- Yeah.
- All right, CJ.

237
00:29:56,004 --> 00:30:01,169
Listen up. I'm giving
everybody a job and I expect you to do it.

238
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:04,110
I don't want to see any half-assin'.

239
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:07,706
You can start by cleaning up
that mess you made in Metropolis.

Hey, CJ, look!

241
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,047
Terry.

242
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:16,091
Look at Ben Cozine.

243
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:22,392
Hey, Ben. Ben!

244
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,831
Christ. Look at him.

245
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:28,328
Look, he's a twitcher.

246
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:34,909
TV says you gotta shoot 'em in the head.

247
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,071
TV said a lot of things.

248
00:30:37,113 --> 00:30:40,981
Fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.

249
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:02,266
Let's go. Let's get to work.

250
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:06,970
Holy shit.

251
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:32,026
- Let's do it.
- All right, let's pick him up, then.

252
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:35,470
Ready? One, two, three.

253
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:37,497
On two. All right?

254
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,238
One, two.

255
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:45,677
What are they?

256
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,845
I don't know. Why are they coming here?

257
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:54,017
Memory, maybe. Instinct.
Maybe they're coming for us.

258
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:04,294
Look over there.
There's someone on the roof.

259
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:10,739
His name's Andy. He's alone.

260
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:14,645
He may as well be on the moon.

261
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,739
Poor guy.

262
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:21,543
What's he pointing at?

263
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:26,515
- Helicopter.
- Hey, it's coming.

264
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:31,795
Fuckin' A, man!

265
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,526
- Hey!
- Hey!

266
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,501
- Hey!
- Where's he...?

267
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:40,630
Please... What's he doing?
Where's he going?

268
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:49,074
No. I mean, they saw us, so...

269
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:53,449
They'll be coming back, baby.
Don't worry. They'll send somebody.

270
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:57,946
It's safe here.
We'll just wait for them to come back.

271
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:20,010
I don't want anybody
sneaking around and stealing shit.

272
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,240
Comprende?

273
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,244
Sweet dreams.

274
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,658
Those assholes are gonna get us killed.

275
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,097
We have to do something.

276
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:45,128
I'm not doing anything
to create problems for Luda and me.

277
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:48,539
- The helicopter's coming back soon.
- I hope so.

278
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,545
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's means it might come and it might not.

279
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:57,881
What do you mean?
You said it was coming back!

280
00:33:57,918 --> 00:34:01,855
- We have to get to hospital.
- Baby, listen. Don't worry, OK?

281
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,223
This guy, he doesn't know shit.

282
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,386
All right? It's coming back.

283
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:13,458
My man, I hear you talking a lot,
you're always saying something,

284
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:16,163
who the fuck are you that we should listen?

285
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:20,402
Were you like in the Marines?
What the fuck do you do?

286
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,441
I sell televisions at Best Buy.

287
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,877
Wow.

288
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:38,893
Hey, Officer, how do you like
following a guy that sells TVs?

289
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:42,386
About as much as I like
following a guy who steals them.

290
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:49,037
I'm not following anyone.
I'm going to Fort Pastor to get my brother.

291

- This is shit. The same thing all day.

I would have tapped that shit.

00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:31,802

What the hell?

321
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,668
- Hey, dumb-ass.
- Hm?

322
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:31,262
It's the timers. It's eight o'clock.

323
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:33,864
Terry.

324
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,875
- Go shut 'em off.
- It's Bart's turn.

325
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:40,305
You're the trainee, man.

326
00:37:40,347 --> 00:37:42,645
Shit rolls downhill.

327
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:47,914
I wish somebody
was working at Hallowed Grounds.

328
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,386
How hard is it to make coffee?

329
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:54,053
I wanted a soya mocha latte with foam.

330
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:57,656
Faggot.

331
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:04,266
What are you doing?

332
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:11,571
What's the news?

333
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:13,580
Bad.

334
00:38:18,986 --> 00:38:21,079
Hey! Hey!

335
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:24,091
Hey.

336
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,219
What?

337
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:30,293
The bathroom in here is
fake, it doesn't work.

338
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:36,696
- I'll tell CJ.
- I'm telling you.

339
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,824
You're the type of cat that goes to church
and all that shit, right?

340
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,958
Yeah, I do all that shit.

341
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:10,396
So what do you think?

342
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:14,501
What is this? Is this the end of times?

343
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:18,580
Cos if it is, I'm fucked.

344
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:22,382
I'm serious. I've done some bad things.

345
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:27,948
Oh, I get it. You saw hell yesterday,

346
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,290
now you're scared of going to hell
for all the bad things you've done.

347
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,421
Go in the stall, say five Hail Marys,

348
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:37,797
wipe your ass,
and you and God can call it even.

349
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:50,006
You think I feel like I deserve to be here?

350
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,015
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't.

351
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,847
And I'm cool with that.

352
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:58,878
But that's not it.
I feel like I'm here for another reason.

353
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:05,728
I feel like I'm here
to bring that baby on this earth

354
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:08,526
and give it everything that I never had.

355
00:40:12,636 --> 00:40:16,333
I just want the opportunity
to change things.

356
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,924
Shit!

357
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:55,042
CJ!

358
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,413
How did you get out?
Who said you could loot the stores?

359
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,817
- What are we going to do about that truck?
- Nothing.

360
00:41:01,854 --> 00:41:06,348
- There's people in it.
- How do you know they're not fucked up?

361
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:09,555
For one thing, they're driving a truck.

362
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:11,654
Oh, and shooting guns.

363
00:41:11,697 --> 00:41:16,725
We might let the wrong ones in.
Then I'm dead. And I don't want to die.

364
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:21,865
- Who are the wrong ones?
- Nobody here is sick. It stays that way.

365
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,637
- I think...
- I did not ask for your opinion!

366
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,679
- If you want to argue, argue with this.
- Relax.

367
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:29,943
Shut your fucking mouth.

368
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,817
- Move the gun.
- You can't turn them away. They'll die.

369
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:38,119
Tough shit. Self-defense.

370
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:41,519
- I won't kill anybody.
- I'll kill you.

371
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:45,258
- Stop it, CJ. Don't do this.
- Shut up!

372
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,698
I'll kill all of you to stay alive.

373
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:49,964
Get the fucking gun out of my face!

374
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:54,269
- Oh. You got a mouth on you.
- Somebody should show her how to use it.

375
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:06,149
- Is there a holding cell?
- Yeah. Back of the security room.

376
00:42:06,186 --> 00:42:10,088
That's real good.
You're gonna get us all killed, dumb-ass!

377
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:12,182
Fucking traitor.

378
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:14,820
Get off me.

379
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:17,160
I hope you got a good plan.

380
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,524
Come on.

381
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:37,081
- Hey!
- Through here.

382
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:45,755
- I can't see a damn thing.
- Me, either.

383
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:51,866
Why is he backing up the truck?

384
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,105
- Through here!
- Hey!

385
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:09,082
Shit.

386
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:11,347
What the fuck?

387
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:15,152
- We gotta go out there.
- Throw that bullshit out of your head.

388
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,351
That's not part of the plan.

389
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,860
Change of plan. I'll open the door.

390
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:21,362
No.

391
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:23,830
OK. One, two...

392
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:25,594
- Don't do it, man.
- ...three.

393
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:29,730
Come on, man.

394
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:31,330
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

395
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:37,913
Shoot them in the head!

396
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:40,741
I don't see anybody.

397
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:43,783
- Get back inside!
- Get back inside!

398
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,052
- Here you go.
- There are six more people in the truck!

399
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:49,922
Andre!

400
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:11,808
Thank God. I couldn't stay
in that fucking truck anymore.

401
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:19,186
Anybody who's injured,
go to Metropolis. I'll take a look at you.

402
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,657
Let me take a look at her.

403
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,092
Can you help me? What's your name?

404
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:29,463
Glen. Yeah, sure.
Just give me a second to collect myself.

405
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,991
- Thanks.
- OK.

406
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,094
Wait in there. I'll look at your leg.

407
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,166
- Can you hold this?
- Yeah.

408
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,302
- We're just going right there.
- Oh, my arm.

409
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,745
We'll make you nice and comfortable.

410
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,147
We got plenty of food and water.

411
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,953
Help should be along soon.

412
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:54,049
Help? You hear that from the same jackass
who said to go to St. Verbena?

413
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,060
- The church downtown?
- Yeah.

414
00:44:56,094 --> 00:45:01,794
It's the first place I went. Some dipshit on
the radio said it was safe. He was wrong.

415
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,460
That's where you got them?

416
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:08,268
I got a call on the CB from Glen
saying these folks were in the chapel.

417
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,070
- He's a priest?
- No, he plays the organ.

418
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,238
I was in the neighborhood
so I picked them up.

419
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,110
- Well done.
- Thanks.

420
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:23,622
Excuse me, when you two fellows
are done blowing each other,

421
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:26,624
maybe Davy Crockett can tell us the deal.

422
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,626
Since the TVs went down...

423
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:33,428
- Excuse me. Whose rig is that?
- It's mine.

424
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:36,799
- You mind if I borrow it?
- I'm not using it.

425
00:45:36,836 --> 00:45:39,327
- Keys?
- They're in the cab.

426
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:44,638
- The truck won't make it to Fort Pastor.
- Forget it. That place is fucked.

427
00:45:44,677 --> 00:45:47,407
- Bloodbath city.
- How do you know?

428
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:50,142
We just came from there.

429
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:52,810
- Is everyone there dead?
- Dead-ish.

430
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:57,354
- Is everyone there dead?
- Yeah.

431
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:01,724
In the sense that
they all sort of fell down and then...

432
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:04,059
- I have to see.
- You won't make it.

433
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:06,361
- ...got up and...
- I'll get as far as I can.

434
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:09,027
- One foot.
- ...started eating each other.

435
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:11,936
- I'll take my chances.
- Don't be an idiot.

436
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:17,175
Please. The people here
could use your help.

437
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,910
Fuck y'all.

438
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:28,614
It's nice to see
you've all bonded through this disaster.

439
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:44,089
- Hey. You need anything?
- No, we're fine.

440
00:47:44,132 --> 00:47:46,293
He's got a bite on his hand.

441
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:56,404
She's cold.

442
00:47:56,446 --> 00:47:59,176
That's good, right?

443
00:47:59,248 --> 00:48:01,808
I don't know. It's weird.

444
00:48:01,884 --> 00:48:04,785
An infection this bad
usually comes with a fever.

445
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:10,522
That guy's arm looks pretty bad.
You should check it out.

446
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,997
All right. Stay with her for a minute.

447
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:22,466
- Let me take a look at that.
- I'm fine, really.

448
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:27,943
They don't hurt much. Tucker could use you
more than me. His ankle's cut pretty bad.

449
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:30,445
I'll just clean it up a bit.

450
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,779
You OK?

451
00:48:32,816 --> 00:48:36,081
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?

452
00:48:40,524 --> 00:48:42,822
Anal Ana, come here!

453
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:10,113
Anyone know her name?

454
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,316
Died without a name?

455
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:18,295
Damn.

456
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:20,888
You wanna use the other room?

457
00:49:25,704 --> 00:49:27,729
Holy shit!

458
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:44,652
Holy shit.

459
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,751
Holy shit.

460
00:49:53,332 --> 00:49:55,823
I think it's the bites.

461
00:49:55,868 --> 00:50:00,202
Frank said she was walking on her own
five hours ago.

462
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,504
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.

463
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,009
How do you know?

464
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:09,071
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse, she was gone. Then...

465
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,774
Yesterday I saw the same thing.

466
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:16,621
I think that's why it spread so fast.

467
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,483
All right.

468
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:26,155
So who else in the group is bitten?

469
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,327
- Frank for sure.
- And the one with the foot?

470
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:32,304
Tucker? He says no, he fell.

471
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,899
So it's Frank. Tall guy, right?

472
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:37,967
Right. So we have to quarantine him.

473
00:50:38,011 --> 00:50:39,979
Where do we do that?

474
00:50:40,013 --> 00:50:42,413
There must be a place in here.

475
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:44,940
Then what?

476
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:46,976
I don't know. But...

477
00:50:47,687 --> 00:50:50,212
It's too dangerous to keep him here.

478
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,896
What are we talking about?
Are we talking about killing him?

479
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:00,728
You'd rather wait for him to die
and then he kills us?

480
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:04,101
Yes. No. You can't kill him.
He's got a daughter!

481
00:51:04,138 --> 00:51:06,265
I'm sorry.

482
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,236
There's no other choice.

483
00:51:11,846 --> 00:51:13,837
He's right.

484
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,018
Michael, no. What if I'm wrong?

485
00:51:18,052 --> 00:51:20,418
You've seen it happen before.

486
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:26,058
Frank.

487
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:28,152
Michael's coming to shoot you.

488
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:32,530
- What?
- You're infected.

489
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,400
You're going to become one of them.

490
00:51:36,637 --> 00:51:39,231
Is this true?

491
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:41,868
Are you here to kill me?

492
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,869
- You were bitten. It's only a matter of time.
- No. No. No.

493
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:49,873
Leave my dad alone. Go away.
You can't do this.

494
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:55,148
You have to understand
that she's lost everyone.

495
00:51:56,191 --> 00:51:59,319
Her mother, her two brothers.

496
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:03,594
I'm all she's got.

497
00:52:06,768 --> 00:52:09,999
Well, Michael, what are you waiting for?

498
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:12,939
Go ahead. Kill him.

499
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:18,145
- Hey, kill Tucker, too.
- Wait a minute. I was never bit.

500
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:21,048
We can't be sure. Do it, Michael.

501
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:25,914
Are you sure it's the bite?

502
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:28,446
No.

503
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,959
She's sure.

504
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:37,857
I'm sorry.

505
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:08,093
- Hey.
- Hi.

506
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:10,532
- Are you OK?
- Mm.

507
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:12,797
Let me see your arm.

508
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:14,599
It hurts.

509
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:16,868
It's already starting to heal.

510
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:19,876
Andre, I can't have baby here.

511
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:23,710
Why not? People have had babies
for millions of years,

512
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:26,545
all on their own, no hospitals.

513
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:29,518
- Wait.
- Oh, yeah.

514
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:31,714
- It's moving.
- I felt it.

515
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:34,156
We gotta come up with a name.

516
00:53:34,192 --> 00:53:37,562
- I want Russian name.
- Don't start that. African name.

517
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:41,157
- Please?
- Come here and give me a hug.

518
00:53:47,505 --> 00:53:49,735
Sweetie.

519
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,175
I'm so proud.

520
00:53:57,115 --> 00:54:00,380
I couldn't ask for anything
more in a daughter.

521
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:12,088
I love you.

522
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,626
I love you too.

523
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:25,435
- Time to go, honey.
- No.

524
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:12,491
Terry, come on. Open the door.

525
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:17,330
- Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up. Open the door.

526
00:55:17,365 --> 00:55:19,662
I got you this job. Come on.

527
00:55:36,284 --> 00:55:38,377
You want...

528
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:42,084

529
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:46,951
single second.

530
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:16,183
Ana.

531
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,020

OK, here's a good one. Top ten ingredients
to a successful relationship.

560
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,421
I'm gonna skip to the top three.

561
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:37,868
Number three. "He listens to me."

562
00:58:37,937 --> 00:58:41,065
Number two. "He tells me he loves me."

563
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,404
And number one.

564
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:48,505
It's trust. Number one is trust.

565
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:56,151
Holy shit.

566
00:58:57,223 --> 00:58:59,691
He got him.

567
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:07,556
- So, who do we have next?
- Er...

568
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:13,163
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.

569
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:15,800
Tell him to get Burt Reynolds.

570
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,722
- My goodness.
- Man, he's good.

571
00:59:35,762 --> 00:59:38,390
It barely even looked like him.

572
00:59:38,432 --> 00:59:41,162
Oh, oh... er...

573
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:44,538
- Rosie O'Donnell. Tell him Rosie.
- Yeah, Rosie.

574
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:47,336
Nah, too easy. Give him something hard.

575
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:50,865
You guys had rough childhoods?
A little bit rocky?

576
00:59:50,944 --> 00:59:55,780
Hey, sweetheart, let me tell you something.

577
00:59:55,817 --> 01:00:00,049
You have my permission -
if I ever turn into one of those things,

578
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:02,249
blow my fucking head off.

579
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,952
Oh, yeah, you can count on that.

580
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:14,963
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay I was 13.

581
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:19,065
This guy,

582
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,108
Todd,

583
01:00:22,677 --> 01:00:24,975
he was building a deck in our backyard...

584
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:28,175
OK! Just, please, stop.

585
01:00:32,187 --> 01:00:34,519
He had the most astonishing blue eyes.

586
01:00:34,556 --> 01:00:37,116
Oh, my God! I'm in hell.

587
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:47,096
How's Luda doing?

588
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:51,163
She's fine. Hey, where's that lemon stuff?

589
01:00:51,206 --> 01:00:54,607
It's all gone. Steve likes
to put it in his booze.

590
01:00:56,378 --> 01:00:58,403
Try the vanilla stuff.

591
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,415
All right.

592
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,748
I'd like to check on her,
see how she's doing.

593
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:05,310
No, thanks. She's fine.

594
01:01:05,354 --> 01:01:08,950
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

595
01:01:08,992 --> 01:01:11,324
It's OK, hon. We understand.

596
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:19,728
Thanks.

597
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:39,451
And before that, I worked
in a stationery store.

598
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:43,516
And I drove a snowplow. Fixed copiers.

599
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,998
It's a shame this whole
end-of-the-world thing's holding you back.

600
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:54,732
OK, worst job.

601
01:01:59,276 --> 01:02:03,770
I know which job I was the worst at -
it was being a husband.

602
01:02:03,848 --> 01:02:06,749
- That's not a job.
- It sure is.

603
01:02:07,585 --> 01:02:10,611
You guys just haven't met the right girl.

604
01:02:10,654 --> 01:02:13,350
I tried it three times and...

605
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,018
I got pink slips every time.

606
01:02:16,894 --> 01:02:18,987
What were you best at?

607
01:02:24,069 --> 01:02:26,594
Being a dad.

608
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,899
I think I was best at that.

609
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,086
Calm down.

610
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,714
- Are they in?
- No. Are there generators?

611
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:53,720
Shh. OK, shh.

612
01:02:53,765 --> 01:02:57,223
Shhh... It's all right, baby.

613
01:03:13,185 --> 01:03:15,779
Baby, please. You got to be quiet, OK?

614
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:22,387
It's gonna be all right.
Our baby is on the way. It's coming.

615
01:03:24,697 --> 01:03:26,892
That's it.

616
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:32,701
It's in employee parking level 3.
They're in a pen near the parking shuttles.

617
01:03:32,738 --> 01:03:36,174
- Have fun.
- Wait a minute. You're coming too.

618
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:40,805
No, I'm not. I said I'd tell you
where the generators are, not show you.

619
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:45,545
Did you think I'd just leave you two up here?
You come with me or go back in the cell.

620
01:03:51,391 --> 01:03:53,552
All right.

621
01:03:53,594 --> 01:03:56,461
I ain't going anywhere without a gun.

622
01:03:57,731 --> 01:04:01,428
- You're not getting a gun.
- Trust.

623
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:04,266
The primary ingredient in any relationship.

624
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:10,402
Have at 'em, cowboy.

625
01:04:11,511 --> 01:04:13,979
Asshole.

626
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:18,142
Bart, get the chains.

627
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,997
- You ready to roll?
- You're coming with us?

628
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,297
No, you're coming with me.

629
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:36,462
I've done this before.

630
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:40,064
Know how to use that?

631
01:04:41,275 --> 01:04:43,971
This one's the dangerous end, right?

632
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:48,577
Now it is.

633
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,143
This is level 1. We gotta walk down to 3.

634
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:13,201
What the fuck was that?
I just saw something.

635
01:06:13,237 --> 01:06:15,501
You didn't see shit. Shut the fuck up.

636
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:29,547
Oh, shit. Here it comes.

637
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:39,653
Jesus Christ.

638
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,292
It's a fucking dog.

639
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:46,132
Come here, boy.

640
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,974
Nothing's here or it would've eaten him.

641
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:54,137
See? I told you I saw something.

642
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:57,637
- What's wrong, boy?
- There's nothing wrong.

643
01:06:57,682 --> 01:07:00,014
That dog's just fucked up.

644
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:16,957
Run!

645
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:22,305
Wait, CJ! Wait up! Wait!

646
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,574
It's locked! It's fucking locked!

647
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:35,353
Come on, let's go!

648
01:07:45,464 --> 01:07:47,261
CJ!

649
01:08:02,915 --> 01:08:05,214
I'm out!

650
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:16,228
CJ! Matches!

651
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:52,727
Breathe. You're doing good. Breathe.

652
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:55,702
You're doing good, baby.

653
01:09:25,668 --> 01:09:27,966
I'm sorry.

654
01:09:31,573 --> 01:09:33,666
I'm sorry.

655
01:10:54,425 --> 01:10:56,893
- Thanks.
- OK. That's the last.

656
01:10:56,927 --> 01:10:58,952
I'm gonna go check on Luda.

657
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:00,622
- I'll go.
- You sure?

658
01:11:00,664 --> 01:11:03,326
- Yeah. I'll take them some candles.
- OK.

659
01:11:03,367 --> 01:11:06,894
- Let me know if they need anything.
- I'll have a smoke on the way.

660
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:09,201
- See you.
- Bye.

661
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:13,807
It's coming.

662
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:20,577
I see it.

663
01:11:55,955 --> 01:11:58,651
Guys?

664
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:13,130
Oh, my God.

665
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:20,937
It's a girl.

666
01:12:26,152 --> 01:12:28,120
Oh...

667
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:37,755
You want to kill Luda?

668
01:12:40,601 --> 01:12:42,762
You want to kill my family?

669
01:13:34,989 --> 01:13:37,082
Normal Come on, Norma.

670
01:13:38,593 --> 01:13:40,584
What happened?

671
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:43,529
The son of a bitch shot me.

672
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:52,598
- Get away from her.
- Wait. Just wait.

673
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:57,341
She died of the gunshot.

674
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:00,706
She wasn't bitten.

675
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:03,613
But she'll wake up, right?

676
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:08,755
No.

677
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,692
No, if she was one of them,
she'd be up by now.

678
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:45,695
- Terry?
- Yeah.

679
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:48,493
Hold this.

680
01:14:55,772 --> 01:14:57,967
Oh, God.

681
01:15:25,002 --> 01:15:27,971
- Somebody should say something.
- Yeah.

682
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:29,836
Glen?

683
01:15:29,874 --> 01:15:32,069
No.

684
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:34,703
You worked in the church.

685
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:37,370
I played the organ.

686
01:15:37,415 --> 01:15:42,149
You must have heard the priest say
something about life and death.

687
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:45,281
It was a job. I don't believe in God.

688
01:15:46,992 --> 01:15:49,085
I don't see how anyone could.

689
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:53,126
Somebody should say something.

690
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:58,563
There's nothing to say.

691
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:01,696
I've been to a lot of funerals.

692
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:08,239
I've folded the flag and given it
to a lot of wives and fathers and kids

693
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,407
and told them how sorry I was.

694
01:16:11,516 --> 01:16:14,610
But that's not what I was really feeling.

695
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:19,284
In the back of my mind,
I was always saying, "Better them than me."

696
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:23,852
But I don't believe that now.

697
01:16:23,896 --> 01:16:27,662
Now I realize there are some things
worse than death

698
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:30,965
and one of them is sitting
here waiting to die.

699
01:16:35,108 --> 01:16:37,201
I don't want to die here.

700
01:16:43,983 --> 01:16:46,577
I saw a couple of buses in the garage.

701
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:50,146
We could reinforce them,
then get as far from here as possible.

702
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:54,286
- And then what?
- I have an idea. Um...

703
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:57,195
Why don't we swing by the marina

704
01:16:57,231 --> 01:17:02,100
and hop in my boat and take it
for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.

705
01:17:02,903 --> 01:17:07,431
Wait. There's islands in the lakes,
there's not a lot of people on them.

706
01:17:07,508 --> 01:17:09,476
I was kidding.

707
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,172
- How far is the marina?
- Oh, my God!

708
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:16,814
- You're serious?
- I think it's a damn good idea.

709
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,611
How about the rest of you?

710
01:17:20,654 --> 01:17:23,817
- Kenneth?
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

711
01:17:23,857 --> 01:17:27,224
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.

712
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:32,598
Excuse me. Not to shit on anyone's riff
but let me see if I grasp this concept.

713
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:37,604
You're saying we take the parking shuttles,
reinforce them with aluminum siding

714
01:17:37,672 --> 01:17:39,606
and then head to the gun store

715
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:44,010
where our friend Andy plays some
cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-wagon bullshit.

716
01:17:44,045 --> 01:17:48,482
Then we drive across a ruined city
through thousands of dead cannibals,

717
01:17:48,516 --> 01:17:52,782
all so we can sail off into the sunset
on this fucking asshole's boat?

718
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:56,348
And head for some island
which may not even exist?

719
01:17:57,392 --> 01:18:01,886
- Yeah.
- Pretty much, yeah.

720
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:07,563
Yeah.

721
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:11,231
OK.

722
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:14,108
I'm in.

723
01:18:17,179 --> 01:18:21,138

We have 12 of these shotgun shells,
26 of those pussy .9-mils,

735
01:19:26,951 --> 01:19:29,749
and 16 of the .357 Magnums.

736
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:31,982
Yeah? That's still not very much,

737
01:19:32,023 --> 01:19:36,858
so hopefully there won't be
too many of them at the dock.

738
01:19:36,894 --> 01:19:39,089
Nice to see you busting your ass.

739
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:42,759
Oh, that's sarcasm. That is awesome.

740
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,361
You know, I would love to help but, er,

741
01:19:46,437 --> 01:19:49,565
a captain never works alongside his men.

742
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,906
You guys have a good 'un.

743
01:19:53,945 --> 01:19:56,778
What a total dick.

744
01:19:56,814 --> 01:19:59,476
Guys, where did Chips go?

745
01:19:59,517 --> 01:20:03,818
- Chips?
- I can't find him. Chips? Come on, Chips!

746
01:20:03,855 --> 01:20:07,416
- "Come on, Chips!"
- Where'd you go, honey?

747
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:14,258
There you are. There's my boy.

748
01:20:14,299 --> 01:20:17,200
Don't you ever leave me again, OK?
Ever, ever.

749
01:20:44,764 --> 01:20:47,358
Hey. Kenneth wants a meeting upstairs.

750
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,392
Come in here first. I want you to see this.

751
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:59,034
When those things are on
the side of the bus, this'll get them off.

752
01:21:00,046 --> 01:21:02,037
Cool, huh?

753
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,083
Wow.

754
01:21:05,118 --> 01:21:09,350
That might be the most romantic thing
anyone's ever shown me.

755
01:21:13,126 --> 01:21:15,094
I'm trying here.

756
01:21:16,429 --> 01:21:18,489
Yeah, I know.

757
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,906
It's not just about him starving.

758
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:40,682
If we pick him up and he doesn't have
his strength, we'll be carrying him.

759
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:43,713
She's right. He's a hell of a shot.
We need him.

760
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:47,318
- I'm not saying we don't.
- There's no point in arguing.

761
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:50,194
We need to get some food over there.

762
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:54,894
I know. We draw straws and the loser runs
across the lot with a ham sandwich.

763
01:21:54,935 --> 01:21:58,531
- Could you be a bigger prick?
- Yes, but that's irrelevant.

764
01:21:58,606 --> 01:22:00,938
My question is, what's your plan?

765
01:22:00,975 --> 01:22:03,569
Come on!

766
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:07,974
I got it.

767
01:22:08,049 --> 01:22:10,449
- Shut up!
- ...more ammunition.

768
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,320
I have an idea.

769
01:22:14,355 --> 01:22:18,485
- It's hurting him! It's not safe!
- They're not interested in him.

770
01:22:18,526 --> 01:22:22,587
They want us, OK? Chips is gonna be fine.

771
01:22:31,441 --> 01:22:35,707
See? Look, they're not even
paying attention to him.

772
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,545
- The walkie's in the bag?
- Yeah.

773
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,945
Let me see. Let me see!

774
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,621
There he is.

775
01:22:53,662 --> 01:22:55,823
Good boy. Good boy, Chips.

776
01:22:58,134 --> 01:23:01,126
- OK, he's there, he's in.
- Give me those.

777
01:23:03,372 --> 01:23:04,964
Oh, man.

778
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,099
- What? What?
- No.

779
01:23:07,176 --> 01:23:10,145
No. Oh, man. They got him. They got him!

780
01:23:18,588 --> 01:23:22,149
I'll try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?

781
01:23:23,527 --> 01:23:25,586
Andy, can you hear me?

782
01:23:26,696 --> 01:23:29,221
Andy?

783
01:23:29,266 --> 01:23:32,793
'Can you hear me? Hello?
This thing working?

784
01:23:32,836 --> 01:23:36,067
'I'm dinged up pretty bad
but I think I'll be OK.'

785
01:23:37,207 --> 01:23:40,665
- Where are you hurt?
- 'Goddamn, those bastards bite hard.

786
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,411
'I just have to stop the bleeding.
It's really going.'

787
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:50,819
'Easy, boy. Easy. Is this Ken?

788
01:23:50,855 --> 01:23:52,948
'Is that you, man?'

789
01:23:54,392 --> 01:23:58,226
- Yeah, it's me, brother.
- 'Hey, man, good to hear your voice.

790
01:23:58,262 --> 01:24:00,696
'I guess we'll meet up-close pretty soon.

791
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,564
'Shit, hang on.

792
01:24:03,601 --> 01:24:06,069
'Ah, Jesus. He got me good.'

793
01:24:06,103 --> 01:24:09,504
You just hang in there.
You got the food, right?

794
01:24:09,574 --> 01:24:11,633
- 'Yeah.'
- Do we tell him?

795
01:24:11,676 --> 01:24:15,168
'Hey, this dog got a name?'

796
01:24:17,515 --> 01:24:20,882
See, Nicole, Chips... Nicole?

797
01:24:20,918 --> 01:24:24,183
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, my God, it's Nicole!

798
01:24:29,094 --> 01:24:31,187
Shit.

799
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:41,401
That idiot's going after the fucking dog.

800
01:24:44,443 --> 01:24:46,536
She made it! She's in!

801
01:24:48,847 --> 01:24:52,977
'Guys, I found Chips!
I got him. He's OK!'

802
01:24:53,018 --> 01:24:55,077
Nicole, how's Andy looking?

803
01:24:56,188 --> 01:25:00,716
'I don't know. There's a lot of blood in here.
There's blood everywhere.'

804
01:25:00,759 --> 01:25:02,920
Wait, I see him. He's on the roof.

805
01:25:04,129 --> 01:25:07,293
- He's writing something.
- What's it say?

806
01:25:09,002 --> 01:25:10,833
'Guys?'

807
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,532
- Tell her to get out!
- What's wrong?

808
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:17,373
- Nicole, how's the truck?
- 'I'm not going back out there.'

809
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:20,072
"Chips, be quiet!'

810
01:25:20,146 --> 01:25:21,977
Tell her to get the hell out!

811
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:26,917
- You need to hide. Can you do that?
- 'What do you mean? What's going on?'

812
01:25:26,953 --> 01:25:29,421
- Nicole?
- 'Here's Andy.

813
01:25:29,455 --> 01:25:31,480
- 'Oh, my God!'
- Tell her to get out!

814
01:25:31,524 --> 01:25:33,685
Nicole, listen to me.

815
01:25:33,726 --> 01:25:37,560
'I'm in a closet
but he's outside trying to get...'

816
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:39,724
Nicole? Nicole?

817
01:25:39,766 --> 01:25:43,965
'Help me. Please, you have to help me!
I'm gonna die!'

818
01:25:49,143 --> 01:25:52,010
We need to do something. Now.

819
01:25:58,919 --> 01:26:01,786
Tucker, when we come back
we may have company.

820
01:26:01,822 --> 01:26:04,586
Stay here and make sure
this door stays open.

821
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:07,594
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Why does he stay here

822
01:26:07,628 --> 01:26:12,327
while I go on the suicide mission
to rescue Terry's already dead girlfriend?

823
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:14,459
- Fuck you.
- We don't know that.

824
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:18,665
Either way, we need the guns
to get out of this parking lot.

825
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:22,768
- Michael, it's OK. Let him stay.
- Yeah.

826
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,974
- Steve, don't fuck this up.
- Yeah. Totally.

827
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:15,521
- All right. That's it.
- Are you sure?

828
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,759
I'd say we're at the end of the line.

829
01:28:06,249 --> 01:28:08,274
Go! Go!

830
01:28:11,588 --> 01:28:15,218
- Through here!
- Hurry up!

831
01:28:34,879 --> 01:28:37,905
Hurry up, hurry.

832
01:28:52,498 --> 01:28:56,662
.- 357... 357. What do you need?
- .38... 38.

833
01:28:56,702 --> 01:28:59,068
- Here.
- Damn it.

834
01:28:59,104 --> 01:29:01,197
Hurry up.

835
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,440
All right.

836
01:29:10,149 --> 01:29:12,174
Oh, shit.

837
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:19,017
Nicole?

838
01:29:46,886 --> 01:29:50,083
Andy.

839
01:29:50,156 --> 01:29:52,386
I'm sorry, brother.

840
01:29:58,598 --> 01:30:01,965
- Nicole, are you in there?
- I'm here, I'm here!

841
01:30:04,904 --> 01:30:07,635
Get as much ammo as you can.

842
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:13,976
- You got a plan?
- Uh-uh. You?

843
01:30:15,115 --> 01:30:17,208
How about a barbecue?

844
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,961
How do we know if he hits it?

845
01:31:05,767 --> 01:31:08,258
CJ! Over here, hurry up!

846
01:31:08,303 --> 01:31:10,362
Over here!

847
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:13,673
Go! Get down! Look out!

848
01:31:17,746 --> 01:31:20,340
Come on, Tucker!

849
01:31:20,382 --> 01:31:23,284
Shit!

850
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:26,720
- Ah, my leg!
- I got you, Tucker.

851
01:31:28,224 --> 01:31:31,660
Go! Go!

852
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:33,025
Shit!

853
01:31:35,931 --> 01:31:38,126
Go!

854
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:41,396
Go!

855
01:32:04,361 --> 01:32:07,330
Shoot me! Shoot me!

856
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,733
Hurry! Come on!

857
01:32:12,769 --> 01:32:15,101
Hurry, hurry!

858
01:32:16,473 --> 01:32:18,600
Goddamn Steve Markus!

859
01:32:20,777 --> 01:32:23,211
- Steve, come on!
- Open up!

860
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:27,239
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Steve!

861
01:32:27,284 --> 01:32:30,219
- I'll fucking kill him!
- Open the door.

862
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:33,484
Steve!

863
01:32:43,768 --> 01:32:45,463
Let's go.

864
01:32:51,809 --> 01:32:54,505
Goddammit!

865
01:32:55,446 --> 01:32:57,573
Move!

866
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:06,784
- Go!
- Move it, guys, move it!

867
01:33:06,858 --> 01:33:09,383
- Where are you going?
- Just go right now!

868
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:11,018
Go! Go!

869
01:33:11,095 --> 01:33:13,427
- They're right behind us!
- Go!

870
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:19,570
Come on, move! They're right behind us!

871
01:33:22,007 --> 01:33:23,599
Get in!

872
01:33:23,642 --> 01:33:26,042
Close the door!

873
01:33:36,855 --> 01:33:38,948
I like this song.

874
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:47,926
- Everybody in!
- What the hell happened to you guys?

875
01:33:47,966 --> 01:33:51,800
- Prick.
- I'll deal with you later, motherfucker!

876
01:33:51,837 --> 01:33:55,467
- Wait a minute! Nicole!
- Get in!

877
01:33:57,677 --> 01:34:00,339
I'll take the gun. OK.

878
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:03,574
OK, let's get out of here!

879
01:34:22,569 --> 01:34:24,196
Hold on!

880
01:34:37,818 --> 01:34:39,809
Oh, Christ!

881
01:34:45,493 --> 01:34:47,893
CJ, now! Go!

882
01:35:04,411 --> 01:35:07,972
They're trying to turn us over!
Hit 'em with the saw!

883
01:35:33,742 --> 01:35:35,937
Give me a shotgun!

884
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:06,371
Holy shit.

885
01:36:44,681 --> 01:36:47,548
There's still one hanging on.

886
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:50,553
- Which fucking side?
- Right side!

887
01:36:53,056 --> 01:36:56,184
- I got him.
- You gotta drive faster, man.

888
01:36:57,628 --> 01:37:00,096
Hard left here!

889
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:20,509
Whoa, stop! Stop, guys.

890
01:37:20,551 --> 01:37:22,610
- What?
- We lost them.

891
01:37:22,654 --> 01:37:24,849
Back it up!

892
01:37:30,395 --> 01:37:32,056
Kenneth, are you there?

893
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,194
'Kenneth, are you there?

894
01:37:46,478 --> 01:37:48,537
'Kenneth, are you OK?'

895
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:12,232
What the fuck?

896
01:38:17,643 --> 01:38:21,444
- What are you doing?
- Fucking nursery school.

897
01:38:25,652 --> 01:38:27,483
CJ!

898
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:34,283
Ana, no! Everyone's dead.

899
01:38:34,327 --> 01:38:37,421
- Steve took off.
- What?

900
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:40,424
Let's go! Come on!

901
01:38:45,004 --> 01:38:46,528
Steve!

902
01:38:46,606 --> 01:38:48,836
I got him.

903
01:38:52,378 --> 01:38:53,743
Damn.

904
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:56,840
Look out!

905
01:38:57,451 --> 01:38:59,078
Come on, come on!

906
01:39:01,322 --> 01:39:03,552
Go, go, go!

907
01:39:03,591 --> 01:39:07,584
- Open the door! Hurry up!
- Come on!

908
01:39:08,629 --> 01:39:10,790
Guys, get in!

909
01:39:17,638 --> 01:39:19,663
Let's go.

910
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:21,868
Where's Ana? Anal

911
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:26,008
Anal

912
01:39:27,515 --> 01:39:29,506
Get in.

913
01:39:40,862 --> 01:39:43,660
What the hell were you doing?

914
01:40:20,736 --> 01:40:22,727
Hold on!

915
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:54,967
Come on, boy.

916
01:40:56,506 --> 01:41:00,272
Kenneth. Here. Get out
on the end of the dock.

917
01:41:00,944 --> 01:41:03,504
- CJ, come on.
- Do it! I'll catch up.

918
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:09,641
- There it is!
- Terry, get the bowline!

919
01:41:10,954 --> 01:41:13,787
Shit.

920
01:41:16,693 --> 01:41:18,524
CJ!

921
01:41:20,564 --> 01:41:22,759
Damn! Fuck!

922
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,394
Come on!

923
01:41:33,411 --> 01:41:35,641
Come on!

924
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,877
Bitch! Shit.

925
01:41:48,226 --> 01:41:50,194
Come on.

926
01:41:54,766 --> 01:41:58,031
I'll blow every fucking thing up.

927
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:30,200
OK, let's go, let's go.

928
01:42:30,235 --> 01:42:32,863
- I can't go.
- What?

929
01:42:34,506 --> 01:42:38,966
- Downtown when they jumped on us.
- Oh, no, Michael. No.

930
01:42:39,044 --> 01:42:42,980
- I have to stay here.
- You can't. No, you...

931
01:42:43,048 --> 01:42:45,813
- I'm sorry, Ana.
- I can help you.

932
01:42:45,852 --> 01:42:49,413
No, you can't. You can help them.

933
01:42:50,223 --> 01:42:52,555
Stay on the boat.

934
01:42:57,097 --> 01:42:59,031
I can help you.

935
01:42:59,065 --> 01:43:02,159
It's OK. It's gonna be all right.

936
01:43:02,202 --> 01:43:04,329
No.

937
01:43:06,006 --> 01:43:09,908
- It won't.
- Hey.

938
01:43:09,943 --> 01:43:12,605
It will.

939
01:43:26,827 --> 01:43:29,125
You sure you wanna do this?

940
01:43:29,163 --> 01:43:32,826
Yeah. I think I'll just stay here a while.

941
01:43:32,867 --> 01:43:35,062
Enjoy the sunrise.
