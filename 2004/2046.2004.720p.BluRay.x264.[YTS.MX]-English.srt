1
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,242
<i>In the year 2046,
a vast rail network spans the globe.</i>

2
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,728
<i>A mysterious train leaves for 2046
every once in a while.</i>

3
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,407
<i>Every passenger going to 2046
has the same intention.</i>

4
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,047
<i>They want to recapture
lost memories.</i>

5
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,846
<i>Because nothing ever changes
in 2046.</i>

6
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,009
<i>Nobody really knows
if that's true</i>

7
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,249
<i>because nobody's ever come back,</i>

8
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,521
<i>except me.</i>

9
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,207
998.

10
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,891
997.

11
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,243
<i>If someone wants to leave 2046,</i>

12
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,808
<i>how long will it take?</i>

13
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,121
<i>Some people get away fairly easily,</i>

14
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,248
<i>others find that 
it takes them much longer.</i>

15
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,006
<i>I forget how long
I've been on this train.</i>

16
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,687
<i>I'm starting to feel very lonely.</i>

17
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,691
As I recall,
many have gone to 2046.

18
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,611
You're the first to come back.

19
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,727
May I ask why you left 2046?

20
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,204
<i>Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046,</i>

21
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,202
<i>I gave them some vague answer.</i>

22
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
<i>Before,</i>

23
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,724
<i>when people had secrets
they didn't want to share,</i>

24
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,843
<i>they'd climb a mountain,</i>

25
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,125
<i>find a tree
and carve a hole in it,</i>

26
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,211
<i>and whisper the secret
into the hole.</i>

27
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,367
<i>Then cover it over with mud.</i>

28
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,201
<i>That way, nobody else
would ever discover it.</i>

29
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,567
<i>I once fell in love with someone.</i>

30
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,561
After a while, she wasn't there.

31
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,248
<i>I went to 2046.</i>

32
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,046
<i>I thought she might be waiting
for me there.</i>

33
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,763
<i>But I couldn't find her.</i>

34
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,966
<i>I can't stop wondering
if she loved me or not.</i>

35
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,451
<i>But I never found out.</i>

36
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>Maybe her answer was
like a secret</i>

37
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,840
<i>that no-one else
would ever know.</i>

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,289
ALL MEMORIES ARE TRACES OF TEARS

39
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,967
Didn't you promise
not to come back?

40
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,885
I came to see you.

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,001
Why?

42
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,169
I have no prospects here.

43
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,250
So I'll see
how things are in Hong Kong.

44
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,530
When are you leaving?

45
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,327
The boat sails in two days.

46
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,523
Why are you telling me?

47
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,763
I thought we might go together.

48
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,607
You know nothing
about my past, do you?

49
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,846
If you'd rather not tell me,
I don't mind.

50
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,003
If you win, I'll join you.

51
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,486
<i>She found an indirect way
of rejecting me.</i>

52
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,685
<i>As I recall,</i>

53
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,201
<i>that was the very last time
we saw each other.</i>

54
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,767
<i>Right after that,
I left Singapore.</i>

55
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,967
<i>I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966.</i>

56
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,964
<i>It was the time of the riots.</i>

57
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,723
<i>I wasn't sure
how long I'd be staying,</i>

58
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,490
<i>so I took a room
in a small hotel in Wanchai.</i>

59
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,684
<i>I wrote columns for newspapers.</i>

60
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,522
<i>They paid HK$10
per thousand words.</i>

61
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,408
<i>It was pretty tough at first.</i>

62
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,724
<i>As long as
I could make ends meet,</i>

63
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,160
<i>it made no difference</i>

64
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,805
<i>what kind of stuff I wrote.</i>

65
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,329
"Diary of the Bazooka Hero."

66
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,969
"The new star at Club Luk Kwok
is Fei Fei."

67
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,367
"A knockout beauty
with amazing bazookas."

68
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,767
"A smash hit with tit-lovers!"

69
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,920
Hang on, of course I exaggerate.

70
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,691
I can't say her tits are fake,
can I?

71
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,528
<i>I soon got used
to this kind of life.</i>

72
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,808
<i>I became an expert ladies' man.</i>

73
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,963
<i>Lots of one-night-stands.</i>

74
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,369
<i>But nothing lasts
forever anyway.</i>

75
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,927
24 DECEMBER 1966

76
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,729
Is that really true?

77
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,244
Why would I lie to you?

78
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,764
You really know me?

79
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,967
Weren't you in a show
in Singapore in '64?

80
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,447
Yes.

81
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,051
You're Lulu.

82
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,570
I was then.

83
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,531
Not any more.

84
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,689
What's your name now?

85
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,444
Why should I tell you?

86
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,129
<i>On Christmas Eve 1966,</i>

87
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,888
<i>I ran into a friend
from Singapore in a nightclub.</i>

88
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,884
<i>We'd been rather close</i>

89
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,366
<i>but that night</i>

90
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,728
<i>she'd apparently forgotten me.</i>

91
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,563
Have we really met before?

92
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,609
How could you forget?

93
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,167
You said I looked
like your late boyfriend.

94
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,283
You taught me the cha-cha.

95
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,365
Go on.

96
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,527
You were always dragging me
to the casino.

97
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,729
You'd hit a losing streak.

98
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,530
You owed a fortune.

99
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,365
My friends and I paid
for your passage to Hong Kong.

100
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,001
You talked a lot
about your late boyfriend.

101
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,971
A Chinese Filipino
from a rich family.

102
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,566
You planned to marry him.

103
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,529
But he died young.

104
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,206
You said
he was the love of your life.

105
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,241
I shouldn't bring back sad memories

106
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,523
at this time of year.

107
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,127
But do you remember
that Christmas night

108
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,284
we went drinking?

109
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,410
<i>We talked a lot.</i>

110
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,004
<i>Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?</i>

111
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,570
<i>I took her back to her hotel.</i>

112
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,524
<i>She was dead to the world.</i>

113
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,323
<i>She'd had too much to drink</i>

114
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,604
<i>so I left quickly.</i>

115
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,162
<i>On my way out,
I noticed a very familiar number.</i>

116
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,484
<i>If I hadn't run into her that night,
I wouldn't have seen that number</i>

117
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,451
<i>and I wouldn't have written "2046."</i>

118
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,330
Can I help you?

119
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,005
Is Miss Lulu in?

120
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,568
Lulu? There's no Miss Lulu here.

121
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,331
There was a Mimi,
but she moved out.

122
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,042
But I was here two days ago!
Do you know where she's gone?

123
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,442
No. What do you want with her?

124
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,400
Nothing, really.

125
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,761
I have her key.
I wanted to return it.

126
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,770
You can give it to me.

127
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,007
Thanks.

128
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,923
You want to rent the room?

129
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,006
I'm just back from abroad.
I don't have my own place yet.

130
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,282
If the room's vacant,
I could take a look.

131
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,528
This is just a small hotel,

132
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,564
but our residents are all
decent people.

133
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,966
What's your line of work?

134
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,601
I write for newspapers.

135
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,281
Great! A fellow artist!

136
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,401
I haven't always done this.
I used to be an artist, too.

137
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,442
Really?

138
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,651
I took singing lessons in Harbin.

139
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,446
Back then, I was a tenor.

140
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,007
It'll be a pleasure
to have you here.

141
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,961
- When will you move in?
- As soon as possible.

142
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,088
But 2046 has to be redecorated.

143
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,805
2047 is vacant.

144
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,730
Take a look at it.

145
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,001
Never mind.

146
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,884
I'll come back when it's ready.

147
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,843
Why that particular room?

148
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,964
Maybe it's the number.

149
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,483
It has some significance for you?

150
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,966
I'm joking.

151
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,761
Tell you what.

152
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,165
Take a quick look at 2047.
If it's okay, you can move in.

153
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,161
Then switch to 2046 when it's ready.
How about it?

154
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,963
- Can I see the room?
- Of course. Please.

155
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,369
<i>Once I moved in,</i>

156
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,724
<i>I found out what had happened
the night before.</i>

157
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,764
<i>Lulu was stabbed
by a jealous boyfriend.</i>

158
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,883
<i>A drummer from the club.</i>

159
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,130
<i>She'd really liked him,</i>

160
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,531
<i>and compared him
with a bird that could never land.</i>

161
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,129
<i>For all these years,</i>

162
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,405
<i>she has been looking for
her "legless bird."</i>

163
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,288
<i>Most of her affairs ended badly,
but she didn't mind sad endings.</i>

164
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,804
<i>No matter what happened,</i>

165
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,566
<i>at least she was always
the leading lady.</i>

166
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,680
Good!

167
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,606
Sure!

168
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,722
Go!

169
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,850
Let's go!

170
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,085
Let's go!

171
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,811
I'll go with you!

172
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,245
Good, I'll go with you!

173
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Sure!

174
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,850
I understand!

175
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,360
You know what I mean?
I know... I understand.

176
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,966
I got it!

177
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,242
Can I go?

178
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,241
I can go!

179
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,286
Sure!

180
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,245
I understand!

181
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,281
Got it!

182
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,487
<i>It didn't take long
to finish redecorating 2046.</i>

183
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,049
<i>But by then
I was used to 2047.</i>

184
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,002
Sure!

185
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,967
<i>I started hearing a strange voice
through the wall.</i>

186
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,283
<i>I thought someone had moved in.</i>

187
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,009
<i>But it was the daughter
of the hotel owner, Mr. Wang.</i>

188
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,330
Please take me with you!

189
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,086
Definitely!

190
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,482
I'm definitely going!

191
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,041
Okay, let's go!

192
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,647
<i>I had no idea
what she was saying.</i>

193
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,131
<i>The bell-hop told me
it was Japanese.</i>

194
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,329
<i>It seems she had
a Japanese boyfriend.</i>

195
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,682
Tell the driver
"220 Granville Road."

196
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,844
- Ga...ran...wai...
- 220 Granville Road.

197
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,088
Turn from Humphreys Avenue,
near Kimberley Road.

198
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,691
Can you say again?

199
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,962
- Don't turn down Salisbury Road
- Slowly, please.

200
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,401
- I'll draw you a map.
- That's my pen!

201
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,170
I'll repeat it once more.

202
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,204
Turn from Humphreys Avenue,
near Kimberly Road.

203
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,482
But don't turn down Salisbury Road.

204
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,761
Understand?

205
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,844
I'll draw you a map.

206
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,691
Granville Road.

207
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,407
Turn from Humphreys Avenue,
don't turn down Salisbury Road.

208
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,321
Remember, don't turn down Salisbury Road.

209
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,407
<i>His company in Japan
had sent him to Hong Kong.</i>

210
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,164
<i>when he got here,
he checked into this hotel.</i>

211
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,689
The world is full of men!

212
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,247
Why do you have to choose a Japanese?

213
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,885
Get rid of him!

214
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,969
I will never meet him!

215
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,289
You want my blessing?

216
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,649
Not while I'm alive!

217
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,489
<i>It had been going on for ages.</i>

218
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,365
<i>Their family suffered
under the Japanese in the war,</i>

219
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,527
<i>so they had to break up.</i>

220
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,084
Can you tell me what you feel?

221
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,729
Do you like me?

222
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,762
Or not?

223
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,607
I'm scared to hear your answer.

224
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,683
But I have to ask anyway.

225
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,085
Leave with me.

226
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,447
Goodbye.

227
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,481
<i>The man finally went back
to Japan.</i>

228
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,330
<i>That's when Miss Wang
began talking to herself.</i>

229
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,931
Hey, ask your boss
to turn it down a bit!

230
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,331
Mr. Chow,
you'd better ask him yourself.

231
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,122
Mr. Chow...

232
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,130
Hasn't he left already?

233
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,890
Why is he back?

234
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,650
I will not see him!

235
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,530
If you won't give him up...

236
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,724
Get out! Go away with him!

237
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,167
<i>I assumed that Mr. Wang
played it so loud</i>

238
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,323
<i>because he loved his opera.</i>

239
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,966
<i>Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family row.</i>

240
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,010
What are you doing?

241
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,287
Come back for me
when you're a little older!

242
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,606
Wait till you grow up!

243
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,686
I like it.

244
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,241
<i>Mr. Wang thought about very little
but his two daughters.</i>

245
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,569
<i>The elder one was crazy
about her Japanese man.</i>

246
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,128
<i>The younger one was precocious.
She always came in my room for drinks.</i>

247
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,607
<i>Then she ran off with some man.</i>

248
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,806
<i>Another drummer
from a club band, I heard.</i>

249
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,450
<i>After she left, her elder sister
got into trouble too.</i>

250
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,484
Hey, have a word with your boss for me.
I'm a bit late with the rent.

251
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,603
Anyway, he has my deposit.

252
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,771
Mr. Chow, tell him yourself.
He's in a foul mood these days.

253
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,371
What's eating him?

254
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,844
First, one daughter ran away,
now the other one's in hospital.

255
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,485
Why is she in hospital?

256
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,480
He wouldn't say, he was quite strange.
Steer clear of him.

257
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,205
So, that's it?

258
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,451
Anyhow, give him my invitation.
It's my father's birthday banquet.

259
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,211
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe.

260
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,130
<i>On 22 May 1961, they imposed
a curfew in Hong Kong.</i>

261
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,169
<i>Home-made bombs caused panic.</i>

262
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,567
<i>The economy stopped dead.</i>

263
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,611
<i>I stopped going out.</i>

264
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,209
<i>Some thought I was
a reformed character.</i>

265
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,443
<i>Actually, I was writing.</i>

266
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,001
<i>A story called 2046.</i>

267
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,208
<i>All about men and women
looking for love,</i>

268
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,801
<i>risking everything
to get to a place called 2046.</i>

269
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,967
What's that?

270
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,520
Let's go to...

271
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,286
<i>I made it bizarre and erotic,</i>

272
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,005
<i>without crossing the line.</i>

273
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,051
<i>The readers liked it.</i>

274
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,288
<i>Some didn't take
to the science-fiction angle,</i>

275
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,131
<i>but all "2046" meant to me was...</i>

276
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,683
<i>the number of a hotel room.</i>

277
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,689
<i>I made up the whole thing.</i>

278
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,051
<i>But some of my own experiences
found their way into it.</i>

279
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,730
<i>People I ran into
in the normal course of things</i>

280
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,604
<i>turned up in my stories.</i>

281
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,489
<i>I felt more and more at ease
in my fictional world.</i>

282
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,083
<i>Around that time,
Mr. Wang's music got louder again.</i>

283
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,530
<i>More trouble
with his two daughters.</i>

284
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,248
<i>But also because
of the bad state of the economy.</i>

285
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,771
<i>A lot of the rooms were empty.</i>

286
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,485
Then in September,
the rioting ended.

287
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,769
<i>Life went back to normal</i>

288
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,242
<i>Soon, someone moved into 2046.</i>

289
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,367
Have you nearly finished?
It's too early in the day for that!

290
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,801
Some of us are trying to sleep!

291
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,722
Peeking?

292
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,687
The woman next door is quite a dish!
What are my chances?

293
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,521
You're off your head. A father-to-be
shouldn't have that on his mind.

294
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,405
Now she's pregnant.
My wife won't let me touch her.

295
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,489
Come on. Put in a word for me.

296
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,360
Okay.

297
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,290
How much?

298
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,284
How much have you got?

299
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,086
Only $100.

300
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,406
Wait for my call.

301
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,921
Mr. Chow!

302
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,210
Mr. Chow, a call for you!

303
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,050
Bright and early, huh?

304
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,364
She's not up yet.

305
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,249
Why come over?
I told you, it has to be arranged.

306
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,571
She's not some street walker!

307
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,168
A fellow artist like you.
Show her a little respect, will you?

308
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,681
Yes, I'll tell you right away.

309
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,289
Miss Bai, your key.

310
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,770
You're back, Miss Bai.

311
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,527
Who is it?

312
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,681
Who are you looking for?

313
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,121
Mr. Chow suggested I come by.

314
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,451
You're back, Mr. Chow.

315
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,764
Did you win on the dogs?

316
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,201
- I lost!
- I won a little.

317
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,046
Looking for me?

318
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,763
I think you know this person?

319
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,045
What are doing in that room?

320
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,811
You said you'd arrange it!
I paid you!

321
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,241
- I said that room.
- I said this one.

322
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,125
Your girl's in that room.

323
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,283
How embarrassing!
Please excuse him.

324
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,443
I told you,
the room on the left!

325
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,769
- I said I wanted that one!
- Shut up!

326
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,560
Who is it?

327
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,122
Oh, you again!

328
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,003
I just wanted
to apologize for last night.

329
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,441
Forget it.

330
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,766
Go away.

331
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,121
Ping, my editor,
was out of line.

332
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,606
But he's not really so bad.

333
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,531
Just a bit stingy.
Never pays his way.

334
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,522
Always says he's broke when the check arrives.
So I played a trick on him.

335
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,327
At my expense?
Didn't you go a bit far?

336
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,042
He only fell for it
because you're so beautiful.

337
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,965
You're quite a flirt!

338
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,009
Just stating the fact.

339
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,969
A small token of apology.

340
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,731
Please accept it.

341
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,646
I don't want it.

342
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,044
You're still cross, aren't you?

343
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,807
Please accept it.

344
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,724
- No.
- Come on.

345
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,001
- No.
- It's just a token...

346
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,964
Don't make fun of me,
I mean what I say!

347
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,646
Now, get out!

348
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,047
That's good, let it all out.

349
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,611
Slap me again if you want.

350
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,720
Think I wouldn't dare?
Come closer.

351
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,041
Bastard!

352
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,004
Don't be so petty.

353
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,611
That's enough.

354
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,523
I'm courteous enough
not to slap you again.

355
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,087
That doesn't mean
you can take advantage.

356
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,521
This time I'll give you face.

357
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,249
If there's ever a next time,
I'll be less polite.

358
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,329
It won't happen again.

359
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,443
My face is still numb.

360
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,321
Accept it.

361
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,129
They're just a token of my regard.

362
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,044
I chose them myself.

363
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,964
See if you like them.

364
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,729
If you don't,
just throw them away.

365
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,081
Good.

366
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,724
I'll leave now.

367
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,249
Calm down!

368
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,721
It's none of your business
who I dated last night!

369
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,521
Who?

370
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,571
Dabao!

371
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,767
Which Dabao?

372
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,571
The fat one or the skinny one?

373
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,161
From Shanghai or from Shandong?

374
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,007
The trouble is,
I know so many men named Dabao.

375
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,044
How should I know
which one you mean?

376
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,411
Yes, I did.

377
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,807
What are you going to do about it?

378
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,847
Fine!

379
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,123
I'll be waiting!

380
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,244
Let me just say...

381
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,485
Get out!

382
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,649
You think I can accept this?

383
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,482
Her or me.
You'd better choose!

384
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,806
Now get out!

385
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,481
24 DECEMBER 1967

386
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,243
You're back early!

387
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,131
It's Christmas!

388
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,527
Shouldn't you be having dinner
with your boyfriend?

389
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,165
What boyfriend?

390
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,605
Then let's have supper.

391
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,401
Come on.

392
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,682
You have so many girlfriends!
You need company?

393
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,520
Go out with them!

394
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,127
They all want to be with me,
but I can't choose.

395
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,881
The fairest thing is
to see none of them.

396
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,729
Come on, no point in staying
cooped up in your room.

397
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,929
I'm not in a good mood tonight.

398
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,730
I might get drunk

399
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,843
and slap you again.

400
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,486
That's okay.

401
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,406
I'm used to it.

402
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,409
If slapping me would make you happy,
take that as my Christmas present.

403
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,841
Come on.

404
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,640
Come with me.

405
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,561
Let go!

406
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,371
I didn't expect
to spend Christmas like this.

407
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,089
What did you expect?

408
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,370
We'd made plans.

409
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,761
He was taking me to Singapore.

410
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,646
He says it's warm there
at Christmas.

411
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,205
So I didn't even pack
winter clothes.

412
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,569
What I'm wearing now

413
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,010
is for summer.

414
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,489
Have you been to Singapore?

415
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,689
I worked there
for several years.

416
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,404
What kind of work?

417
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,570
On a newspaper.

418
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,650
Is it fun there?

419
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,440
It's okay.

420
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,690
Tell me more.

421
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,570
I won't be going,

422
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,483
so I'll just have to imagine it.

423
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,524
What do you want to know?

424
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,330
How's the climate?

425
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,931
Pretty warm.

426
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,371
All year round.

427
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,881
Sometimes you can't tell
what season it is.

428
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,569
The food stalls are great.

429
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,687
Ping and I ate there after work.

430
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,041
We'd eat and drink till dawn.

431
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,889
Our landlord was a funny man.

432
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,926
Short and fat,
and he always wore a skirt.

433
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,645
What the Malays call a "sarong."

434
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,489
But when you're away from home

435
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,404
it sometimes gets boring.

436
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,889
That was a dull meal.

437
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,609
Another drink somewhere else?

438
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,609
You really like to drink?

439
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,164
It makes things easy.

440
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,647
When I'm drunk,
I have no worries.

441
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,240
Won't your girlfriends
be missing you tonight?

442
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,844
They're not stuck to me.

443
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,769
They see other men too.

444
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,883
We just have fun together.

445
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,163
They still need to make a living.

446
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,604
I don't get it.

447
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,241
Where does all that "fun" get you?

448
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,242
If you find the right person,
why waste time on the others?

449
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,250
If I find the right person!

450
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,770
A man like me has nothing much
except free time.

451
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,721
That's why I need company.

452
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,849
So people are
just time-fillers to you?

453
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,610
I wouldn't say that.

454
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,569
Other people can borrow
my time too.

455
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,049
And tonight?

456
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,847
Are you borrowing me
or am I borrowing you?

457
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,451
No difference.

458
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,849
Maybe I borrowed you earlier,

459
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,849
and now you're borrowing me.

460
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,848
Ridiculous!

461
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,124
Don't get me wrong.

462
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,727
I don't intend
to take advantage of you.

463
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,930
If that was what I wanted,
I had plenty of options.

464
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,523
I just want us to be drinking pals.

465
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,891
Is that okay?

466
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,480
It's hard.

467
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,961
But I'll give it a try.

468
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,047
Okay.

469
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,811
Let's try.

470
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,040
- Where to?
- Let's drink!

471
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,406
Mr. Chow,
you seem happy tonight.

472
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,524
I certainly am,
my friends are buying me dinner.

473
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,801
This way, please.

474
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,841
Ping! Is it someone's birthday?

475
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,249
Better than that!
Chow has a new girlfriend!

476
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,602
Definitely worth celebrating!
What would you like to eat tonight?

477
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,167
Something expensive.

478
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,689
- Snake?
- Yes, snake would be good.

479
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,451
Snake isn't cheap.
Can you afford it?

480
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,127
Shut Up! Don't mind him.

481
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,209
- What'll it be, Mr. Chow?
- Snake!

482
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,970
And a lamb casserole, too.

483
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,044
And bring Hoi's whiskey.

484
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,130
Can't let this go to waste,
it's delicious.

485
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,450
Where's your girl, Chow?
It's already 2 AM. Is she coming?

486
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,804
She can't be coming.

487
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,570
I don't think she's coming.

488
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,486
It's all your fault.

489
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,091
You're why this happened.

490
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,851
Why blame me?
You brought this on yourself.

491
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,761
You said she was gentle and obedient.
Now we know the truth.

492
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,247
I said
she was sometimes obedient,

493
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,329
and sometimes gentle.

494
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,401
But she's full of surprises,
that's part of the fun.

495
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,044
- So, what next?
- Yes, what now?

496
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,283
Whatever you feel like doing.

497
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,570
And then what happened?

498
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,686
Tell me!

499
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,803
How are you going to thank me?

500
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,884
Pervert!

501
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,602
Open Up!

502
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,721
- Who is it?
- Open the door!

503
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,851
It's late.

504
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,287
You played a fine joke
on me tonight.

505
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,769
I finished work late.

506
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,850
Too late to get there.

507
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,485
So I didn't come.

508
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,081
What's this?

509
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,445
That's your fault too.

510
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,008
How could I know
you'd stand me up?

511
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,570
I thought
I'd win a few hundred.

512
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,161
Instead I lost my mustache.

513
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,930
This is all your fault.

514
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,168
You deserved it.

515
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,490
Who pushed you into the bet?

516
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,130
I'll tell you something.

517
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,209
Ping asked me not to show up.

518
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,646
Anyhow,

519
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,287
I wasn't that fond of the mustache.

520
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,929
You look younger now.

521
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,610
Don't you like it?

522
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,129
You're making fun of me!
You tricked me. I'll get you for this.

523
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,446
How will you make it up to me?

524
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,529
At least give me a kiss.

525
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,650
You bit me!

526
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,964
Come and get me!

527
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,721
You're in for it
when I catch you!

528
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,486
Don't touch me there!

529
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,689
Bastard!
You've bruised me.

530
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,443
Think you were any better?

531
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,087
Look, I'm bleeding.

532
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,009
Maybe it's because winter's coming.

533
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,407
See what happens
when I eat lamb?

534
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,851
Brings out the beast in me.

535
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,644
- What?
- Don't move.

536
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,007
- What are you doing?
- Shaving you.

537
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,811
Don't!

538
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,851
Who knows where that shaver's been.

539
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,483
It could bring me bad luck.

540
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,921
Let's go for Round Two!

541
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,811
No way.

542
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,489
Why are you dressed?

543
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,445
I'm going back to my room.
I'm exhausted.

544
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,685
This is all I have.
Aside from loose change for the bus.

545
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,844
Here's $200.

546
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,041
Please take it.

547
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,447
I don't want it.

548
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,570
I wasn't selling.

549
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,810
That's not how I meant it.

550
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,523
I want to pay for your torn dress.

551
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,206
Please take it.

552
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,686
I see.

553
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,247
You're afraid
I'll cling to you, is that it?

554
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,367
Fine.

555
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,251
I'll take $10.

556
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,043
Think of it as a discount rate.

557
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,687
If you ever want
to come over again,

558
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,530
I'll charge the same.

559
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,010
I'm going back to my room.

560
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,646
Come here.

561
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,406
Not tonight.

562
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,771
Why not?

563
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,569
Not in the mood?

564
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,607
Can't take the strain tonight.

565
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,288
Anyhow,
I'm a bit short of cash.

566
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,924
Never mind,

567
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,650
you can owe me.

568
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,249
I don't like being in debt.

569
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,524
The reception's at 6,
dinner at 8.

570
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,405
I don't mind if you can't make it,
just send your gift.

571
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,250
No more than you do.

572
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,967
You hold banquets all year round.
You've had 4 birthdays this year.

573
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,367
I'll send over some more
invitation cards later.

574
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,846
Think of people with money,

575
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,441
write in their names
and send them invitations.

576
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,207
Mr. Chow,
holding another banquet?

577
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,641
You know we have birthdays
in different calendars?

578
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,285
Another of mine's come up.

579
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,561
No doubt.

580
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,127
- Here's one for your boss
- Alright.

581
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,845
Tell him that since we're so close,

582
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,247
he can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe.

583
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,647
- Make sure he gets it.
- Okay.

584
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,124
It's late, what's so urgent?

585
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,529
Just got back from Macau.
Chow asked me to bring you a present.

586
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,721
You two went to Macau?

587
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,482
Yes, we had some days off,
so we went to the casino.

588
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,921
Oh, it's beautiful.

589
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,249
He says he found some money
in his pocket.

590
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,689
So before losing it all
at the tables,

591
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,130
he bought you a present.

592
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,041
Where is he?

593
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,403
Not back yet.
You know what he's like.

594
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,489
Extravagant
at the start of the month,

595
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,966
and broke well before the end.

596
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,162
He made several thousand

597
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,727
holding that party,
so now he's really enjoying himself.

598
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,371
Is he there alone?

599
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,043
Of course not. There's a gang of them.
He likes company.

600
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,245
Was he always like this?

601
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,010
Let's not talk about him.
Let's have a drink.

602
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,967
But I should warn you,

603
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,881
I know you like Chow a lot.
Don't waste your time on him.

604
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,281
He's not serious.

605
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,331
Guess who?

606
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,003
There's only one possibility.

607
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,289
Let me have a bite first.

608
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,726
What are you doing here?

609
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,891
What am I doing here?

610
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,931
What do you think?

611
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,967
I thought I was pretty wild.

612
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,369
But you're much wilder.

613
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,841
Pay up.

614
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,321
I haven't seen you for ages.

615
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,364
I've been busy.

616
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,046
Liar.

617
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,530
Tell me the truth.

618
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,360
I am.

619
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,367
Who was that woman
the other day?

620
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,691
What woman?

621
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,931
Don't pretend.

622
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,651
I saw her leaving your room.

623
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,731
Who is she?

624
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,281
- A friend.
- A friend?

625
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,567
What was she doing
in your room?

626
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,609
Don't be nosy, alright?

627
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,004
Go back to your room.
I have work to do.

628
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,801
I won't!

629
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,809
I'm sleeping here tonight.

630
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,644
- An overnight stay is expensive.
- No problem.

631
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,009
Name your price.

632
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,282
I'd pay anything to be with you.
Every day.

633
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,163
Retail is fine.
Wholesale is out of the question.

634
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,362
Why?

635
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,401
I just don't like it.

636
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,809
Could you make an exception for me?

637
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,362
No.

638
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,687
You treat all women like this?

639
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,086
Except one.

640
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,441
Who?

641
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,243
My mother.

642
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,091
I'm serious.

643
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,207
I don't mind
you having other women.

644
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,367
But I won't be treated
the same as them.

645
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,487
I don't care
if you love me or not.

646
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,163
I'll love you anyway.

647
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,166
Since we got together,

648
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,283
I haven't brought other men back.

649
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,568
I hoped you'd think the same way.

650
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,091
Will you promise me that?

651
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,367
No.

652
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,241
I see.

653
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,924
Then we're through.

654
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,722
I'll never bother you.
And I never want you in my room again.

655
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,330
Here, $10.

656
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,200
Tonight, I'm paying.

657
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,126
Thank you.

658
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,165
If you're ever in the mood,
feel free to come over.

659
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,169
I'll charge you the same.

660
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,490
Having fun?

661
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,964
What do you care?

662
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,010
You were rather loud last night.

663
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,170
I meant to be.

664
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,924
You bring back women,
why shouldn't I have men?

665
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,047
I want to see
if you really don't mind.

666
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,923
I won't go,
why don't you come here instead?

667
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,844
Forget it! Don't come!

668
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,327
<i>After Bai Ling moved out,
she started dating Dabao.</i>

669
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,843
<i>And I saw other women too.</i>

670
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,045
<i>If our paths ever crossed,
we'd pretend not to see each other.</i>

671
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,443
<i>Rather pathetic, I know.</i>

672
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,889
<i>But it was better
for us to end it this way.</i>

673
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,329
<i>I've never seen her since.
But sometimes she pops up</i>

674
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,760
<i>in my stories.</i>

675
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,168
Your change, please check it.

676
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,881
Thank you.

677
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,120
Are you going out later?

678
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,007
Why?

679
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,411
Could you post this letter for me?

680
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,242
Sure.

681
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,600
<i>Then Miss Wang came back.
I knew from the familiar sound through the wall.</i>

682
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,604
Please take me with you!

683
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,847
Good!

684
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,366
What are you doing?

685
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,246
Wasn't I clear?
Don't contact that Japanese man!

686
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,365
Why are you writing to him in secret?
Aren't you ashamed?

687
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,809
Return his letter!

688
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,401
No?

689
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,730
What are you reading?

690
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,164
A martial-arts novel.

691
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,760
You like them?

692
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,482
If your friend wants to send you
more letters,

693
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,569
and you don't want your dad to know,

694
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,242
tell him to send them to my room.

695
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,529
I'll pass them on to you.

696
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,520
<i>She looked happier</i>

697
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,607
<i>when she came back this time.
We talked more often.</i>

698
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,530
Mr. Chow,
another letter for you.

699
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,041
Another!

700
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,286
Those Japanese girls
get so carried away!

701
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,886
<i>"Let's see each other again.</i>

702
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,885
<i>Then, if you still think
we shouldn't be together,</i>

703
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,169
<i>tell me so, frankly.</i>

704
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,249
<i>That day, six years ago,</i>

705
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,524
<i>a rainbow appeared in my heart.</i>

706
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,722
<i>It's still there.</i>

707
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,610
<i>Like a flame burning inside me.</i>

708
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,447
<i>But what are your real feelings for me?</i>

709
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,044
<i>Are they like a rainbow
after the rain?</i>

710
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,649
<i>Or did that rainbow</i>

711
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,602
<i>fade away long ago?</i>

712
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,723
<i>I'm waiting for your answer."</i>

713
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,765
Why do you write all that stuff
about sex?

714
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,491
So I won't starve!

715
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,491
Don't you worry
about your reputation?

716
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,931
Maybe I'm not such a nice guy.

717
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,924
- Why not try writing something else?
- Who'd read it?

718
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,530
How about a martial-arts novel?
People love them.

719
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,170
That's too hard.

720
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,644
I tried once,
co-writing it with someone.

721
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,807
We locked ourselves away
for months.

722
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,210
Just got sore heads.

723
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,640
Those were good times.

724
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,450
I like writing too.

725
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,081
It's hard to make a living
by writing.

726
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,931
I just do it for fun.

727
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,961
I'll show you some of my stuff.

728
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,407
Here you are, read this first.

729
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,567
Wow, you're prolific!

730
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,363
When you've read it, tell me what you think.
And don't forget to return it.

731
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,806
Sure!

732
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,570
Have you read my story yet?

733
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,841
I have.

734
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,770
What did you think?

735
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,641
I think you should never write
another word.

736
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,166
Why not?

737
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,485
You're so good.
You could put me out of work.

738
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,643
"The Spider Sage thrusts out
his fist.

739
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,365
Two chopsticks take off
like rockets.

740
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,245
They land with explosive force.

741
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,329
The mountain splits apart."

742
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,761
Slow down, I can't keep up.

743
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,169
Come on, they're waiting for it.

744
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,486
Alright, alright.

745
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,166
Caught up?

746
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,846
Go on.

747
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,370
Where was I?

748
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,164
"The mountain splits apart."

749
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,249
Right.
"The mountain splits apart,

750
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,729
smashing Iron Abacus
to the ground."

751
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,969
Iron Abacus?
Isn't he dead?

752
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,326
Is he?

753
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,241
Then make it Iron Head.

754
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,763
Where did Iron Head
come from all of a sudden?

755
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,690
Hey, anything goes

756
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,484
in martial-arts novels.

757
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,366
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll finish it for you.

758
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,562
Okay.

759
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,443
<i>It felt like having an assistant.</i>

760
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,290
<i>When I was late with my copy,
I asked her to ghost it for me.</i>

761
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,044
<i>She was just a girl,</i>

762
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,164
<i>but she could write
as raunchily as the best of us.</i>

763
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,403
<i>We got along very well.</i>

764
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,604
<i>That was my happiest summer ever.</i>

765
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,730
<i>But it didn't last.</i>

766
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,727
<i>I encouraged her
to face up to her father,</i>

767
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,930
<i>but she didn't dare.</i>

768
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,723
<i>She wanted to pay her own way,</i>

769
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,011
<i>so I got her job
in the cloakroom at a club.</i>

770
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,282
Thanks.

771
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,884
<i>She told her father</i>

772
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,289
<i>she was going out with me.</i>

773
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,767
<i>Sometimes I found an excuse
to pick her up after work.</i>

774
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,440
You're here late.

775
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,880
If you're ready to go,

776
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,291
I have a taxi waiting.
I can give you a lift back.

777
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,001
No, thanks.

778
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,851
Then I won't wait.

779
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,764
<i>Feelings can creep up on you
unawares.</i>

780
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,169
<i>I knew that, but did she?</i>

781
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:09,451
<i>She was always asking if there was
anything at all that never changed.</i>

782
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,402
<i>I could see what was on her mind.</i>

783
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,768
<i>I promised to write a story for her,
based on my observation.</i>

784
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,327
<i>Something to show her
what her boyfriend was thinking.</i>

785
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,086
<i>As a joke,</i>

786
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,287
<i>we thought of calling it "2047."</i>

787
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,049
<i>But maybe I was being too oblique.</i>

788
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,047
<i>I'd begun to feel that it wasn't
about her boyfriend at all.</i>

789
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,085
<i>Rather it was more about me.</i>

790
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,565
<i>So I began imagining myself
as a Japanese man,</i>

791
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,287
<i>on a train for 2046,</i>

792
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,727
<i>falling for an android
with delayed reaction.</i>

793
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,928
<i>If someone wants to leave 2046,
how long will it take?</i>

794
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,724
<i>No one can say.</i>

795
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,367
<i>Some people get away
fairly easily.</i>

796
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,408
<i>Others find that
it takes them much longer.</i>

797
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,891
<i>It takes great strength.</i>

798
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,283
<i>And it can hurt terribly.</i>

799
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,484
<i>I forget how long I've been on this train.
I start to feel very lonely.</i>

800
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,843
It's rather boring at first.
But slowly you get used to it.

801
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,849
We have a range of cabin attendants.

802
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,845
They can satisfy your every need.

803
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,683
They will serve you devotedly,

804
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,086
like an intimate friend.

805
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,848
But you must never

806
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,929
fall in love with them.

807
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,009
Who'd ever fall for an android?

808
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,446
Who can say?

809
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,122
Events can creep up on you
without you ever noticing.

810
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,561
It can happen to anyone.

811
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,531
<i>Paragraph 201
in the Passengers' Guide</i>

812
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,765
<i>warns that Area 1224-1225</i>

813
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,849
<i>is especially cold.</i>

814
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,281
<i>The train heating
won't be strong enough.</i>

815
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,444
<i>Passengers are advised
to hug each other to keep warm.</i>

816
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,609
<i>Since I'm the only passenger,</i>

817
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,087
<i>I hug my android cabin attendant.</i>

818
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,723
<i>I wonder if it's her mechanism
or just my imagination,</i>

819
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,091
<i>but I sense some responsive warmth
in her artificial body.</i>

820
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,441
Why do you want to leave 2046?

821
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,845
Do you know

822
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,842
what people did in the old days

823
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,929
when they had secrets
they didn't want to share?

824
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,649
They'd climb a mountain,

825
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,930
find a tree,

826
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,129
carve a hole in it,

827
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,611
whisper the secret into the hole,

828
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,003
and cover it up with mud.

829
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,605
That way,

830
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:41,284
nobody else would ever learn
the secret.

831
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,529
I'll be your tree.

832
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,123
Tell me,
and nobody else will ever know.

833
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,406
I always...

834
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,001
I always...

835
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,126
I always...

836
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,847
Very funny. I always...

837
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,526
I always...

838
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,205
<i>Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046,</i>

839
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,243
<i>I gave them some vague answer.</i>

840
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,731
I always...

841
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,369
<i>I once fell in love with someone.</i>

842
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,000
<i>I couldn't stop wondering</i>

843
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,770
<i>whether she loved me or not.</i>

844
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,361
<i>I found an android which looked
just like her.</i>

845
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,250
<i>I thought the android might
give me the answer.</i>

846
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,164
10 HOURS LATER

847
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,481
I have a secret to tell you.

848
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,089
Leave with me.

849
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,843
I have a secret to tell you.

850
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,050
Leave with me.

851
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,089
<i>I kept on asking.</i>

852
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,489
But she never answered.

853
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,687
<i>I began dreaming up excuses
for her silence.</i>

854
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,890
Do you know the Buddhist canon?

855
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,323
"The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings"?

856
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,724
The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings.

857
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,883
It's all about the gods

858
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,121
and how they go
through this process too.

859
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,687
Our cabin attendants
are superbly designed.

860
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,687
But there's one problem.

861
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,371
When they've served
on so many long journeys,

862
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,881
fatigue begins to set in.

863
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,491
For example,

864
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:07,645
they might want to laugh,
but the smile would be slow to come.

865
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,524
They might want to cry,

866
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,520
but the tear wouldn't well up
till next day.

867
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,726
This one is failing fast.

868
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,086
I think you'd better give up.

869
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,529
<i>I grew desperate.</i>

870
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,409
<i>I felt like giving up.</i>

871
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,568
<i>But I was soon trying again.</i>

872
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,451
I have a secret to tell you.

873
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,609
Will you leave with me?

874
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,489
I have a secret

875
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,966
to tell you.

876
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,889
Will you leave with me?

877
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,290
Do you know what people did
in the old days

878
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,371
when they had secrets?

879
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,404
They'd climb a mountain,
find a tree,

880
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,443
carve a hole in it...

881
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,770
990...

882
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,687
991...

883
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,121
992...

884
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,047
993...

885
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,447
994...

886
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,010
995...

887
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,931
<i>I slowly began to doubt myself.</i>

888
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,044
<i>Maybe the reason she didn't answer</i>

889
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,207
<i>was not that her reactions were delayed,</i>

890
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,811
<i>but simply that she didn't love me.</i>

891
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,963
<i>So at last I got it.</i>

892
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,529
<i>It's entirely beyond my control.</i>

893
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,283
<i>The only thing left for me</i>

894
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,044
<i>was to give up.</i>

895
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,242
24 DECEMBER 1968

896
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,207
Why are you inviting me
to Christmas dinner?

897
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,085
You know how much I'll lose in tips
by not working?

898
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,086
Wouldn't it be awful
to be alone tonight?

899
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,570
I need company.

900
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,731
That means me?

901
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,921
Your boyfriend hasn't written
in a while.

902
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,770
I told him not to.

903
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,449
Anyway, it's hopeless.

904
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,809
No point waiting for me.

905
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,369
Why is it hopeless?
Go and look for him.

906
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,407
If you don't,
it really will be hopeless.

907
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,887
My dad will never give his consent.

908
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,010
If you were him,

909
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,889
what would you be doing tonight?

910
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,490
Why don't you ask him?

911
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,609
Have you got his phone number?

912
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,724
I can't hear you!

913
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,129
Can you speak louder?

914
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,211
I'm already shouting!

915
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:26,370
<i>I felt like Santa Claus
that night.</i>

916
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,641
Not in Cantonese!

917
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,729
<i>I took her
to the newspaper office</i>

918
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,727
<i>and let her make a long distance call
to her boyfriend.</i>

919
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,650
<i>I was happy</i>

920
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,004
<i>to see her so happy.</i>

921
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,447
<i>In fact, zone 1224-1225</i>

922
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:44,004
<i>meant Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day.</i>

923
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:49,046
<i>On the night before Christmas
many people need more warmth than usual.</i>

924
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:53,125
<i>I didn't get that.</i>

925
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,049
<i>Maybe that was for the best.</i>

926
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,367
10 HOURS LATER

927
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,490
<i>I realized</i>

928
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,283
<i>the reason the android didn't answer</i>

929
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,006
<i>had nothing to do
with her mechanism wearing out,</i>

930
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,844
<i>nor that she didn't like him.</i>

931
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,811
<i>More likely</i>

932
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,209
<i>she already loved someone else.</i>

933
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,006
<i>Soon after that,
she went to Japan.</i>

934
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,285
<i>I gave her a copy
of my story "2047."</i>

935
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,169
<i>I hope she read it.</i>

936
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:21,326
100 HOURS LATER

937
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,446
1,000 HOURS LATER

938
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,729
<i>Love is all a matter of timing.</i>

939
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,488
<i>It's no good meeting
the right person</i>

940
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,849
<i>too soon or too late.</i>

941
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,645
<i>If I'd lived
in another time or place,</i>

942
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,691
<i>my story might have had
a very different ending.</i>

943
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,766
I have to tell you.

944
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,482
Yes?

945
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,965
I'll be away for a couple of days.
Pay my daughter this month's rent.

946
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,481
She's back?

947
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,971
Not Jingwen?
I mean pay my younger girl, Jiewen.

948
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,126
So your worries are over!
Going on holiday?

949
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,766
No, I have to go to Japan.

950
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,687
But you hate Japanese!
Why go to Japan?

951
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,368
Jingwen is getting married.

952
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,086
Congratulations.

953
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,923
I wasn't sure
whether to go or not.

954
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,480
Now I've decided.

955
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,883
I just want her to be happy.

956
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,801
Can you help me choose a present?

957
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,406
No need for that.

958
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,807
She wanted me to ask you something.

959
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,082
What is it?

960
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,762
She read your story "2047."
She likes it a lot.

961
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,691
But she finds the ending too sad.

962
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,247
She wonders if you can change it?

963
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,571
I'll see what I can do.

964
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,081
AN HOUR LATER

965
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,361
10 HOURS LATER

966
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,801
100 HOURS LATER

967
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,246
Taxi!

968
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,160
<i>I also like the story
to have a happy ending.</i>

969
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,728
<i>But I don't know how to write it.</i>

970
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,648
<i>Some years back
I had a happy ending in my grasp,</i>

971
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,685
<i>but I let it slip away.</i>

972
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,680
Don't turn your back on me!

973
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,601
Has he been here?

974
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,166
<i>While I was depressed, I ran into Lulu again.
She hadn't changed.</i>

975
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,964
<i>Still intensively jealous.</i>

976
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,209
You think he's yours?
I thought you knew him well!

977
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:01,689
We've just been amusing ourselves.
So control yourself, Missy!

978
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,287
<i>Watching her taught me something.</i>

979
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,969
<i>When you don't take "no"
for an answer</i>

980
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,049
<i>there is still a chance
you'll get what you want.</i>

981
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:57,601
18 MONTHS LATER

982
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,123
Hello, is Mr. Chow there?

983
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,000
I know I have no right to ask,

984
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,764
but they say I need a guarantor.

985
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:25,850
The man who recruits girls
for the nightclub

986
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,280
says he knows you.

987
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,564
Can you talk to him for me?

988
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,641
No problem.

989
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,450
I know the man you mean.

990
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,529
I'll see him in a day or two.

991
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,769
Why did you choose Singapore?

992
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,447
I don't want to stay here
any longer.

993
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,684
I've been thinking about it
for some time.

994
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,930
I want to take a look
at the place.

995
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,010
Don't drink too much.

996
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,370
You don't look well.

997
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,684
Don't worry, it won't kill me.

998
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,571
You know what?

999
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,726
I came by here at Christmas.

1000
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,449
I thought I might run into you.

1001
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,363
Why didn't you call me first?

1002
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,324
I don't know.

1003
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,530
I came on impulse.

1004
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,970
I don't know why.

1005
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,681
That night I suddenly missed you
so much.

1006
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:03,125
We're drinking pals.
Of course you'll miss me.

1007
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,006
You're right.

1008
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,289
"We're drinking pals".

1009
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,361
Let's go.

1010
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:33,806
- Waiter.
- Yes?

1011
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,604
- The check.
- Yes.

1012
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,090
Where are you staying?

1013
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,722
In a hotel, a rather small room.

1014
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,811
But it's not too bad.

1015
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,001
I'll see you back.

1016
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,366
No, thanks.

1017
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,807
I've just moved in, it's a mess.

1018
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:00,081
I'll invite you
once it's cleaned up.

1019
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,286
I'll go first.

1020
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,369
<i>Seeing how much
Bai Ling had changed,</i>

1021
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,801
<i>I was suddenly overcome
by a feeling of grief.</i>

1022
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,889
<i>Indeed, last Christmas</i>

1023
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,003
<i>I was not in Hong Kong.</i>

1024
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,207
24 DECEMBER, 1969

1025
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,609
Have you seen Miss Su?

1026
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,009
Miss Su?
Not for some time.

1027
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,890
Any idea where she might be?

1028
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,969
Probably back in Phnom Penh.

1029
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,924
<i>I didn't want to spend
Christmas 1969 in Hong Kong</i>

1030
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,164
<i>so I visited Singapore
and went back to the casino.</i>

1031
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,204
<i>I waited for several days,
but Black Spider never turned up.</i>

1032
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,569
<i>No one knew where she was.</i>

1033
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,042
<i>Some thought she'd gone back
to Phnom Penh.</i>

1034
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,129
<i>Others thought she was dead.</i>

1035
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,970
<i>Ping and I began working
in Singapore in 1963.</i>

1036
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,448
<i>When my life lost
most of its meaning,</i>

1037
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,283
<i>I started gambling every day.</i>

1038
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,602
<i>Those were hard times for me.
Only one person</i>

1039
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,086
<i>came to my rescue.</i>

1040
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,890
<i>A professional gambler.</i>

1041
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,969
<i>Some said she was a cheat.</i>

1042
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,045
<i>She always wore black.
They called her Black Spider.</i>

1043
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:56,164
<i>She kept her black glove on
for 365 days of the year.</i>

1044
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,609
<i>Nobody knew why for sure.</i>

1045
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,411
<i>Had her hand been chopped off
for cheating?</i>

1046
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,167
<i>Did the glove cover up
a fake hand?</i>

1047
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,690
<i>Nobody really knew.</i>

1048
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,009
Why do you wear that black glove?

1049
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,571
It's a habit.

1050
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,930
You're not from here?

1051
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,164
I'm from Phnom Penh.

1052
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,004
What a coincidence!
I was just in Cambodia.

1053
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,845
It's in chaos.
Why were you there?

1054
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,210
The newspaper sent me.

1055
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,611
You're a journalist?

1056
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,046
Not any more.

1057
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,161
Why's that?

1058
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,805
They made some changes,
and I'm now a "consultant"

1059
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,369
on half pay,
with next to nothing to do.

1060
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,367
So why are you spending your time
in the casino?

1061
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:29,126
I tried to win enough
to pay my way back to Hong Kong.

1062
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,326
You lost a lot?

1063
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,050
A few thousand.

1064
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,205
You should never set foot
in a casino in a bad mood.

1065
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,410
You won't win.

1066
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,644
I didn't expect to win.
I just hoped to get back my stake.

1067
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,489
If you have any money left,

1068
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,171
I can help you.

1069
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,050
On one condition .

1070
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,163
When you've got your money back,

1071
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,971
stop gambling.

1072
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,685
Why are you helping me?

1073
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,970
I take a commission.

1074
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,725
10% of whatever I win for you.

1075
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,931
Think it over.

1076
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,768
<i>What good to her were her tiny
commissions on my winnings?</i>

1077
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,371
<i>After that, we went hack
to the casino night after night.</i>

1078
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,721
<i>We'd eat at the stall</i>

1079
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,809
<i>next to the railway station.</i>

1080
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,523
<i>She won back
all the money I'd lost.</i>

1081
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,121
Thank you.

1082
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,529
Don't thank me, it's yours.

1083
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,729
If you need me again tomorrow,

1084
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,968
I'll be waiting here after dinner.

1085
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,004
I still don't know your name.

1086
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,724
It's Su. Su Lizhen.

1087
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,443
<i>A few years ago I fell in love
with another man's wife.</i>

1088
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,001
<i>Her name was also Su Lizhen.</i>

1089
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,645
<i>It was because of her
that I moved to Singapore.</i>

1090
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,962
<i>I never dreamed I'd meet
another Su Lizhen.</i>

1091
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,843
<i>I told her a lot
about the other Su Lizhen.</i>

1092
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,609
At first, we kept it secret.

1093
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,089
But gossip soon spread.

1094
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,849
Later we moved into a hotel.

1095
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,323
We had Room 2046.

1096
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,087
When I think back,
the whole thing was like a dream.

1097
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,010
You loved her deeply?

1098
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,286
It's history.

1099
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,170
Let's change the subject.

1100
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:38,167
You, what did you do before?

1101
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:46,244
You want to know about me?

1102
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,089
Come on, we'll play high-low.

1103
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:59,368
If you win,
I'll tell you everything.

1104
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,281
<i>It struck me
that her past was like</i>

1105
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:22,529
<i>the hand she always kept gloved.
A mystery with no solution.</i>

1106
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:41,121
Of all the men I've met,

1107
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,769
you've been the best to me.

1108
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:50,447
I'm already missing you.

1109
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,571
Why won't you come with me?

1110
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,520
Didn't you

1111
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:10,250
promise not to ask?

1112
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,040
Hold me.

1113
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,601
It may be years
before we meet again.

1114
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,009
<i>The last time we saw each other</i>

1115
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,526
<i>I told her...</i>

1116
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,006
Take care.

1117
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,927
Maybe one day
you'll escape your past.

1118
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,563
If you do, look for me.

1119
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,211
<i>Now it strikes me...</i>

1120
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,210
<i>that what I told her
was actually meant for myself.</i>

1121
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,241
<i>In love,
you can't bring on a substitute.</i>

1122
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:54,562
<i>I was looking for what I'd felt
with the other Su Lizhen.</i>

1123
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,723
<i>I didn't realize that myself.</i>

1124
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,769
<i>But I'm sure she did.</i>

1125
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,370
WHEN THE PEONY BLOOMS

1126
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:22,086
SHE STANDS TALL
AND THEN GOES AWAY

1127
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,169
DOES SHE MEAN "NO" OR "YES"?

1128
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:27,007
All for me?
You want to get me drunk?

1129
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,089
I know you're a good drinker.

1130
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,725
Let's drink

1131
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:32,810
as much as we can.

1132
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:35,723
If there's any left over,

1133
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,011
finish it next time you're here.

1134
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:50,049
One small thing
I have to ask you.

1135
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,482
Here's some money,
please take it.

1136
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,921
What for?

1137
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:58,482
I know you borrowed
from a friend for my plane ticket.

1138
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,364
Pay him back.

1139
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,963
If there's any left,
pay my rent for me.

1140
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,409
Where did you get so much money?

1141
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,410
An old customer.

1142
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,167
He's always been fond of me.

1143
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,044
He treats me well.

1144
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:23,561
But he's too old for me,
so I never paid him much attention.

1145
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,685
I ran into him yesterday
while I was shopping.

1146
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,287
He insisted on buying me dinner.

1147
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,688
I needed money, so I went.

1148
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:44,371
After dinner,
I told him I needed money.

1149
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,368
He said I could have
as much as I wanted.

1150
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:57,049
I told him I needed $5,000.

1151
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,051
At first, I planned to save it
for Singapore.

1152
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:07,210
But I'm using it now.

1153
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,244
Don't be silly.

1154
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,242
You're still young.
You have great prospects.

1155
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,247
I borrowed the money
from my friends.

1156
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:24,329
They don't need it back yet.

1157
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,970
So keep this for yourself.

1158
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,922
Pay me back later,
there's no rush.

1159
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,123
Why are you so kind to me?

1160
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,210
Perhaps it's fate.

1161
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,009
Too bad it didn't last.

1162
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,247
I wish
it could have gone on longer.

1163
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,650
Don't be like this.

1164
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,809
Let me buy you dinner tonight.

1165
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,687
- Waiter, the check!
- Coming.

1166
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,371
No, let me.

1167
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:12,603
You're too kind.

1168
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:17,003
You've spent enough time
and money on me already.

1169
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,162
I don't want to owe you too much.

1170
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,523
I need to make a phone call.

1171
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,846
Please settle the check,
I'll be outside.

1172
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,046
Will you come in?

1173
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,841
No, thanks.

1174
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,091
Get some rest.

1175
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,729
I'll see you
to the airport tomorrow.

1176
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:42,080
Please don't.

1177
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:45,009
I'll be terribly sad
if you're there.

1178
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:50,844
Take good care of yourself.

1179
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,367
Why can't it be
like it was before?

1180
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,171
Please don't go.

1181
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,929
Stay with me tonight.

1182
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,410
Let me borrow you.

1183
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,364
Do you remember?

1184
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,530
You once asked me

1185
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:30,964
if there was anything
I wouldn't lend.

1186
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,484
I've given it a lot of thought.

1187
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,370
And now I know

1188
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,050
there is one thing...

1189
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,009
I'll never lend to anyone.

1190
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,290
<i>As I recall,</i>

1191
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,847
<i>that was the very last time
we saw each other.</i>

1192
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:39,084
<i>I haven't seen her
since that night.</i>

1193
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:53,287
<i>Why can't it be
like it was before?</i>

1194
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:03,883
HE DIDN'T TURN BACK.

1195
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:06,606
IT WAS AS IF HE'D BOARDED
A VERY LONG TRAIN

1196
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,167
HEADING FOR A DROWSY FUTURE

1197
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,886
THROUGH THE UNFATHOMABLE NIGHT.

1198
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:18,809
<i>Everyone who goes to 2046
has the same intention.</i>

1199
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,047
<i>They want to recapture
lost memories.</i>

1200
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,569
<i>Because in 2046...</i>

1201
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,809
<i>nothing ever changes.</i>

1202
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,491
<i>But nobody really knows
if that's true or not.</i>

1203
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,369
<i>Because nobody has ever come back.</i>

1204
