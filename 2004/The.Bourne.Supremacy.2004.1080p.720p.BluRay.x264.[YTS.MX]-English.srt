1
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,510
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

2
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,810
<i>We clear on that?</i>

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,945
<i>This is a live project.
You're a go.</i>

4
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,286
<i>You're a go.</i>

5
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:03,820
<i>Training is over.
Training is over.</i>

6
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,368
I'm okay. It's fine.

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,176
Just a headache.

8
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:05,222
<i>You're burning up.</i>

9
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,305
It's okay.

10
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,909
Just a headache.

11
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,890
Anything new?
No.

12
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,960
It's just bits and pieces.

13
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,704
I can hear Conklin's voice,

14
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,837
And there's that photograph, but...

15
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,010
I just can't stay with it.

16
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,348
But you're sure it's not
just a bad dream? It happened.

17
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,752
It was a mission.

18
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,916
And I was there.

19
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,156
You should write it down.

20
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,567
Two years we're scribbling in that
notebook... it hasn't been two years.

21
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,900
It's always bad, and now it's just
the same thing over and over again.

22
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:31,433
But that's why we write it down.
Because sooner or later, you remember something good.

23
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,705
I do remember something good.

24
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,978
All the time.

25
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,612
<i>I want one final go around.
All teams listen up.</i>

26
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,516
<i>- We are standing by for final green.
- Survey two, I need to know when you've got eyes.</i>

27
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,989
<i>This is survey two. I have eyes.
- Copy that.</i>

28
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,323
<i>Survey one, this is hub.
Do you have visual contact?</i>

29
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,854
<i>Hub, this is survey one.
Mobile one is in motion.</i>

30
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,836
<i>Survey three, that is good.</i>

31
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,708
Hub.
Director marshall from langley.

32
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,542
- Langley.
- Stand by, please.

33
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,652
<i>- Martin?
- I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller.</i>

34
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,315
We understand you're using
the full allocation for this buy.

35
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,551
It's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.

36
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:32,428
For a thief, a mole. If it does nothing more than narrow
the list of suspects, it's a bargain at 10 times the price.

37
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,763
<i>Hub, this is survey two.
Escort is breaking off.</i>

38
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,497
<i>Mobile one is entering the building.</i>

39
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,667
Gentlemen, I have the seller on-site and in play.
Quite frankly, there's nothing much more to discuss.

40
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,049
- All right, Pam. Your call.
- Go.

41
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,109
<i>- We're on.
Audio contact only.</i>

42
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,179
<i>Switching to channel one now.</i>

43
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,087
<i>Copy that. It's affirmative.</i>

44
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,218
<i>Hub, mobile one and seller
have entered the office.</i>

45
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,777
Copy that.

46
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,599
<i>This is everything?</i>

47
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,341
<i>Those were shots.</i>

48
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,214
Survey one, come in. Survey one, I need
to know what happened. What do you see?

49
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,309
<i>- Do you see any shadows? I see nothing.
- What is your visual?</i>

50
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,322
<i>- Get some men in there. Get some men in there right now.
- Pull it up, Kurt.</i>

51
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,685
<i>Eye contact. I don't care if it's visual...
mobile one, can you copy, please?</i>

52
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,696
- Are you there, mobile one?
- I'm sorry.

53
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,201
<i>What do you see?</i>

54
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,379
...petroleum association's annual
conference here in Berlin...

55
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,447
Is pekos oil chief executive officer
Yuri Gretkov.

56
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,053
<i>In just six years, gretkov has turned
pekos into an oil empire, which in turn...</i>

57
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,564
He's become one of
the wealthiest men in Russia...

58
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:01,198
After consolidating drilling rights in the
caspian sea and gaining control of one of the wo...

59
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,624
How much?

60
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,249
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

61
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,821
He is my friend.
There's been a death in the family.

62
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,086
I wonder if you've seen him.

63
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,430
- Hey.
- Get in.

64
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,495
<i>- What's wrong?
- We're blown.</i>

65
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,508
How? We pushed it. We got lazy.

66
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,155
<i>Idiot!</i>

67
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,826
- All right. That's twice now
I've seen the same guy.

68
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,887
I saw him in town.
He was at the telegraph office.

69
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,297
Are you sure? How-How can
you be sure? It's just wrong.

70
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,200
The guy, the car he's driving,
what he's wearing... it's just wrong.

71
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,004
<i>Look, Jason, let's stay calm. It
could be anybody. This is real.</i>

72
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,706
This is real. That's him.
That's him right there.

73
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,773
<i>- Get your head down.
Silver Hyundai. Get your head down.</i>

74
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,268
How far is he?

75
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,765
How far?

76
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,043
A hundred meters.

77
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,957
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

78
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,829
Switch.

79
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,230
Just head to the bridge.

80
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,785
<i>- Turn here. Cut through the field.
- Hang on.</i>

81
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,679
All right, you keep going to the shack.
I'll meet you there in one hour.

82
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,081
I'm gonna bail out on the other side of this
bridge. It's the only way he can follow us.

83
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,483
What if it's not who you think
it is? It's them. It's Treadstone.

84
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,045
Jason, don't do it.
Look, marie, I warned 'em.

85
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,421
I don't want you to do it. I told them what
would happen if they didn't leave us alone.

86
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,155
- It's never gonna be over like this. I don't want...
- We don't have a choice.

87
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,197
Yes, you do.

88
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,802
Thank you.

89
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,865
Two of these explosive charges placed on
the power lines, and one of them failed.

90
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,001
The fingerprints from the one
that didn't go off.

91
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,205
<i>And the germans can't match it?
No. Nobody's got it.</i>

92
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,683
<i>We checked out every database we could
access. But we're hooked into Langley now.</i>

93
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,083
Run it.
Okay.

94
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,397
What the hell's Treadstone?

95
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,994
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

96
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:09,417
Two men dead, three million
in cash gone, no Neski files,

97
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,394
<i>And all very public.</i>

98
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,591
This is still a clandestine agency, no?

99
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,600
I don't view this event
as a failure.

100
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,364
You call it a success?
We have a lead.

101
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:23,431
A fingerprint left by the assassin.
He's one of us.

102
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,872
- Who is it?
- What can you tell me about Treadstone?

103
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,906
Treadstone?
It's where the trail dead-ends.

104
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,919
If you want an answer,
you're going to have to give me...

105
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,218
A level-five S.C.I. Access.

106
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,795
We have a lead, marty.

107
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,923
All right.
You've got your clearance.

108
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,630
But you're on
a very short leash.

109
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,732
And you'll give a full report to the group.
I wanna know where you're going with this.

110
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,437
Sir.

111
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,317
<i>Ward?</i>

112
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,052
Yes?
Pamela Landy.

113
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,526
Hey, Pam.
What can I do for you?

114
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,086
I was hoping you had some
time for me. Time for what?

115
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:31,466
- I'm free right now, actually.
- That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule.

116
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,498
<i>Excuse me. I need to, uh...
excuse me. Can I help you?</i>

117
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,841
<i>Yeah, I'm here to see mr. Abbott.
Twenty minutes?</i>

118
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,710
See ya.

119
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,914
Operation Treadstone.
Never heard of it.

120
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,759
That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam,
i think you might've wandered past your pay grade.

121
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,494
That's a warrant from director marshall
granting me unrestricted access to...

122
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,537
<i>All personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.</i>

123
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,033
So, what are we looking at?
I wanna know about it.

124
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,103
Know about it? It was a
kill squad. Black-On-Black.

125
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,675
We closed it down two years ago. Nobody wants
to know about Treadstone. Not around here.

126
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,415
<i>So I think you better take this back to marty
and let him know exactly what you're doing.</i>

127
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,687
He does. I've been down to the
archives. I have the files, ward.

128
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,124
<i>- Let's talk about Conklin.
- What are you after, Pam?</i>

129
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,759
You wanna fry me?
You want my desk. Is that it?

130
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,632
I wanna know what happened.
What happened?

131
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:43,697
Jason Bourne happened. You got
the files. Then let's cut the crap.

132
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,768
<i>Conklin had these guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.</i>

133
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,040
<i>Bourne was his number-One. The guy went
for a job, screwed the op, never came back.</i>

134
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:58,215
<i>Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find
Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways.</i>

135
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,555
So you had Conklin killed?
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

136
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,117
I've given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency.

137
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,096
I've shoveled shit on four continents.
I'm due to retire next year.

138
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,157
But if you think I'm gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this,

139
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,727
You can go to hell... and marshall too.

140
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,469
<i>It had to be done.</i>

141
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,340
<i>And Bourne? Where is he now?
- Dead in a ditch.</i>

142
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,108
<i>- Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu. Who knows?
- I think I do.</i>

143
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,649
<i>I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.</i>

144
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,345
<i>During the buy, both our case officer
and the seller were killed.</i>

145
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,480
They were killed by Jason Bourne.

146
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,760
They're ready for us upstairs.

147
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:22,035
Seven years ago, $20 million of C.I.A. funds
disappeared during a wire transfer through Moscow.

148
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:27,545
In the investigation that followed, we were
contacted by a russian politician, Vladimir Neski.

149
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:31,605
Neski claimed we had a leak and that
we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

150
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,049
And were we?
We never found out.

151
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,417
We were negotiating a meet
with mr. Neski when he was killed.

152
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,456
- By who?
- His wife.

153
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,185
<i>The case had gone cold until a month ago
when we found a source.</i>

154
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,820
Another russian in Berlin who claimed
to have access to the neski murder files.

155
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,023
<i>We thought we had
another bite at the apple.</i>

156
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:54,499
<i>Turns out the assassin
was one of our own... Jason Bourne.</i>

157
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,766
<i>I know Treadstone's not
a very popular subject around here,</i>

158
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,368
But we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper.

159
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,847
This is Conklin's personal computer.

160
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:10,377
<i>His Treadstone files are bloated with code keys and
case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for.</i>

161
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:14,448
Buried in the hard drive, we found a deleted
file with an account number to a bank in zurich.

162
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:20,260
<i>At the time ofhis death, he was sitting on a
personal account in the amount of $ 760,000.</i>

163
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:25,064
You know what his budget was? We were throwing
money at him and asking him to keep it dark.

164
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,128
- It was his own account. He was up to something.
- This is supposed to be definitive?

165
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,107
<i>What's definitive is that I just lost two
people in Berlin. So what's your theory?</i>

166
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,738
Conklin's reaching out from the grave to
protect his good name? The man is dead.

167
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,079
- No one's disputing that, ward.
- For christ's sake, marty, you knew Conklin.

168
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,109
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

169
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,122
Cut to the chase, Pam.

170
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,522
<i>I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together,</i>

171
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,755
That Bourne's still involved and that whatever
information I was trying to buy in Berlin...

172
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,821
Was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

173
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,059
How's that scan?

174
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,969
<i>Excuse me, sir,
but you're not gonna believe this.</i>

175
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,006
Jason Bourne's passport
just popped up on the grid in naples.

176
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,111
Okay. Contact naples. They need
to know who they're dealing with.

177
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,946
Find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there.

178
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,647
Nah, it's nothing. Some guy's name
came up on the computer.

179
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,962
Yeah. Hey, listen, tom,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

180
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,329
All right.

181
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,182
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the U.S. Consulate.

182
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,652
I just have a few questions for you.

183
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,631
You're coming out oftangier.
Is that correct?

184
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,303
What's the, uh, nature
of your visit to naples?

185
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:38,029
Look, I don't know what you did, and
i don't know who you're working for.

186
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,036
But I promise you this...

187
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,096
You're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

188
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,914
This is nevins.

189
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,182
This is tom cronin, C.I. Operations officer
calling from Langley, Virginia.

190
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,691
- Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody?
- Yes, I do.

191
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,454
Listen, he's an agency priority target.

192
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,363
Call me back as soon as
he's secure. I understand.

193
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,844
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

194
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,906
<i>- He's being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate.</i>

195
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,264
- Hello.
- This is Pamela Landy, C.I. Supervisor.

196
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,928
<i>Where do we stand?</i>

197
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,801
I, uh, think he got away.

198
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,603
Damn it.

199
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,339
- Have you locked down the area?
- Locked it down? No. No.

200
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,473
This is, uh... this is italy.
They don't exactly lock down...

201
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,985
- How long have you worked for the agency?
- Me? For four years.

202
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:39,854
<i>If you ever wanna make it to five, you're gonna listen
to me real close. Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

203
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,223
Last week in Berlin he assassinated two
men... one a highly experienced field officer.

204
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,525
I want you to secure that area. I want any
evidence secured, and I want it done right now.

205
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,997
Is that clear?
Yes, sir... ma'am.

206
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,468
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes,
which means you're gonna call me back in 30.

207
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,131
<i>And when I ask you where we stand,
i had better be impressed.</i>

208
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,072
- Berlin?
- I already have a team in place there.

209
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,740
<i>I doubt that Bourne's in naples
ready to start a family.</i>

210
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,410
<i>- You have no idea what you're getting into.
- Do you have any idea?</i>

211
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,852
<i>From the minute he left Treadstone, he's killed and
eluded every single person that you've sent to find him.</i>

212
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,414
You read a couple of files on Jason Bourne, and
that makes you an expert? This is my case, ward.

213
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,155
<i>Enough. I want you both
on that plane.</i>

214
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,427
<i>We are, all of us, going to do what we were either
too lazy or inept to do the last time around.</i>

215
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,663
We're gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down.

216
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,332
I'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

217
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,366
- Is that definitive enough for you?
- Yes.

218
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,081
<i>Jason Bourne
is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

219
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,882
<i>Last week in Berlin he assassinated two
men... one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

220
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,650
I want that area...

221
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,385
<i>...he assassinated two men...
one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

222
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:52,122
<i>I want that area secured. I want any evidence
secured, and I want it done right now...</i>

223
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,676
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

224
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,180
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

225
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,089
<i>We clear on that?
We clear on that?</i>

226
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,396
<i>You'd been working at Treadstone
for three years,</i>

227
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,406
<i>And your cover at the time was what?</i>

228
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,170
That I was an american student in paris.

229
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,179
And what exactly did your job
with Treadstone in paris consist of?

230
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,978
<i>I had two responsibilities. One was
to coordinate logistical operations.</i>

231
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,211
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

232
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,754
<i>Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.</i>

233
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,757
- Because of what they had been through, they were prone to a variety of problems.
- What kind?

234
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,818
Depression, anger,
compulsive behaviors.

235
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,832
They had physical symptoms.
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

236
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,232
- Amnesia?
- Before Bourne? No.

237
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,637
The plane's ready.
There's a car waiting for you.

238
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,701
- Good luck.
- No. You were his local contact.

239
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,340
You were with him the night Conklin died.
You're coming with us.

240
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:32,677
- Langley pulled an image out of naples.
It's uploading right now.

241
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,513
It's coming in now.

242
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,451
<i>I need clearance.
- He's not hiding, that's for sure.</i>

243
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,956
- Why naples? Why now?
- Could be random.

244
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,118
- Maybe he's running.
- On his own passport?

245
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,856
- What is he actually doing?
- He's making his first mistake.

246
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,659
It's not a mistake.

247
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,232
They don't make mistakes.
They don't do random.

248
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,794
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

249
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,363
<i>The objective and targets always came
from us. Who's giving them to him now?</i>

250
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,773
Scary version?

251
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,176
He is.

252
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,002
- I emptied it.
- It felt a little light.

253
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,771
Put it down.

254
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:17,077
- Front.
- Sorry. Old habits.

255
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,085
Use your teeth.
Ah.

256
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,672
Word in the ether was
you'd lost your memory.

257
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,731
You still should've moved.

258
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,578
- What do you want?
- Conklin.

259
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,581
He's dead.

260
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:50,382
Shot dead in paris. Dead the night you
walked out. So who's running Treadstone now?

261
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:54,049
Nobody. They shut it down.

262
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,152
It's over. We're the last two.

263
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,228
If it's over,
then why are they still after me?

264
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,930
- I don't know.
- Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

265
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,236
- I don't know who that is.
- Pamela Landy and Berlin. What's going on in Berlin?

266
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:14,141
<i>I don't know.</i>

267
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,702
Why would I lie?

268
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,432
I thought you were here to kill me.

269
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,205
What'd you do?
I'm sorry.

270
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,373
Did you call it in?

271
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,377
Get up. Come on.

272
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,891
You have a car out front? The
keys are in my coat pocket.

273
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,895
But we should...
what?

274
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,363
<i>- Go out the back.
I have another car.</i>

275
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,401
Pamela Landy.

276
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,143
<i>Nein, mein herr.
Danke.</i>

277
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,583
Pamela Landy.

278
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,954
<i>Nein.</i>

279
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,929
<i>Pamela Landy, bitte.</i>

280
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,637
<i>Ja.</i>

281
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,471
Pamela Landy, please.
One moment, please.

282
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:55,205
Thank you.

283
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,271
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

284
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,249
<i>Just one second, please.</i>

285
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,481
Hello?

286
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,583
Hello?

287
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,392
I'm sorry, sir. The phone's busy
right now. Just try later. Thank you.

288
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,212
<i>Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?</i>

289
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,909
<i>Now, I wanna break this out
in boxes.</i>

290
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,920
<i>Naples outbound. Check everything. Flights,
trains, police reports. That's box one.</i>

291
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,785
- Teddy, that's yours.
- Got it.

292
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,427
<i>Box number two.
Call it 'prior connections. "</i>

293
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,225
I want to rerun all Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

294
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,631
<i>Kim, box three.
I want to identify his method of travel.</i>

295
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,263
<i>Stay on the local cops. We need a
vehicle, a parking ticket, something.</i>

296
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,901
Langley's offered to upload any satellite
imaging we need, so let's find a target for them.

297
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,611
<i>Danny, box four. I need fresh eyes. Review
the buy where we lost the Neski files.</i>

298
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:45,348
Timeline it with what we know about Bourne's
movements. Turn it upside down and see what we find.

299
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:52,424
<i>Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life with total control
for all those years. We should be a step ahead ofhim.</i>

300
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,158
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

301
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,952
- Pamela Landy.
- This is Jason Bourne.

302
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,558
<i>- Bourne?
- It's Bourne. We need 90 seconds to triangulate his position.</i>

303
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,027
What do you want?

304
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,860
Are you running Treadstone?

305
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,165
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago. You know that.

306
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,834
Then who's planning
the missions now?

307
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,277
There are no missions. It's over.

308
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,180
- Then what do you want with me?
- Berlin.

309
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,518
Have you forgotten
what happened in Berlin?

310
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:58,258
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.
You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

311
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,990
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

312
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:07,163
<i>- Neski... Vladimir Neski...
Vladimir Neski...</i>

313
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,740
Bourne?

314
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,246
<i>I wanna come in.</i>

315
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,458
<i>- Okay. How do you wanna do it?
- We need 35 seconds.</i>

316
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:33,258
- I need someone I know to bring me in.
- Who?

317
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,299
<i>There was a girl in paris.
She was part of the program.</i>

318
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,728
<i>She used to handle logistics. Alexander
Strasse, 30 minutes, under the world clock.</i>

319
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,968
<i>Send her alone.
Give her your phone.</i>

320
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,602
What if I can't find her?

321
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,805
It's easy.
She's standing right next to you.

322
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,389
- There's just so many areas...
- It's a very simple layout.

323
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,330
<i>Get the second quadrant.
Pull it out.</i>

324
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,836
<i>Where is it? Get the second quadrant,
please. Pull it all the way up.</i>

325
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,668
<i>Clock is right here...
shit, he's put her in the middle of everything.</i>

326
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,675
This is a security nightmare. There is
no way we are going to get her covered...

327
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,611
Call a mayday into Berlin station. We
need snipers, D.O.D., whatever they've got.

328
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,810
No snipers. You put snipers on the roof
and it'll scare him off, and I need answers.

329
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:32,082
- You can't really believe he wants to come in.
- He knows something about the neski case.

330
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,955
- I'm not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is.
- Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close.

331
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,187
Are we talking about protecting Nicky
or killing Bourne?

332
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:43,255
- We're talking about killing Bourne.
- We're talking about the next dead body. It might be nicky. It will be someone.

333
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,699
You're not hearing me.
Bourne dead gives me nothing.

334
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,837
Can I talk to you privately?

335
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,809
- What?
- I know how you're feeling.

336
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,511
You lost two men in Berlin
and you want it to mean something.

337
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,577
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

338
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:09,057
Nothing in those files makes their
sacrifice worthwhile. You have to let go.

339
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,721
We're professionals.
When an operation goes bad, we tie it off.

340
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,960
If there's something you're not telling me, I want it
now before I send that girl out there. Do you understand?

341
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,272
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

342
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,647
What do you want to do?

343
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,386
Put the snipers in place.

344
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,623
If things go bad,
we take him out.

345
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,493
You got it.

346
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,166
Hub, this is survey one.
We have a crowd moving in.

347
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,473
<i>- It's some sort of protest march.
- I'm sorry. This is as close as I can get.</i>

348
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,481
<i>- Survey two, can you get in any closer?
- Kurt, make sure the south end is covered.</i>

349
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,518
<i>Roger. Affirmative. Copy that.</i>

350
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:01,228
Hello. There's a tram coming
towards you. Get on it.

351
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,171
- She's moving to the tram.
- Where's it going?

352
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,335
<i>The tram is going
to Alexanderplatz station.</i>

353
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,842
<i>Survey five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.</i>

354
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,383
<i>Hub, this is survey two,
she's getting on a tram.</i>

355
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,518
- She's getting on the tram.
- Zoom in on the tram.

356
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,256
<i>- Bourne's on the tram.
- I don't think he's on the tram.</i>

357
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,730
<i>He's on the tram.</i>

358
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,002
- Send them in to follow.
Tell them to keep their distance.

359
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,039
<i>Okay, delta, let's go.
Get on it.</i>

360
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,406
Come on. Let's go.

361
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:44,106
<i>- Tell her to hurry.
- There's nothing on the south side.</i>

362
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,256
Alexanderplatz station,
25 seconds.

363
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:22,673
<i>This is survey three. There's a lot of protesters
here. There's no way we can cover out there.</i>

364
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:27,442
- Get her out of there.
- Go! Delta, move! Now!

365
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:49,122
<i>- She's not here. She's gone.
- Goddamn it!</i>

366
00:55:49,189 --> 00:55:51,417
<i>- They are not on the tram.
- He's one guy!</i>

367
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:54,787
<i>Jason, please don't hurt me.
What were my words?</i>

368
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:57,418
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

369
00:55:57,493 --> 00:56:00,980
I did. I swear. Jason, i
told them that I believed you.

370
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:03,426
I'm gonna ask you
some some simple questions.

371
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:07,291
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to god I'm gonna kill you.

372
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:10,022
- Delta, give me something.
- They're on it! They're on it!

373
00:56:10,096 --> 00:56:12,325
Who's pamela landy?

374
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:15,853
<i>She's a task force chief.
- Is she running Treadstone?</i>

375
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:18,693
No, she's the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?

376
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:22,756
<i>Last week an agency field officer tried
to make a buy off of one ofher ops.</i>

377
00:56:22,834 --> 00:56:26,494
He was trying to sell out a mole or
something and you got to him before we did.

378
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:28,693
<i>- I killed him?
- You left a print.</i>

379
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:31,760
<i>There were partial prints that trace
back to Treadstone. They know it was you.</i>

380
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,531
<i>- That is insane.
- Why are you doing this? Why come back now?</i>

381
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:38,128
Landy will find...
Stop. Stop.

382
00:56:38,205 --> 00:56:42,435
Last week I was 4,000 miles away
in India, watching Marie die.

383
00:56:42,506 --> 00:56:45,406
<i>They came for me,
and they killed her instead.</i>

384
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:47,465
<i>This ends now.</i>

385
00:56:52,444 --> 00:56:55,605
<i>Find her.</i>

386
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:59,636
- What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?

387
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:03,477
- Please! I'm only here because of paris. Abbott dragged us...
- Abbott? Who's abbott?

388
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:05,514
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.

389
00:57:05,582 --> 00:57:07,378
Is he here in berlin?
Yes.

390
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:09,383
Did he run Treadstone?

391
00:57:09,451 --> 00:57:12,508
Did he run Treadstone? Yes.
Conklin reported to him.

392
00:57:12,584 --> 00:57:14,516
Please. Please, I swear...

393
00:57:14,585 --> 00:57:18,643
What was landy buying? What kind of
files? Conklin... stuff on Conklin.

394
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:21,653
It was something to do
with a russian politician.

395
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:31,156
Neski. Wh-What? What
are you talking about?

396
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,953
<i>Training is over... training is over...
training is over...</i>

397
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:38,549
When... when was I here in Berlin?

398
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:41,526
What are you talking about? For
Treadstone. I did a job here.

399
00:57:41,593 --> 00:57:44,494
When? No, you never
worked in Berlin before.

400
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,892
My first job. In berlin.
You know my file.

401
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,827
- You've never worked Berlin before.
- My first job!

402
00:57:49,897 --> 00:57:52,556
No, your first assignment was
Geneva. You fucking people!

403
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,793
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, nicky!

404
00:57:55,866 --> 00:57:58,957
It's not in your file!
- I know I was here!

405
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:01,864
<i>No, I swear... oh, please.!</i>

406
00:58:19,806 --> 00:58:23,205
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's Alexanderplatz.

407
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:27,140
<i>We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They're all converging in a five-block radius.</i>

408
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,200
Over here, luftschulzbunker.
That was an old war shelter.

409
00:58:29,278 --> 00:58:32,677
How many men are out there? Two coming down the back
stairs. The rest, they're fanned out for a search.

410
00:58:32,746 --> 00:58:35,506
<i>- What's our security situation here?
- Where, "here"? The ground?</i>

411
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:39,570
<i>Here here. In the building. Check everything, and
recheck all the stairwells, hallways, everything.</i>

412
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,046
It's done.

413
00:58:42,116 --> 00:58:46,550
<i>Okay, let's go public.
Release his photo to the Berlin police.</i>

414
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:49,982
- And check out his story about the girlfriend in India too.
- I'm on it.

415
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:53,744
You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela,
and you don't have the shoes for it.

416
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:57,886
- He said he didn't know anything about Berlin.
- He knew that nicky was wearing a wire.

417
00:58:57,954 --> 00:59:01,820
- Don't you think that was for our benefit?
- He didn't sound like a man in control to me.

418
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:04,183
<i>We know he was in Berlin.</i>

419
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:06,553
His mind is broken.
We broke it. And now...

420
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,647
What now? Terminate him? You've been
pushing that agenda ever since we got here.

421
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:13,248
- He also said you were running Treadstone. Should we believe that too?
- I'm convinced bourne knows something.

422
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:15,315
He knows that you're after him,

423
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:19,657
And in the interest of self-Preservation
you might start with that.

424
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:22,421
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?

425
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,590
I need to show you
something.

426
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,627
All right, I finished my box work, but i
wanted to show you before I showed landy.

427
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:29,638
Came down here last night...

428
01:01:29,706 --> 01:01:31,638
Because none of this
is making any sense.

429
01:01:31,707 --> 01:01:34,137
I'm with you... conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?

430
01:01:34,206 --> 01:01:37,971
I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?

431
01:01:38,043 --> 01:01:41,439
All right, you put a four-gam Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.

432
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:43,703
You know that.

433
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:48,802
There were two charges that were supposed to go off
simultaneously. The second one, over here, didn't go off.

434
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:52,810
Now, first of all, this is nothing.
It's a sub-line for the breaker above.

435
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:55,312
And second, why put the charge
all the way down here?

436
01:01:55,382 --> 01:02:00,077
If you're good enough to get in here and handle the
gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.

437
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:02,081
Bourne would know.

438
01:02:02,148 --> 01:02:04,674
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No.

439
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:08,650
But what if somebody were trying to cover
their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne?

440
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:11,708
What if bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?

441
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,951
- Show me again.
- All right.

442
01:02:17,022 --> 01:02:19,113
Well, you put...

443
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:46,225
<i>Pull over. He's getting out.</i>

444
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:53,595
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?</i>

445
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:57,466
This is a live project,
and you're a go.

446
01:03:00,003 --> 01:03:02,993
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

447
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:24,572
- Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
- I want to get a room for the night.

448
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:27,634
Do you have a reservation?
No.

449
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:37,114
Actually, is room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.

450
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:44,906
<i>I'm sorry, sir. That room is
occupied. How about room 644?</i>

451
01:03:44,985 --> 01:03:47,508
<i>It's right across the hall.</i>

452
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:49,519
<i>Sir?</i>

453
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:53,816
644?
That's fine. Thank you.

454
01:03:53,887 --> 01:03:57,946
I just need your passport
and signature right here, please.

455
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:01,413
Have a nice night.

456
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:35,696
<i>Ja.</i>

457
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:04,810
<i>Berlin polizei.</i>

458
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:23,318
Where?
Brecker hotel.

459
01:05:23,385 --> 01:05:25,283
Okay, we're there.
Take the van!

460
01:05:25,353 --> 01:05:27,615
- Brecker? How far?
- About five or six minutes.

461
01:06:04,899 --> 01:06:07,957
<i>Hi!</i>

462
01:06:08,033 --> 01:06:10,933
Hey!

463
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:50,079
<i>Congratulations, soldier.</i>

464
01:06:50,148 --> 01:06:52,513
Training is over.

465
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:36,895
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

466
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,994
Go!

467
01:08:19,645 --> 01:08:24,510
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark t-shirt, dark pants.

468
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:28,809
The cops out there wanna corral all the
guests together and check 'em out one by one.

469
01:08:28,882 --> 01:08:31,075
That will really work.

470
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:34,172
What the hell's he doing here? Maybe
he just wanted to stay the night.

471
01:09:09,863 --> 01:09:12,194
<i>Polizei!</i>

472
01:09:23,467 --> 01:09:25,694
Polizei! Polizei!

473
01:09:31,103 --> 01:09:34,035
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

474
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:16,948
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

475
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:15,623
They missed him?
Yeah, so far.

476
01:12:15,692 --> 01:12:18,625
But they found Nicky. She's back
at the Westin. Bourne let her go.

477
01:12:18,693 --> 01:12:20,455
He let her go?
Yeah.

478
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:25,860
Where's danny zorn? He ought to
head over there and debrief her.

479
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:27,862
Why did Bourne come here?

480
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:31,159
We don't know yet. Landy's
upstairs in one of the rooms.

481
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,697
<i>She said she'd call you
when she's done.</i>

482
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:38,355
Okay.

483
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:44,463
I think I'll, uh... take a cab
back to the hotel.

484
01:12:49,571 --> 01:12:52,163
<i>So, the room he checked into
was across the hall.</i>

485
01:12:52,237 --> 01:12:54,171
Mmm.

486
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,467
Why would he come in here?

487
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:08,140
What are you thinking? I
recognize this room from a photo.

488
01:13:09,711 --> 01:13:13,108
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

489
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:17,371
This is where
his wife killed him?

490
01:13:17,447 --> 01:13:19,776
Do you still think
his wife killed him?

491
01:13:28,683 --> 01:13:30,877
Guess he got out
through this window.

492
01:13:32,385 --> 01:13:35,316
We just got word
from the berlin police.

493
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:37,216
They found Danny Zorn's body.

494
01:13:42,222 --> 01:13:46,280
I want you two to stay on Bourne.
Check everything that's out there.

495
01:13:46,356 --> 01:13:48,846
Call Abbott. Tell him to
wait for me in his hotel.

496
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,083
I'm coming to see him.

497
01:14:19,602 --> 01:14:22,229
<i>- Da.
- It's me.</i>

498
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:24,291
They're onto Neski.

499
01:14:25,602 --> 01:14:28,537
This is not a clean phone. They
can't prove anything without bourne.

500
01:14:28,605 --> 01:14:31,503
Kill Bourne,
and you kill this investigation.

501
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:36,006
I'm afraid, ward, the time has
come for us to part company.

502
01:14:36,073 --> 01:14:40,666
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with 20 million in stolen C.I.A. Seed money.

503
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:43,140
You owe me.
I gave you your cut.

504
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:45,368
We both got rich.

505
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:47,535
I don't owe you anything.

506
01:14:47,611 --> 01:14:51,171
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. You hear me?

507
01:14:51,246 --> 01:14:53,177
He's still out there.
Now get him.

508
01:14:53,245 --> 01:14:54,803
Get Jason...

509
01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:18,010
I don't suppose it would do me
much good to cry for help, huh?

510
01:15:20,022 --> 01:15:22,011
Not much.

511
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:25,849
You killed her.

512
01:15:25,925 --> 01:15:27,856
It was a mistake.

513
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:30,720
It was supposed to be you.

514
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:34,726
There were files linking me
to the Neski murder.

515
01:15:34,794 --> 01:15:38,750
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you,

516
01:15:38,828 --> 01:15:40,885
They'd be chasing a ghost
for 10 years.

517
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:42,895
So we got in the way.

518
01:15:42,963 --> 01:15:46,327
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?

519
01:15:46,397 --> 01:15:48,331
You killed marie...

520
01:15:48,398 --> 01:15:50,330
The minute
you climbed into her car.

521
01:15:50,398 --> 01:15:53,332
The minute you entered her life,
she was dead.

522
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,333
I told you people
to leave us alone.

523
01:15:56,401 --> 01:15:58,833
I fell off the grid.
I was halfway around the world.

524
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,767
<i>There's no place
it won't catch up to you.</i>

525
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:04,268
It's how every story ends.

526
01:16:04,336 --> 01:16:07,531
It's what you are, Jason...
a killer.

527
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:10,036
<i>You always will be.</i>

528
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:15,197
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

529
01:16:17,374 --> 01:16:19,841
She wouldn't want me to.

530
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,966
That's the only reason
you're alive.

531
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:41,131
I'm a patriot.
I serve my country.

532
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:44,466
And danny zorn? What was he? Unlucky.

533
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:48,294
Collateral damage.

534
01:17:51,106 --> 01:17:53,096
So, what do we do now?

535
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:56,203
I'm not sorry.

536
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:58,421
<i>No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he's here.</i>

537
01:18:58,496 --> 01:19:00,429
No, that's nothing.

538
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:02,894
<i>- Good synch-Up.
- Who's this guy?</i>

539
01:19:02,964 --> 01:19:05,157
<i>Platform "B"</i>

540
01:19:05,231 --> 01:19:08,323
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

541
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,922
<i>She wouldn't want me to.</i>

542
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,592
That's the only reason
you're alive.

543
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:26,901
Got a call from langley.

544
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,905
<i>They're, uh, going through
Abbott's records,</i>

545
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:33,134
<i>And marshall wants to know
what's going on with bourne.</i>

546
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:38,469
<i>Wait, teddy. Teddy, who's
this? Look at this guy.</i>

547
01:19:38,543 --> 01:19:40,635
<i>He's about to enter...
Right there! There!</i>

548
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,973
<i>Right through there.
That's bourne.</i>

549
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:46,136
<i>- Get down here! We got something!
- We got a sighting.! Check it out.!</i>

550
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:49,145
There. I got it on the big monitor.
Hold on.

551
01:19:49,213 --> 01:19:51,805
Here it comes again.

552
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,608
<i>- Whoa, whoa. Hold on. He's just entered frame.
- It's the coat. That's him!</i>

553
01:19:54,681 --> 01:19:57,274
What train is that?

554
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,908
- That's the train to Moscow.
- Why the hell would he go to Moscow?

555
01:20:02,984 --> 01:20:06,473
Get me
the russian interior ministry.

556
01:23:32,823 --> 01:23:36,086
<i>Da.</i>

557
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,911
<i>Da.</i>

558
01:36:30,589 --> 01:36:33,315
I speak english.

559
01:36:33,388 --> 01:36:35,380
I'm not gonna hurt you.

560
01:36:37,123 --> 01:36:39,113
I won't hurt you.

561
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:48,849
You're older.

562
01:36:52,861 --> 01:36:54,851
Older than I thought you'd be.

563
01:36:58,965 --> 01:37:00,895
That picture.

564
01:37:03,598 --> 01:37:06,361
<i>Does that mean a lot to you?</i>

565
01:37:08,268 --> 01:37:11,291
It's nothing.
It's just a picture.

566
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:13,358
No.

567
01:37:14,603 --> 01:37:17,535
It's 'cause you don't know
how they died.

568
01:37:17,603 --> 01:37:19,593
I do.

569
01:37:20,838 --> 01:37:22,828
No, you don't.

570
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,330
I would want to know.

571
01:37:35,009 --> 01:37:39,841
I would want to know that my...
that my mother didn't kill my father,

572
01:37:41,112 --> 01:37:43,045
That she didn't kill herself.

573
01:37:43,113 --> 01:37:45,103
What?

574
01:37:47,447 --> 01:37:51,040
It's not what happened
to your parents.

575
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,740
I killed them.

576
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,212
I killed them.

577
01:38:07,287 --> 01:38:09,448
It was my job.

578
01:38:11,855 --> 01:38:14,220
It was my first time.

579
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:22,114
Your father
was supposed to be alone.

580
01:38:26,562 --> 01:38:28,551
But then your mother...

581
01:38:30,795 --> 01:38:32,786
<i>Came out of nowhere,</i>

582
01:38:36,796 --> 01:38:39,287
<i>And I had to change my plan.</i>

583
01:38:45,067 --> 01:38:47,660
It changes things,

584
01:38:47,735 --> 01:38:49,668
That knowledge.

585
01:38:49,736 --> 01:38:51,725
Doesn't it?

586
01:38:57,073 --> 01:39:00,233
When what you love
gets taken from you,

587
01:39:04,273 --> 01:39:06,264
You wanna know the truth.

588
01:39:25,748 --> 01:39:27,739
I'm sorry.

589
01:40:25,802 --> 01:40:29,257
Pamela Landy.
I hear you're still looking for me.

590
01:40:33,705 --> 01:40:35,728
Bourne?
What do you want?

591
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,373
I wanted to thank you...

592
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,565
For the tape.

593
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:49,099
<i>We got what we needed.
It's all tied off. It's over.</i>

594
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,501
I guess I owe you an apology.

595
01:40:53,611 --> 01:40:55,803
Is that official?

596
01:40:55,877 --> 01:40:59,505
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

597
01:40:59,579 --> 01:41:01,443
Good-Bye.

598
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:04,105
Wait. Wait.

599
01:41:08,317 --> 01:41:10,249
David webb.

600
01:41:10,316 --> 01:41:12,248
That's your real name.

601
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:16,978
<i>You were born 4-15-71
in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

602
01:41:18,187 --> 01:41:21,177
<i>Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.</i>

603
01:41:24,721 --> 01:41:26,712
Bourne?

604
01:41:29,956 --> 01:41:32,946
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
