1
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,261
<i>Men are haunted by the vastness
of eternity.</i>

2
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,348
<i>And so we ask ourselves...</i>

3
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>...will our actions echo
across the centuries?</i>

4
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:10,273
<i>Will strangers hear our names
long after we're gone...</i>

5
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>...and wonder who we were...</i>

6
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,944
<i>...how bravely we fought...</i>

7
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,989
<i>...how fiercely we loved?</i>

8
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,654
Good day for the crows.

9
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:45,201
I told you yesterday
and I'll tell you again today.

10
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,871
Remove your army from my land.

11
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,873
I like your land.

12
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,543
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.

13
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,920
They fought bravely yesterday.

14
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,423
Not well, but bravely.

15
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,175
They won't fight for you.

16
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,385
That's what the Messenians said.

17
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,513
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

18
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,725
Now they all fight for me.

19
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,394
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.

20
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,897
It's too big, even for you.

21
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,733
I don't want to watch another massacre.

22
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:22,030
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

23
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,701
And if my man wins?

24
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,870
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

25
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm a generous man.

26
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,000
If mine wins,
you can keep your throne...

27
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,128
...but Thessaly falls
under my command...

28
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,548
...to fight with me whenever I call.

29
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,179
Boagrius!

30
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,031
This is my man.

31
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,203
Achilles!

32
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,172
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

33
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,467
Careful who you insult, old king.

34
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,057
My king, Achilles is not with the army.

35
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,977
- Where is he?
- I sent a boy to look for him.

36
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,266
I was having a good dream.

37
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,186
Very good dream.

38
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,816
King Agamemnon sent me. He needs to-

39
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,110
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

40
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,196
But my lord, it is morning.

41
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,034
They're waiting for you.

42
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,092
Are the stories about you true?

43
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,722
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

44
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,017
They say you can't be killed.

45
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,062
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

46
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,564
The Thessalonian you're fighting...

47
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:06,069
...he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

48
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,990
That's why no one will remember
your name.

49
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:22,085
<i>Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!</i>

50
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,005
<i>Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!</i>

51
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,227
Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow,
when you're better rested.

52
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,938
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

53
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,858
Perhaps you should fight him.

54
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,985
Achilles.

55
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,571
Achilles.

56
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,119
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

57
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,998
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

58
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,670
Think how many songs they'll sing
in your honor.

59
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,798
Let them go home to their wives.

60
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,267
Imagine a king who fights his own battles.
Wouldn't that be a sight.

61
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:27,400
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

62
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,862
We need him, my king.

63
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,573
For now.

64
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,211
Is there no one else?

65
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,468
Is there no one else?

66
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,099
Who are you, soldier?

67
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,062
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

68
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,314
Achilles?

69
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,900
I'll remember the name.

70
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,446
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.

71
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,574
Give it to your king.

72
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,702
He's not my king.

73
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,349
- Brothers in arms!
- Brothers in arms!

74
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,726
- Friendship!
- Friendship!

75
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,696
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together...

76
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,323
...Queen Helen and I salute you.

77
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,453
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

78
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,332
We fought many battles, Sparta and Troy.
And fought well!

79
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,962
But I have always respected your father.

80
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,715
Priam is a good king, a good man.

81
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,927
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

82
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,890
Hector, Paris, young princes, come.
Stand.

83
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,766
Drink with me.

84
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,729
Let us drink to peace.

85
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,150
To peace between Troy and Sparta.

86
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,655
May the gods keep the wolves in the hills
and the women in our beds.

87
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,140
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

88
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,770
Strong arm.
Thank the gods we made peace.

89
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,482
I've seen too many of my men struck down
with this arm.

90
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,775
Never again, I hope.

91
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,862
Only one man wields a sword
better than you.

92
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,030
Achilles.

93
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,365
That madman.

94
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:07,411
He would hurl a spear at Zeus himself.
If the god insulted him.

95
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:14,251
See that one over there?
I picked her special for you.

96
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,797
She's a little lioness.

97
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,885
Thank you.
My wife waits for me in Troy.

98
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,597
My wife waits for me right there.

99
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,057
Wives are for breeding.

100
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:32,061
You understand, for making little princes.
Come enjoy yourself tonight.

101
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,524
You make excellent wine in Sparta.

102
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,701
You shouldn't be here.

103
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,291
That's what you said last night.

104
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,419
Last night was a mistake.

105
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,631
And the night before?

106
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,218
I've made many mistakes this week.

107
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,111
Do you want me to go?

108
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,658
Yes.

109
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,338
Where should I go?

110
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,257
<i>Away.</i>

111
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,677
Far away.

112
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,111
I have something for you.

113
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,579
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

114
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,508
They're beautiful.

115
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,179
But I can't wear them.

116
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,515
Menelaus would kill us both.

117
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,436
Don't be afraid of him.

118
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,689
I'm not afraid of dying.

119
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,694
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

120
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:16,118
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

121
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,919
Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost.

122
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,673
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea...

123
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,968
...but I was just a ghost.

124
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,137
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

125
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,435
Come with me.

126
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,112
Don't play with me. Don't play.

127
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,533
If you come, we'll never be safe.

128
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,579
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

129
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,040
But I'll love you.

130
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,336
Till the day they burn my body...

131
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,172
...I will love you.

132
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,282
Tecton.

133
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,869
Make the proper offerings to Poseidon
before we sail.

134
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,205
We don't need any more widows in Troy.

135
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,624
Goat or pig?

136
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,044
Which does the sea god prefer?

137
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,506
I'll wake the priest and ask him.

138
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,094
Paris.

139
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,561
We should get to bed.
We won't sleep on land again for weeks.

140
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,355
I have no trouble sleeping on the seas,
brother.

141
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,524
Athena sings lullabies to me.

142
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,737
And who sang lullabies to you tonight?

143
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,697
Tonight?

144
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,410
Tonight was the fisherman's wife.

145
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,746
A lovely creature.

146
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,333
I hope you didn't let the fisherman
catch you.

147
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,711
He was more concerned with the fish.

148
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,047
You do understand why we're in Sparta.

149
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,465
For peace.

150
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:39,011
And you understand that Menelaus,
the king of Sparta, is a very powerful man.

151
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,680
And that his brother Agamemnon,
the king of Mycenae...

152
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,891
...commands all the Greek forces.

153
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,519
What does this have to do
with the fisherman's wife?

154
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,104
Paris...

155
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,565
...you're my brother and I love you.

156
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,234
But if you do anything
to endanger Troy...

157
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,113
...I will rip your pretty face
from your pretty skull.

158
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,912
Now get some sleep.

159
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,456
We sail in the morning.

160
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:35,401
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

161
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,780
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the afternoon.

162
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,908
Drop sail!

163
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,994
Do you love me, brother?

164
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,665
Would you protect me
against any enemy?

165
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,878
The last time you spoke to me like this...

166
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,382
...you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

167
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,759
What have you done now?

168
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,138
I must show you something.

169
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,631
- Where is she?
- Who, my king?

170
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,344
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

171
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,681
My king!

172
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,892
She left.

173
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,727
With the Trojans.

174
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,568
The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

175
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,070
The Trojans?

176
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,573
With the young prince, Paris. She...

177
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,499
Get my ship ready.

178
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,085
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

179
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,545
High on the sail!

180
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,255
- Wait, wait.
- You fool!

181
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,758
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what you've done?

182
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,428
Do you know how many years our father
worked for peace?

183
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,847
I love her.

184
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,934
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

185
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,938
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple mates.

186
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,106
You think you know
something about love.

187
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:42,653
What about your father's love? You spat on
him when you brought her on this ship!

188
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,740
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

189
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,663
I won't let you start a war for her.

190
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,331
May I speak?

191
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,586
What you're saying is true. I've wronged
you. I've wronged our father.

192
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,798
If you want to take Helen
back to Sparta, so be it.

193
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,342
But I go with her.

194
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,761
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

195
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,264
Then I'll die fighting.

196
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,017
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it? To die fighting.

197
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,187
- Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
- No.

198
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,398
- Ever seen a man die in combat?
- No.

199
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:23,819
I've killed men, and I've heard them dying.
And I've watched them dying.

200
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,822
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

201
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,242
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

202
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,619
And you know nothing about love!

203
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,664
All the same, I go with her.

204
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,041
I won't ask you to fight my war.

205
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,088
You already have.

206
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,592
To Troy!

207
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,803
About ship! Set sail!

208
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,589
- I want her back.
- Well, of course you do.

209
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,299
She's a beautiful woman.

210
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,053
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

211
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,598
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

212
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,850
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

213
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,894
I should have listened to you.

214
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,355
Peace is for the women...

215
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,732
...and the weak.

216
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,236
Empires are forged by war.

217
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,700
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

218
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,913
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

219
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,708
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

220
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,628
Never. You're a man of honor.

221
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,506
Everyone in Greece knows this.

222
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,550
The Trojans spat on my honor.

223
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,680
An insult to me is an insult to you.

224
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,267
And an insult to me
is an insult to all Greeks.

225
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,604
Will you go to war with me, brother?

226
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,245
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman...

227
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,915
...but she's proved to be very useful.

228
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,170
Nothing unifies a people
like a common enemy.

229
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,506
The Trojans have never been conquered.

230
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,800
Some say they can't be conquered.

231
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:57,639
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

232
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,101
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

233
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,895
But the gods protect only...

234
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,648
...the strong!

235
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,651
If Troy falls...

236
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:13,071
...I control the Aegean.

237
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,907
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

238
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,286
And Troy is built to withstand
a 10-year siege.

239
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,830
There won't be a 10-year siege.

240
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,417
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

241
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,879
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

242
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,964
Send emissaries in the morning.

243
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,382
One last thing.

244
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,886
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

245
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,514
Achilles.

246
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:46,188
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

247
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,775
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

248
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,944
That man was born to end lives.

249
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:57,532
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

250
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:02,162
Before me, Greece was nothing.
I brought all the Greek kingdoms together.

251
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,208
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

252
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,127
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

253
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,381
Achilles is the past.

254
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,886
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

255
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,598
How many battles have we won
off the edge of his sword?

256
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:25,018
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

257
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,604
We need the greatest warrior.

258
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,070
There's only one man he'll listen to.

259
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,739
I'll send a ship in the morning.

260
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,794
Greetings, brother.

261
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:54,840
We were told
King Odysseus is hid in the hills.

262
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,259
Odysseus?

263
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:03,139
That old bastard drinks my wine
and never pays.

264
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,060
You ought to respect your king, friend.

265
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,895
Respect him?

266
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,273
I'd like to punch him in the face.

267
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,401
He's always pawing at my wife,
trying to tear her clothes off.

268
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:25,120
I hope Agamemnon's generals
are smarter than his emissaries.

269
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,960
What did you say?

270
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,674
You want me
to help you fight the Trojans.

271
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,682
You're...

272
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,143
Are you...?

273
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,275
Forgive us, King Odysseus.

274
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,780
Well...

275
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,199
I'm gonna miss my dog.

276
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,912
King Agamemnon has a favor
to ask of you.

277
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,790
Of course he does.

278
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,234
Never hesitate.

279
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,962
Fancy swordplay.

280
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,384
Nervous?

281
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,805
Petrified.

282
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,976
You told me never
to change sword hands.

283
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,022
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

284
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,420
Your reputation for hospitality
is fast becoming legend.

285
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,720
Patroclus, my cousin.

286
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,931
Odysseus, king of Ithaca.

287
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,100
Patroclus.

288
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,562
I knew your parents well.

289
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,355
I miss them.

290
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,777
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

291
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,155
Learning from Achilles himself.

292
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,158
Kings would kill for the honor.

293
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,952
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

294
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,789
We need to talk.

295
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,795
I will not fight for him.

296
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:23,923
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

297
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,176
I'm asking you to fight for Greece.

298
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,636
Have the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

299
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,639
- For now.
- For the Greeks!

300
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,976
The Trojans never harmed me.

301
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,228
They insulted Greece.

302
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,232
They insulted a man who couldn't hold
on to his wife. Is that my business?

303
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,027
Your business is war, my friend.

304
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:47,405
Is it? Am I the whore of the battlefield?

305
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,075
The man has no honor.

306
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,911
I won't be remembered
as a tyrant's mercenary.

307
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,664
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

308
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,085
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

309
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,338
Forget Agamemnon.

310
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,048
Fight for me.

311
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:08,885
My wife will feel much better
if she knows you're by my side.

312
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,137
I'll feel much better.

313
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:14,432
Is Ajax going to fight in Troy?

314
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,436
They say he can fell an oak tree
with one swing of the ax.

315
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,232
Trees don't swing back.

316
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,946
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

317
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,282
A thousand ships.

318
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,035
A thousand ships?

319
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,163
Prince Hector. Is he as good a warrior
as they say?

320
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,542
The best of all the Trojans.

321
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,962
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

322
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,632
Even if your cousin doesn't come...

323
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:51,386
...I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

324
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,806
Play your tricks on me,
but not my cousin.

325
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,893
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

326
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,396
We play with the toys the gods give us.

327
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,066
We sail for Troy in three days.

328
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,407
This war will never be forgotten.

329
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,661
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

330
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:45,190
They say the king of Ithaca
has a silver tongue.

331
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,610
I knew they would come for you.

332
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,154
Long before you were born...

333
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,448
...I knew they would come.

334
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,830
They want you to fight in Troy.

335
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,965
I'm making you
another seashell necklace.

336
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,219
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

337
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,970
Do you remember?

338
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,812
Mother...

339
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,566
...tonight, I decide.

340
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:36,157
If you stay in Lárisa...

341
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,618
...you will find peace.

342
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,578
You will find a wonderful woman.

343
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,499
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

344
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,668
And they will love you.

345
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,088
When you are gone,
they will remember you.

346
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:57,345
But when your children are dead
and their children after them...

347
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,473
...your name will be lost.

348
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,645
If you go to Troy...

349
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,399
...glory will be yours.

350
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:15,113
They will write stories about your
victories for thousands of years.

351
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,325
The world will remember your name.

352
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,830
But if you go to Troy...

353
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,751
...you will never come home.

354
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:33,881
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

355
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,553
And I shall never see you again.

356
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,600
You know this to be true, Mother?

357
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:47,437
I know this.

358
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,618
- My son.
- Father.

359
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,958
Paris.

360
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,050
Father.

361
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,346
- This is Helen.
- Helen?

362
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,891
Helen of Sparta?

363
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,728
Helen of Troy.

364
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,404
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

365
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,574
For once...

366
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,993
...the gossips were right.

367
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,623
Welcome.

368
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,584
Thank you, good king.

369
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,128
Come, you must be tired.

370
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,518
Look.

371
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,104
He's grown.

372
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,524
He is strong.

373
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,859
He's just like his father.

374
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,738
- Paris!
- Briseis!

375
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,912
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

376
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:35,831
Briseis.

377
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,710
A servant of Apollo now.

378
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:44,298
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

379
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,591
Uncle.

380
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:52,723
I thank the gods for your safe return.

381
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,979
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

382
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,897
For gods.

383
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,497
Father...

384
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,166
...I know this is the last thing we need.

385
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,838
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.

386
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:28,926
- But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
- If I'd let him fight Menelaus for her...

387
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,971
...you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

388
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,890
We could send peace envoys
to Menelaus.

389
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,185
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

390
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,771
What would you have me do?

391
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,734
Put her on a ship and send her home.

392
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,906
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back.

393
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,992
But this is different.

394
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,494
Something has changed in him.

395
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,457
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

396
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,336
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

397
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:07,006
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

398
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,092
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

399
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,553
By now, Menelaus has gone
to Agamemnon.

400
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,556
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

401
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,100
Once we're out of the way,
he controls the seas.

402
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:23,272
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries. Our walls still stand.

403
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,901
Father, we can't win this war.

404
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:30,112
Apollo watches over us.

405
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,824
Even Agamemnon is no match
for the gods.

406
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,744
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

407
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,496
Do not mock the gods.

408
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,920
When you were very young,
you came down with scarlet fever.

409
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:49,215
Your little hand was so hot.

410
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:52,635
The healer said
you would not last the night.

411
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:58,766
I went down to Apollo's temple
and I prayed until the sun came up.

412
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:03,229
That walk back to the palace
was the longest of my life.

413
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:07,775
But I went into your mother's room
and you were sleeping in her arms.

414
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,694
The fever had broken.

415
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:14,448
I promised that day
to dedicate my life to the gods.

416
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,617
I will not break my promise.

417
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:21,539
For thirty years I have worked for peace.
Thirty years.

418
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,000
Paris is a fool sometimes, I know that.

419
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:29,964
But I will fight 1000 wars
before letting him die.

420
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:34,969
Forgive me, Father,
but you won't be the one fighting.

421
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,615
They're coming for me.

422
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,493
The wind is bringing them closer.

423
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,328
What if we left?

424
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,331
Tonight. Right now.

425
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,294
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

426
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,963
Ride east, keep riding.

427
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,841
- And go where?
- Away from here.

428
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,762
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.

429
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,184
But this is your home.

430
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,312
You left your home for me.

431
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,443
Sparta was never my home.

432
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,363
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

433
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,990
But it was never my home.

434
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,075
We'll live off the land.

435
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,205
No more palaces for us. No more servants.
We don't need any of that.

436
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,790
And your family?

437
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,794
We'd be protecting my family. If we're
not here, what's the need for war?

438
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:53,756
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

439
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,843
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

440
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,887
You don't know Menelaus.

441
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,181
You don't know his brother.

442
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:06,227
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

443
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,980
They'll never believe we've left.

444
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,901
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

445
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,657
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

446
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,954
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

447
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,882
You're very young, my love.

448
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,345
We're the same age.

449
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:46,308
You're younger than I ever was.

450
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,989
Take up your positions!

451
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:56,350
Black sail. It's Achilles.

452
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:57,935
What's the fool doing?

453
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:02,022
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

454
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,986
Row, Myrmidon, row!

455
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,533
My lord?

456
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,203
Should we wait for the others?

457
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:20,374
- They brought us here for war.
- Yes, but Agamemnon's orders-

458
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,043
You fight for me, Eudorus,
or Agamemnon?

459
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,545
For you, my lord.

460
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:29,133
Then fight for me. And let the servants
of Agamemnon fight for him.

461
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,810
Make way there! Make way!

462
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:53,949
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

463
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:57,369
- Waiting at the city gates.
- Good. I'll be right there.

464
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,998
Lysander, how long
before the army is ready?

465
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,293
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them-

466
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,961
- How long?
- Noon.

467
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,796
Make it sooner.

468
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:11,175
And Lysander, I want patrols
to scour the countryside.

469
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,093
I want every home
and pasture checked...

470
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:15,387
...every Trojan to be
brought inside the city walls.

471
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,472
If they can't walk, carry them.

472
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,114
Patroclus!

473
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,660
Put down your spear.

474
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,913
- I'm fighting the Trojans.
- Not today.

475
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,998
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

476
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:47,044
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

477
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,464
Look at these men.

478
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:54,927
They are the fiercest soldiers in all
of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.

479
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,095
- Guard the ship.
- But this is a war.

480
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:01,558
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
concerned for you. Guard the ship.

481
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:24,498
Trojans!

482
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:30,254
All my life, I've lived by a code.

483
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,798
And the code is simple:

484
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:36,468
Honor the gods, love your woman...

485
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:37,886
...and defend your country.

486
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,266
Troy is mother to us all.

487
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,142
Fight for her!

488
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:04,705
Myrmidons...

489
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,166
...my brothers of the sword.

490
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:13,005
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

491
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,550
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

492
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:25,225
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

493
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,562
Immortality! Take it! It's yours!

494
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,035
Fight positions!

495
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,078
Archers!

496
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,748
Archers, draw!

497
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,084
Draw!

498
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,394
Keep forward!

499
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,332
Form up!

500
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,376
Formation!

501
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,212
The man wants to die.

502
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,109
On my command!

503
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,785
Break off! Break off!

504
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,604
<i>Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!</i>

505
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,481
<i>Achilles! Achilles!</i>

506
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:42,195
<i>Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!</i>

507
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,490
Give him the battle,
we'll take the war.

508
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,828
Give him too many battles and
the men will forget who's king.

509
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,428
Ajax, you need to see this.

510
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:09,723
Look at him...

511
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,601
...hogging all the glory.

512
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,771
Row, you lazy whores, row!

513
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,858
Greeks are dying! Row!

514
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:52,098
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.

515
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:08,114
I am Ajax, breaker of stones!

516
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,159
Look upon me and despair!

517
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:14,246
Flank! To the flank!

518
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:07,048
No!

519
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,247
<i>Achilles! Achilles!</i>

520
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:47,714
Back to the city! Back to the city!

521
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,775
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

522
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,654
Take whatever treasure you can find.

523
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,579
With your permission, my lord.

524
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,504
- Speak.
- Apollo sees everything.

525
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:30,465
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

526
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,532
Warn the men.

527
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,326
Wait.

528
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:54,067
You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

529
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:57,570
You must be Hector.

530
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:07,747
Do you know who I am?

531
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,752
These priests weren't armed.

532
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:19,133
Yes. There's no honor
in cutting old men's throats.

533
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:23,054
Only children and fools fight for honor.

534
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,056
I fight for my country.

535
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,643
Fight me!

536
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,610
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...

537
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,737
...with no one here to see you fall?

538
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,085
Why did you come here?

539
01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:57,130
They'll be talking about this war
for 1000 years.

540
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,509
In 1000 years, the dust
from our bones will be gone.

541
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:05,054
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

542
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:19,694
Go home, prince. Drink some wine,
make love to your wife.

543
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,905
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

544
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,577
You speak of war as if it's a game.

545
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:31,539
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

546
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:36,794
Your brother can comfort them. I hear
he's good at charming other men's wives.

547
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,519
My lord, you let him go?

548
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,484
It's too early in the day for killing princes.

549
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:34,185
<i>Achilles! Achilles!</i>

550
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:40,274
<i>Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!</i>

551
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,103
- Achilles.
- Ajax.

552
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:22,150
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

553
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,735
As am I.

554
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:26,988
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

555
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:29,782
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here
at the end.

556
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,951
My lord?

557
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:34,328
I've got something to show you.

558
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,683
The men found her hiding in the temple.

559
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:57,769
They thought she'd...

560
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:00,438
...amuse you.

561
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,159
What's your name?

562
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,165
Did you not hear me?

563
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,543
You killed Apollo's priests.

564
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,879
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

565
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:27,131
Then your men did.

566
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,509
The sun god will have his vengeance.

567
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,011
What's he waiting for?

568
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:34,388
The right time to strike.

569
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:40,019
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

570
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,732
- I think your god is afraid of me.
- Afraid?

571
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:48,194
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

572
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:51,197
- Where is he?
- You're nothing but a killer!

573
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:54,117
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

574
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,956
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

575
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,125
I've seen them.

576
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,383
You're royalty, aren't you?

577
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,555
Spent years talking down to men.

578
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,394
You must be royalty.

579
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,064
What's your name?

580
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:33,531
Even the servants of Apollo have names.

581
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,247
Briseis.

582
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,335
Are you afraid, Briseis?

583
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,921
Should I be?

584
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:54,093
My lord.

585
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:59,015
Agamemnon requests your presence.

586
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:02,476
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

587
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:06,647
You fought well today.

588
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,775
My lord.

589
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,866
What do you want here in Troy?

590
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,869
You didn't come for the Spartan queen.

591
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:21,787
I want what all men want.

592
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,956
I just want it more.

593
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,465
You don't need to fear me, girl.

594
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:35,676
You're the only Trojan who can say that.

595
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,306
King Triopas, my lord.

596
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:27,520
You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

597
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:32,650
No one thought the Trojan beach
could be captured so easily.

598
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,528
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

599
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:41,534
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy tomorrow.

600
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:49,500
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to
commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

601
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,502
I present it to you...

602
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,547
...in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

603
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,382
Thank you, old friend.

604
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,886
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

605
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,147
Leave us.

606
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:23,909
War is young men dying and old men
talking. You know this.

607
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,162
Ignore the politics.

608
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:45,431
Apparently, you won some great victory.

609
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:51,270
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan
beach belonged to Priam in the morning.

610
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:54,315
It belongs to Agamemnon
in the afternoon.

611
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:56,817
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

612
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,277
No.

613
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:02,323
You came here because you want
your name to last through the ages.

614
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,827
A great victory was won today.

615
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,539
But that victory is not yours.

616
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,125
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

617
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:16,087
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

618
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:19,882
Perhaps the kings were too far behind
to see. Soldiers won the battle.

619
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,301
History remembers kings!

620
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:24,553
Not soldiers.

621
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,225
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

622
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,144
I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

623
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:35,398
I'll carve "Agamemnon" in the stone.

624
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,109
My name will last through the ages.

625
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:41,987
Your name is written in sand...

626
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,115
...for the waves to wash away.

627
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:48,786
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.

628
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:56,127
Your men sacked the temple
of Apollo, yes?

629
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:58,003
You want gold? Take it.

630
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,257
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

631
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:03,342
I already have.

632
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,263
Aphareus!

633
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:09,849
Haemon!

634
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,235
The spoils of war.

635
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:25,781
No argument with you, but if you don't
release her, you'll never see home again.

636
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,617
- Decide.
- Guards!

637
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:31,996
Stop!

638
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:35,124
Too many people have died today.

639
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,962
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

640
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,340
I don't want anyone dying for me.

641
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:57,855
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl.

642
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:05,362
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

643
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,698
And then...

644
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,618
- ... who knows?
- You sack of wine!

645
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:16,790
Before my time is done, I will look
down on your corpse and smile.

646
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:37,788
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

647
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:43,711
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

648
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:48,090
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

649
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:50,175
So, what do you suggest?

650
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,969
We surrender our city?

651
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:56,181
We allow the Greeks to slaughter our men?
Rape our wives?

652
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,100
I suggest diplomacy.

653
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,352
The Greeks came here for one thing.

654
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,565
Let's be honest, my friends.
Trojans are now burning on the pyre...

655
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:09,528
...because of one youthful indiscretion.

656
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,031
Glaucus.

657
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:16,285
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

658
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:19,163
Our walls have never been breached.

659
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,707
We have the finest archers in the world.

660
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,834
And we have Hector...

661
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:28,547
...whose men would fight
the shades of Tartarus if he commanded.

662
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:31,550
Yes, we can win.

663
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,604
I spoke with two farmers today.

664
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:48,942
They saw an eagle flying
with a serpent clutched in its talons.

665
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:52,655
This is a sign from Apollo.

666
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,074
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

667
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,784
Bird signs.

668
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,828
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

669
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,538
Hector, show respect.

670
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:06,752
When Archeptolemus prophesied
four years of drought we dug deeper wells.

671
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,005
The drought came
and we had water to drink.

672
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,050
The high priest is a servant of the gods.

673
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:15,219
And I am a servant of Troy.

674
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,932
I've always honored the gods, Father.
You know that.

675
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,644
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

676
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:26,522
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

677
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:30,025
The gods won't fight this war for us.

678
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,112
There won't be a war.

679
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,119
This is not a conflict of nations.

680
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:42,579
It is a dispute between two men.

681
01:15:43,665 --> 01:15:46,208
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

682
01:15:46,418 --> 01:15:48,127
Paris.

683
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,965
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.

684
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:58,887
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.

685
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,818
Does he have a chance?

686
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,330
Father...

687
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,209
...I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you.

688
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,962
Do you love her?

689
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:38,844
You are a great king because you love
your country so much.

690
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:41,221
Every blade of grass.

691
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:44,183
Every grain of sand.

692
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:45,934
Every rock in the river.

693
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,271
You love all of Troy.

694
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,026
That is the way I love Helen.

695
01:16:57,447 --> 01:17:00,532
I've fought many wars in my time.

696
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:05,537
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

697
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:13,086
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

698
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:16,173
But I won't be the one fighting.

699
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,220
The sword of Troy.

700
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,599
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him...

701
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:28,393
...all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

702
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:32,731
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

703
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,236
Carry it with you tomorrow.

704
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:44,159
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

705
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,289
So long as a Trojan carries it...

706
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,918
...our people have a future.

707
01:17:57,048 --> 01:18:00,259
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple...

708
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:03,971
...I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

709
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,723
An impossible throw.

710
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,437
He has no idea what's happening.

711
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,647
Thank the gods.

712
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,109
Don't go tomorrow.

713
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,863
- Please don't go.
- Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

714
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:26,451
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross the sea
to watch your brother fight. You know this.

715
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,622
You'd make a fine general, my love.

716
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:35,294
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

717
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:40,299
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

718
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:42,593
I want to see the girls chasing after him.

719
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:44,928
Just like they chased his father.

720
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:49,850
He's much more handsome than I ever was.

721
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:53,979
I must see Paris.

722
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:55,981
I lost...

723
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:58,692
...seven brothers...

724
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,445
...in the Spartan wars.

725
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,991
You'd think I'd be good at losing by now.

726
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:11,079
I can't lose you.

727
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,291
I won't survive.

728
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:41,443
Wait.

729
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:43,862
Wait!

730
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,702
Helen, what are you doing?

731
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,996
- Let me go.
- No.

732
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:02,381
I saw them burn.

733
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,343
I saw them burning on the pyres.

734
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:10,222
That's my fault.

735
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,017
It is. You know it is.

736
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:17,729
All those widows.

737
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:21,108
I still hear them screaming.

738
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:25,946
Their husbands died because I'm here.

739
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:28,532
I'm going down to the ships.

740
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,367
No, you're not.

741
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,578
I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.

742
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:35,789
He can do what he wants.

743
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:38,125
Kill me, make me his slave, I don't care.

744
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,751
Anything is better than this.

745
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,545
It's too late for that.

746
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:44,756
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

747
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:47,342
This is about power. Not love.

748
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,345
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

749
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:53,974
- Yes.
- Menelaus will kill him.

750
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:55,475
I won't let that happen.

751
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:58,103
- It's his decision.
- No.

752
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:01,106
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

753
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:04,776
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

754
01:21:07,155 --> 01:21:09,406
You're a princess of Troy now...

755
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:13,326
...and my brother needs you tonight.

756
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,779
My lord.

757
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,826
The army is marching.

758
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,163
Let them march. We stay.

759
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:00,499
But the men are ready.

760
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,502
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

761
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,505
As you wish.

762
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,566
Are you ready to fight?

763
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:28,777
I am.

764
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:31,363
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

765
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:45,168
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

766
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,256
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

767
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,052
They're waiting for me.

768
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,181
They say, "Welcome, brother. "

769
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:07,315
We men are wretched things.

770
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:16,366
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

771
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:18,076
I fight for you.

772
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:20,245
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

773
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:26,293
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

774
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:30,046
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

775
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:32,841
Soldiers obey.

776
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:43,435
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

777
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,274
Go.

778
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:16,236
Are you sure you want to do this?

779
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:19,072
I started this war.

780
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:36,631
Helen...

781
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,259
...sit with me.

782
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:53,023
All my life I have prayed against this day.

783
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,067
Yes, my king.

784
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:59,237
Call me Father, dear child.

785
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:05,243
Forgive me, Father...

786
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,996
...for bringing this.

787
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:11,041
I blame you for nothing.

788
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:15,253
Everything is in the hands of the gods.

789
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:17,172
Besides...

790
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:21,926
...how could I blame anyone
for falling in love with Paris?

791
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,727
Prepare to halt!

792
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,645
Prepare to halt!

793
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,564
Halt!

794
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:00,585
Move.

795
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:12,430
Menelaus is a bull.

796
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:17,018
He'll charge you,
but keep your distance and use your speed.

797
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:19,729
Brother...

798
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:22,690
...you don't have to do this.

799
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:48,424
I see you're not hiding behind
your high walls. Valiant of you.

800
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:51,344
lll-advised, but valiant.

801
01:29:51,512 --> 01:29:55,265
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

802
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,433
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

803
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:00,061
Prince? What prince?

804
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:03,064
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality...

805
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:07,569
...eat his food, drink his wine, then steal
his wife in the middle of the night?

806
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,821
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

807
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:14,742
She's up there, watching,
isn't she? Good.

808
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,161
I want her to watch you die.

809
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,497
Not yet, brother.

810
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:23,376
Look around you, Hector.

811
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:27,130
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

812
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:29,299
You can still save Troy, young prince.

813
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:30,925
I have two wishes.

814
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:34,429
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

815
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:37,599
First, you must give Helen
back to my brother.

816
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:41,352
Second, Troy must submit
to my command...

817
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:44,230
...to fight for me whenever I call.

818
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:47,442
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

819
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:51,237
Well, I see them.

820
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:56,451
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

821
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:01,706
Careful, boy.

822
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,792
My mercy has limits.

823
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,378
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

824
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:12,008
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

825
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:16,387
Then every son of Troy shall die.

826
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,559
There is another way.

827
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:27,940
I love Helen. I won't give her up
and neither will you.

828
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:29,776
So let us fight our own battle.

829
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:33,738
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

830
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:37,575
A brave offer, but not enough.

831
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:40,828
Let me kill this little peacock.

832
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:45,750
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

833
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:48,211
I came for my honor.

834
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:50,797
His every breath insults me.

835
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:54,759
Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, signal to attack.

836
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:58,096
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

837
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:05,103
So be it.

838
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:13,736
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.

839
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:26,457
- My lord.
- Back to the line!

840
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,433
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

841
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:46,477
Brother...

842
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:49,731
...if I fall, tell Helen- Tell her-

843
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:51,649
I will.

844
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:53,901
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he-

845
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:57,488
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

846
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,770
Get up.

847
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:12,897
Come on.

848
01:34:58,193 --> 01:34:59,610
See the crows?

849
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:03,739
They never tasted prince before.

850
01:35:38,108 --> 01:35:42,486
Is this what you left me for?!

851
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,322
Fight!

852
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:45,990
Fight me!

853
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:48,367
You coward!

854
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:49,827
Fight me!

855
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:52,371
We have a pact! Fight!

856
01:35:52,915 --> 01:35:55,875
Fight him, son. Fight him.

857
01:35:56,043 --> 01:35:59,837
- Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!

858
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:02,548
Prepare for battle!

859
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:05,635
This is not honor!

860
01:36:05,886 --> 01:36:08,346
This is not worthy of royalty!

861
01:36:08,764 --> 01:36:11,891
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

862
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,018
Paris.

863
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,480
No. No.

864
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:19,523
The fight is over.

865
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,859
The fight is not over.

866
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:23,736
Stand back, Prince Hector.

867
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:26,572
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

868
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,032
He is my brother.

869
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,381
Paris!

870
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:36,183
Go! Go!

871
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:44,859
Get inside, Paris!

872
01:37:45,444 --> 01:37:46,736
Archers!

873
01:37:50,157 --> 01:37:53,367
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back.

874
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:55,244
Pull back, you fool!

875
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:56,746
For Troy!

876
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:58,039
For Troy!

877
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:26,734
- Now!
- Loose!

878
01:38:58,350 --> 01:38:59,767
Get them in line!

879
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:09,151
Get the men back into lines!

880
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:11,695
Front line, push!

881
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:23,893
So you're the best of the Trojans.

882
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:40,761
Forward.

883
01:41:40,929 --> 01:41:42,179
Forward!

884
01:41:58,613 --> 01:41:59,905
Forward!

885
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:17,214
Apollonians! Now!

886
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:32,521
Prince Hector!

887
01:42:40,697 --> 01:42:42,031
We need to retreat!

888
01:42:42,991 --> 01:42:45,200
My army's never lost a battle yet!

889
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:47,870
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

890
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:58,297
Back to the ships!

891
01:42:58,465 --> 01:43:00,174
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!

892
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,342
- Back!
- Retreat!

893
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:03,302
Go back!

894
01:43:11,478 --> 01:43:13,312
Back. Back to the ships!

895
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:21,505
Fall back!

896
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:24,383
- Men, fall back!
- Halt!

897
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:33,058
Halt!

898
01:44:33,268 --> 01:44:34,726
But we have them on the run!

899
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:37,187
We're in range of their archers.

900
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:39,231
Have our men gather our fallen.

901
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:42,359
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

902
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:45,028
Would they have done the same for us?

903
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:49,575
Go! Back!

904
01:44:50,452 --> 01:44:52,161
Fall back into line!

905
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:59,061
Before I leave...

906
01:45:59,312 --> 01:46:02,856
...I will burn their city to the ground.

907
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:06,860
Brother, I promise you that.

908
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:40,602
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

909
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:43,981
They think I'll sail home at first light.

910
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,482
Maybe we should.

911
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:47,985
Flee? Like a whipped dog?

912
01:46:48,194 --> 01:46:51,822
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

913
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:54,741
Won't be needing her anymore.

914
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:58,078
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

915
01:46:58,288 --> 01:47:00,914
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

916
01:47:01,124 --> 01:47:04,209
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

917
01:47:04,419 --> 01:47:08,839
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?

918
01:47:09,007 --> 01:47:13,510
If we stay, we stay here
for the right reasons.

919
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:15,846
To protect Greece, not your pride.

920
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:18,765
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

921
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:20,183
Achilles is one man.

922
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,769
Hector is one man.

923
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:24,771
Look what he did to us today.

924
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:28,942
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

925
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:33,864
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

926
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:35,657
He's right.

927
01:47:35,825 --> 01:47:37,284
The men's morale is weak.

928
01:47:37,452 --> 01:47:40,579
Weak? They're ready to swim home.

929
01:47:40,747 --> 01:47:45,667
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

930
01:47:46,544 --> 01:47:50,005
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

931
01:47:51,549 --> 01:47:53,008
I'll talk to him.

932
01:47:53,593 --> 01:47:55,010
He'll want the girl back.

933
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:56,887
He can have that damn girl.

934
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:01,933
I haven't touched her.

935
01:48:02,894 --> 01:48:04,186
Where is she?

936
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:07,397
I gave her to the men.

937
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:14,071
They need some amusement after today.

938
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:20,202
Come on, give the bitch to me!

939
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:22,204
Who's first?

940
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:24,498
Trojan whore!

941
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:26,583
What's this? A virgin's robe?

942
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:29,920
- You won't be needing that for much longer!
- Hold her.

943
01:48:34,926 --> 01:48:37,803
Come on. Come on. Hold her down.

944
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:13,046
Are you hurt?

945
01:49:19,178 --> 01:49:21,471
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

946
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:26,143
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.

947
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,001
Eat.

948
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:01,678
I've known men like you my whole life.

949
01:50:03,389 --> 01:50:04,514
No, you haven't.

950
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:07,017
You think you're so different
from 1000 others?

951
01:50:07,894 --> 01:50:11,772
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.

952
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:14,357
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.

953
01:50:15,318 --> 01:50:18,028
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.

954
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:21,239
Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.

955
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:25,827
Why did you choose this life?

956
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:28,538
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.

957
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:34,795
I chose nothing. I was born,
and this is what I am.

958
01:50:36,339 --> 01:50:39,424
And you? Why did you choose
to love a god?

959
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:43,386
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

960
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:47,557
Do you enjoy provoking me?

961
01:50:49,519 --> 01:50:51,561
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

962
01:50:51,729 --> 01:50:55,398
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena,
goddess of wisdom. You serve them.

963
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,068
- Yes, of course.
- And Ares, god of war?

964
01:50:58,236 --> 01:51:01,238
Who blankets his bed with the skin
of men he's killed?

965
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:05,826
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

966
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:18,672
I'll tell you a secret...

967
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:21,925
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

968
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:34,813
The gods envy us.

969
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:38,608
They envy us because we're mortal.

970
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:42,988
Because any moment might be our last.

971
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:46,575
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

972
01:51:47,785 --> 01:51:50,745
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

973
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:56,793
We will never be here again.

974
01:52:07,555 --> 01:52:09,556
I thought you were a dumb brute.

975
01:52:13,144 --> 01:52:15,145
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

976
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:40,712
Do it.

977
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:48,803
Nothing is easier.

978
01:52:48,971 --> 01:52:50,180
Aren't you afraid?

979
01:52:52,475 --> 01:52:57,062
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years
from now. What does it matter?

980
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:03,652
Do it.

981
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,405
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

982
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:09,199
Many.

983
01:54:44,128 --> 01:54:45,628
My lord, there's-

984
01:55:00,478 --> 01:55:04,230
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

985
01:55:08,194 --> 01:55:09,986
Gather the stores.

986
01:55:10,154 --> 01:55:11,988
Prepare the ship.

987
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:14,657
Prepare the ship.

988
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,368
Agamemnon is a proud man.

989
01:55:18,454 --> 01:55:20,830
But he knows when he's made a mistake.

990
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:23,249
The man sends you
to make his apologies?

991
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:28,129
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

992
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:31,382
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

993
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:35,053
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

994
01:55:37,056 --> 01:55:39,891
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

995
01:55:40,059 --> 01:55:41,726
Are we supposed to fear him?

996
01:55:41,894 --> 01:55:46,773
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.

997
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:51,444
We need you back.

998
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,446
Greece needs you.

999
01:55:54,365 --> 01:55:57,117
Greece got along fine before I was born.

1000
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:59,536
Greece will be Greece long after I'm dead.

1001
01:55:59,703 --> 01:56:01,746
I'm not talking about the land.

1002
01:56:01,914 --> 01:56:04,165
The men need you.

1003
01:56:07,628 --> 01:56:09,212
Stay, Achilles.

1004
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:11,756
You were born for this war.

1005
01:56:15,678 --> 01:56:17,262
Things are less simple today.

1006
01:56:19,265 --> 01:56:23,560
Women have a way
of complicating things.

1007
01:56:27,273 --> 01:56:30,567
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

1008
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:32,902
But in this war, you're a servant.

1009
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:36,239
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

1010
01:56:37,867 --> 01:56:40,743
I hope you understand that one day.

1011
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:47,208
We're going home?

1012
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:53,006
We sail in the morning.

1013
01:56:53,299 --> 01:56:56,759
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

1014
01:56:56,927 --> 01:57:00,763
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

1015
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:02,348
These are our countrymen.

1016
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:06,102
I ate, laughed, mourned with these men
while you hid in your tent.

1017
01:57:07,188 --> 01:57:10,190
You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

1018
01:57:14,403 --> 01:57:16,237
Someone has to lose.

1019
01:57:17,323 --> 01:57:21,409
In all my years to come,
may my heart never turn as black as yours!

1020
01:57:21,702 --> 01:57:23,953
We sail in the morning!

1021
01:57:29,877 --> 01:57:32,295
The omens are gathering.

1022
01:57:32,463 --> 01:57:34,297
The directive is clear.

1023
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:36,716
Fight for your country,
that's the only directive.

1024
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:41,804
Last time the high priest spoke to us,
he prophesied a great victory for Troy.

1025
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:45,725
We won a great victory. Let him speak.

1026
01:57:46,352 --> 01:57:48,811
What course of action
do you recommend?

1027
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:51,481
The gods favor our cause.

1028
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:54,859
Now is the time to destroy
the Greek army.

1029
01:57:56,487 --> 01:57:57,779
Glaucus?

1030
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,949
Their morale is battered.

1031
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:04,327
Hit them now. Hit them hard.

1032
01:58:04,495 --> 01:58:06,329
And they will run.

1033
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:12,794
I must admit,
I overestimated the Greeks.

1034
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:16,214
They lack discipline and courage.

1035
01:58:23,347 --> 01:58:27,642
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday. There
must be dissension among the Greeks.

1036
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:30,436
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

1037
01:58:31,188 --> 01:58:33,189
If they decide to attack us, let them.

1038
01:58:33,357 --> 01:58:36,276
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

1039
01:58:40,406 --> 01:58:42,907
Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us.

1040
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:46,035
We should not return the favor.

1041
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,510
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

1042
01:59:02,678 --> 01:59:06,347
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

1043
01:59:06,849 --> 01:59:09,809
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

1044
01:59:10,311 --> 01:59:14,105
Two of their kings
have already gone down to the dust.

1045
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:22,071
Prepare the army. We attack at daybreak.

1046
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:23,740
Father.

1047
01:59:24,742 --> 01:59:26,701
We're making a mistake.

1048
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:30,496
Prepare the army.

1049
01:59:48,557 --> 01:59:50,141
Come on.

1050
02:00:17,795 --> 02:00:19,921
Am I still your captive?

1051
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,342
You're my guest.

1052
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:30,098
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

1053
02:00:30,265 --> 02:00:31,933
You should leave, then.

1054
02:00:38,857 --> 02:00:40,900
Would you leave this all behind?

1055
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:46,989
Would you leave Troy?

1056
02:03:47,504 --> 02:03:49,338
Hold those barricades!

1057
02:04:10,193 --> 02:04:12,153
Archers to the rear.

1058
02:04:21,538 --> 02:04:23,706
Achilles.

1059
02:04:46,855 --> 02:04:48,689
Achilles.

1060
02:04:51,568 --> 02:04:53,194
Now!

1061
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:03,746
Forward!

1062
02:07:58,129 --> 02:07:59,755
Enough for one day.

1063
02:08:01,925 --> 02:08:03,175
Yes.

1064
02:08:04,678 --> 02:08:06,178
Back to the ships!

1065
02:08:06,346 --> 02:08:08,764
Back to the ships!

1066
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,309
It was his cousin.

1067
02:08:16,690 --> 02:08:18,274
To Troy!

1068
02:08:19,192 --> 02:08:21,360
Back to the city!

1069
02:08:22,279 --> 02:08:23,654
To Troy!

1070
02:08:25,782 --> 02:08:27,950
We were going to sail home today.

1071
02:08:30,787 --> 02:08:33,455
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

1072
02:08:54,185 --> 02:08:55,644
Achilles.

1073
02:09:11,161 --> 02:09:12,995
You violated my command.

1074
02:09:13,788 --> 02:09:17,082
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

1075
02:09:18,001 --> 02:09:20,544
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

1076
02:09:20,837 --> 02:09:22,963
You led them into combat.

1077
02:09:27,844 --> 02:09:31,722
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

1078
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:40,731
Where's Patroclus?

1079
02:09:43,693 --> 02:09:45,402
Patroclus!

1080
02:09:45,862 --> 02:09:48,155
We thought he was you, my lord.

1081
02:09:50,617 --> 02:09:56,372
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

1082
02:09:57,290 --> 02:09:59,083
He even moved like you.

1083
02:09:59,876 --> 02:10:01,961
Where is he?

1084
02:10:05,757 --> 02:10:07,633
- Where?
- He's dead, my lord.

1085
02:10:08,718 --> 02:10:10,219
Hector cut his throat.

1086
02:10:21,064 --> 02:10:23,482
Don't. Don't.

1087
02:10:56,266 --> 02:10:58,017
Where are you taking me?

1088
02:11:03,815 --> 02:11:05,774
Do you remember how to get here?

1089
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:07,985
Yes.

1090
02:11:15,535 --> 02:11:18,579
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

1091
02:11:18,747 --> 02:11:21,832
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

1092
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,417
Why?

1093
02:11:23,918 --> 02:11:26,420
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

1094
02:11:26,588 --> 02:11:29,006
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

1095
02:11:29,841 --> 02:11:32,217
The Greeks won't go that far inland.

1096
02:11:33,011 --> 02:11:34,636
Hector.

1097
02:11:35,346 --> 02:11:37,014
Why are you telling me this?

1098
02:11:42,604 --> 02:11:44,063
- If I die-
- No.

1099
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:47,483
If I die, I don't know how long
the city will stand.

1100
02:11:47,901 --> 02:11:49,068
Don't say that.

1101
02:11:49,235 --> 02:11:51,487
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

1102
02:11:52,197 --> 02:11:55,616
They'll kill all the men, throw
the babies from the city walls.

1103
02:11:55,784 --> 02:11:58,160
- Please.
- The women, they'll take as slaves.

1104
02:11:58,328 --> 02:12:00,996
That, for you, will be worse than dying.

1105
02:12:01,247 --> 02:12:03,957
Why are you saying such things?

1106
02:12:06,836 --> 02:12:08,796
Because I want you to be ready.

1107
02:12:11,174 --> 02:12:15,010
I want you to get our boy,
and I want you to bring him here.

1108
02:12:16,346 --> 02:12:20,849
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here. And you run.

1109
02:12:22,519 --> 02:12:23,727
Do you understand?

1110
02:12:31,069 --> 02:12:32,820
I killed a boy today.

1111
02:12:34,739 --> 02:12:36,406
And he was young.

1112
02:12:37,575 --> 02:12:39,409
He was much too young.

1113
02:13:14,571 --> 02:13:17,406
That boy has just saved this war for us.

1114
02:15:05,056 --> 02:15:07,224
- Eudorus.
- My lord.

1115
02:15:07,392 --> 02:15:09,184
I need my armor.

1116
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:11,413
No.

1117
02:16:12,957 --> 02:16:14,291
Don't go!

1118
02:16:15,168 --> 02:16:17,085
Rope!

1119
02:16:17,253 --> 02:16:19,588
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

1120
02:16:20,173 --> 02:16:22,966
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

1121
02:16:23,384 --> 02:16:25,302
Please.

1122
02:17:41,838 --> 02:17:43,171
No.

1123
02:18:09,073 --> 02:18:11,074
Hector!

1124
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:18,999
Hector!

1125
02:18:26,924 --> 02:18:28,884
Hector!

1126
02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:35,390
Hector!

1127
02:18:39,312 --> 02:18:41,271
Father...

1128
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:43,815
...forgive me for any offenses.

1129
02:18:45,693 --> 02:18:47,944
I've served you as best as I could.

1130
02:18:48,529 --> 02:18:50,197
Hector!

1131
02:18:54,452 --> 02:18:56,870
May the gods be with you.

1132
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:02,459
Hector.

1133
02:19:05,254 --> 02:19:08,590
No father ever had a better son.

1134
02:19:15,264 --> 02:19:16,848
Hector!

1135
02:19:18,726 --> 02:19:20,352
Apollo guard you, my prince.

1136
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:29,027
You're the best man I know.

1137
02:19:35,284 --> 02:19:37,118
You're a prince of Troy.

1138
02:19:37,912 --> 02:19:39,454
I know you'll make me proud.

1139
02:19:47,255 --> 02:19:49,923
Hector!

1140
02:20:06,941 --> 02:20:09,025
Remember what I told you.

1141
02:20:09,819 --> 02:20:12,821
You don't have to go. You don't.

1142
02:20:13,114 --> 02:20:14,906
You remember what I told you.

1143
02:20:33,259 --> 02:20:35,677
Hector!

1144
02:20:51,193 --> 02:20:53,778
Hector!

1145
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:10,438
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

1146
02:22:12,608 --> 02:22:13,983
I'll make a pact with you.

1147
02:22:14,944 --> 02:22:16,986
With the gods as our witnesses...

1148
02:22:17,154 --> 02:22:21,866
...let us pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

1149
02:22:22,034 --> 02:22:25,036
There are no pacts
between lions and men.

1150
02:22:33,045 --> 02:22:35,338
Now you know who you're fighting.

1151
02:22:43,848 --> 02:22:46,683
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

1152
02:22:47,017 --> 02:22:51,020
And I wish it had been you. But I gave
the dead boy the honor he deserved.

1153
02:22:51,188 --> 02:22:53,189
You gave him the honor of your sword.

1154
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:57,068
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

1155
02:22:57,236 --> 02:23:01,448
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf,
and dumb, and all the dead will know:

1156
02:23:01,615 --> 02:23:05,326
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

1157
02:25:03,404 --> 02:25:04,696
Get up, prince of Troy.

1158
02:25:07,324 --> 02:25:10,285
Get up. I won't let a stone take my glory.

1159
02:28:43,123 --> 02:28:44,999
You lost your cousin.

1160
02:28:46,835 --> 02:28:48,669
Now you've taken mine.

1161
02:28:52,132 --> 02:28:53,716
When does it end?

1162
02:28:55,761 --> 02:28:57,303
It never ends.

1163
02:29:57,239 --> 02:29:58,781
Who are you?

1164
02:29:58,949 --> 02:30:04,829
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

1165
02:30:05,497 --> 02:30:10,793
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

1166
02:30:17,926 --> 02:30:19,594
Priam?

1167
02:30:21,138 --> 02:30:22,513
How did you get in here?

1168
02:30:22,681 --> 02:30:26,642
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

1169
02:30:31,398 --> 02:30:33,816
You're a brave man.

1170
02:30:36,612 --> 02:30:39,780
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

1171
02:30:40,157 --> 02:30:43,951
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

1172
02:30:45,704 --> 02:30:48,289
I watched my eldest son die...

1173
02:30:48,457 --> 02:30:52,335
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

1174
02:30:55,547 --> 02:30:57,715
Give him back to me.

1175
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:03,304
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

1176
02:31:04,264 --> 02:31:06,474
Give him to me.

1177
02:31:07,392 --> 02:31:09,101
He killed my cousin.

1178
02:31:09,269 --> 02:31:11,229
He thought it was you.

1179
02:31:13,815 --> 02:31:16,525
How many cousins have you killed?

1180
02:31:18,070 --> 02:31:21,989
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

1181
02:31:22,199 --> 02:31:24,784
How many, brave Achilles?

1182
02:31:29,665 --> 02:31:31,791
I knew your father.

1183
02:31:32,918 --> 02:31:35,211
He died before his time.

1184
02:31:36,505 --> 02:31:41,676
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

1185
02:31:46,598 --> 02:31:49,267
You have taken everything from me.

1186
02:31:51,353 --> 02:31:53,187
My eldest son...

1187
02:31:53,814 --> 02:31:55,606
...heir to my throne...

1188
02:31:56,024 --> 02:31:58,651
...defender of my kingdom.

1189
02:32:00,028 --> 02:32:04,699
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

1190
02:32:05,993 --> 02:32:09,328
But give me this small mercy.

1191
02:32:11,665 --> 02:32:15,793
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

1192
02:32:15,961 --> 02:32:18,796
...till the moment you closed them.

1193
02:32:21,216 --> 02:32:24,218
Let me wash his body.

1194
02:32:25,846 --> 02:32:29,056
Let me say the prayers.

1195
02:32:30,350 --> 02:32:35,396
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

1196
02:32:40,110 --> 02:32:42,361
If I let you walk out of here...

1197
02:32:44,656 --> 02:32:46,574
...if I let you take him...

1198
02:32:49,244 --> 02:32:51,287
...it doesn't change anything.

1199
02:32:52,873 --> 02:32:55,541
You're still my enemy in the morning.

1200
02:32:56,668 --> 02:32:59,712
You're still my enemy tonight.

1201
02:33:00,756 --> 02:33:04,342
But even enemies can show respect.

1202
02:33:24,029 --> 02:33:25,446
I admire your courage.

1203
02:33:33,163 --> 02:33:34,955
Meet me outside in a moment.

1204
02:34:21,002 --> 02:34:22,711
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

1205
02:34:57,372 --> 02:34:59,790
Your son was the best I've fought.

1206
02:35:03,044 --> 02:35:05,713
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

1207
02:35:06,214 --> 02:35:08,340
It is the same in my country.

1208
02:35:09,092 --> 02:35:11,260
Then the prince will have that honor.

1209
02:35:12,137 --> 02:35:15,431
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

1210
02:35:21,563 --> 02:35:22,897
Briseis?

1211
02:35:26,026 --> 02:35:28,402
I thought you were dead.

1212
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:40,372
You are free.

1213
02:35:56,806 --> 02:35:58,516
If I hurt you...

1214
02:36:00,894 --> 02:36:03,103
...it's not what I wanted.

1215
02:36:17,619 --> 02:36:18,911
Go.

1216
02:36:19,329 --> 02:36:22,498
No one will stop you. You have my word.

1217
02:36:23,291 --> 02:36:24,959
Come, my girl.

1218
02:36:32,133 --> 02:36:35,844
You're a far better king than the one
leading this army.

1219
02:36:52,362 --> 02:36:56,323
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I
have to honor it? What treason is this?

1220
02:36:56,741 --> 02:37:00,744
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

1221
02:37:00,912 --> 02:37:03,038
Peace! Peace!

1222
02:37:03,331 --> 02:37:06,041
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

1223
02:37:06,209 --> 02:37:07,835
This is the time to attack!

1224
02:37:08,169 --> 02:37:12,339
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

1225
02:37:12,924 --> 02:37:15,342
They can wait 10 years for us to leave.

1226
02:37:16,595 --> 02:37:19,305
I will smash their walls to the ground...

1227
02:37:19,472 --> 02:37:22,057
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

1228
02:37:22,225 --> 02:37:24,852
Hear me, Zeus!

1229
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:28,731
I will smash their walls to the ground.

1230
02:39:16,047 --> 02:39:17,464
That's good.

1231
02:39:17,841 --> 02:39:19,758
For my son back home.

1232
02:39:46,619 --> 02:39:48,162
Well, Odysseus.

1233
02:39:49,164 --> 02:39:53,834
You found a way to make the sheep
invite the wolves to dinner.

1234
02:40:12,228 --> 02:40:15,939
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

1235
02:40:18,234 --> 02:40:21,361
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

1236
02:40:24,532 --> 02:40:27,201
I hope I never disappoint you again.

1237
02:40:27,535 --> 02:40:30,037
It's I who have been the disappointment.

1238
02:40:33,541 --> 02:40:36,210
Rouse the men. You're taking them home.

1239
02:40:38,546 --> 02:40:40,380
Aren't you coming with us?

1240
02:40:41,174 --> 02:40:43,383
I have my own battle to fight.

1241
02:40:43,885 --> 02:40:45,552
Let me march beside you.

1242
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:49,556
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

1243
02:40:55,647 --> 02:40:57,481
It's a beautiful night.

1244
02:40:58,149 --> 02:41:01,443
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

1245
02:41:07,408 --> 02:41:10,577
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

1246
02:41:24,259 --> 02:41:26,969
Open the gates!
Open the gates!

1247
02:41:41,109 --> 02:41:42,776
Here.

1248
02:42:09,137 --> 02:42:10,804
Plague.

1249
02:42:11,472 --> 02:42:14,099
Don't go too close, my king.

1250
02:42:14,851 --> 02:42:17,102
This is the will of the gods.

1251
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:19,187
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

1252
02:42:19,731 --> 02:42:22,232
...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

1253
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:26,320
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

1254
02:42:26,487 --> 02:42:30,324
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

1255
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:35,662
What is this?

1256
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:40,542
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks
are praying for a safe return home.

1257
02:42:40,710 --> 02:42:43,587
I hope the sea god spits in their offering.

1258
02:42:43,755 --> 02:42:46,423
Lets them all drown
at the bottom of the sea.

1259
02:42:46,591 --> 02:42:50,469
This is a gift. We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

1260
02:42:51,512 --> 02:42:53,513
- I think we should burn it.
- Burn it?

1261
02:42:53,681 --> 02:42:55,515
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

1262
02:42:55,808 --> 02:42:58,018
The prince is right.

1263
02:42:58,186 --> 02:43:01,730
I would burn the whole of Greece
if I had a big enough torch.

1264
02:43:01,898 --> 02:43:05,609
I warn you, good men,
be careful what you insult.

1265
02:43:06,194 --> 02:43:10,364
Our beloved Prince Hector
had sharp words for the gods...

1266
02:43:10,531 --> 02:43:13,659
...and a day later
Achilles' sword cut him down.

1267
02:43:13,826 --> 02:43:16,370
Father, burn it.

1268
02:43:17,163 --> 02:43:20,082
Forgive me, my king,
I mean no disrespect...

1269
02:43:20,249 --> 02:43:23,001
...but I don't want to see
any more sons of Troy...

1270
02:43:23,169 --> 02:43:25,712
...incur the gods' wrath.

1271
02:43:27,715 --> 02:43:31,426
I will not watch another son die.

1272
02:44:42,957 --> 02:44:44,499
Look at them.

1273
02:44:46,335 --> 02:44:48,795
You'd think their prince had never died.

1274
02:44:50,965 --> 02:44:53,050
You are their prince now.

1275
02:44:53,801 --> 02:44:55,844
Make your brother proud.

1276
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:52,492
Let it burn! Let Troy burn!

1277
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:57,205
Burn it! For Menelaus! Burn it!

1278
02:50:57,456 --> 02:51:02,293
Burn Troy! Burn Troy!

1279
02:51:02,461 --> 02:51:06,089
I promised you, brother!
I promised you!

1280
02:51:06,257 --> 02:51:09,634
Burn it! Burn it for Menelaus!

1281
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:55,972
Briseis. Where is she?

1282
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:58,391
- Where?
- I don't know.

1283
02:51:58,559 --> 02:52:00,393
Please. I have a son.

1284
02:52:00,769 --> 02:52:03,229
Then get him out of Troy.

1285
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:11,154
Briseis!

1286
02:52:15,326 --> 02:52:18,411
Paris! Andromache!

1287
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:21,664
Helen. We must go.

1288
02:52:21,832 --> 02:52:23,833
- Where?
- I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

1289
02:52:24,001 --> 02:52:25,418
Paris. Paris.

1290
02:52:25,586 --> 02:52:28,296
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

1291
02:52:28,464 --> 02:52:30,089
Briseis!

1292
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:35,053
Paris!

1293
02:52:41,769 --> 02:52:43,102
It's a long way. Quick.

1294
02:52:43,270 --> 02:52:45,605
Hurry. There's a tunnel.

1295
02:52:47,816 --> 02:52:49,400
- Come.
- I stay.

1296
02:52:49,568 --> 02:52:51,819
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.

1297
02:52:51,987 --> 02:52:53,071
I can't leave him.

1298
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:56,783
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

1299
02:52:58,827 --> 02:53:00,787
- What's your name?
- Aeneas.

1300
02:53:00,955 --> 02:53:03,957
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.

1301
02:53:04,124 --> 02:53:06,084
The sword of Troy.

1302
02:53:06,252 --> 02:53:09,796
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

1303
02:53:09,964 --> 02:53:12,507
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.

1304
02:53:12,758 --> 02:53:15,134
- I will.
- Hurry. Quick.

1305
02:53:15,302 --> 02:53:17,720
Paris, Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

1306
02:53:17,888 --> 02:53:19,389
I'll find her.

1307
02:53:21,809 --> 02:53:23,476
Go.

1308
02:53:24,311 --> 02:53:26,020
- I'll stay with you.
- Go.

1309
02:53:26,188 --> 02:53:27,397
Please don't leave me.

1310
02:53:27,565 --> 02:53:29,732
- How could you love me if I ran now?
- Please.

1311
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:34,195
We will be together again, in this world
or the next. We will be together.

1312
02:53:40,995 --> 02:53:42,620
Go.

1313
02:53:46,208 --> 02:53:48,376
To the gate!

1314
02:53:48,669 --> 02:53:50,378
Forward!

1315
02:54:07,980 --> 02:54:09,522
Follow me!

1316
02:54:11,775 --> 02:54:13,109
Into line!

1317
02:54:15,112 --> 02:54:17,113
Soldiers of Troy...

1318
02:54:17,406 --> 02:54:19,699
...you men are warriors!

1319
02:54:19,867 --> 02:54:22,535
To lead you has been my honor!

1320
02:54:23,996 --> 02:54:25,538
My prince!

1321
02:54:27,249 --> 02:54:29,208
The boatman waits for us.

1322
02:54:29,460 --> 02:54:33,838
I say we make him wait a little longer!

1323
02:54:56,278 --> 02:54:59,447
No one. Spare no one.

1324
02:55:09,917 --> 02:55:11,292
Paris!

1325
02:55:12,086 --> 02:55:14,045
Save yourself.

1326
02:55:44,785 --> 02:55:46,077
Briseis!

1327
02:56:09,017 --> 02:56:12,770
Beware, my friends.
I am a servant of the gods.

1328
02:56:37,713 --> 02:56:40,631
Have you no honor?

1329
02:56:40,799 --> 02:56:42,508
Have you no honor?

1330
02:56:56,607 --> 02:56:59,692
I wanted you alive, old man.

1331
02:57:00,152 --> 02:57:03,070
I wanted you to watch your city burn.

1332
02:57:05,032 --> 02:57:06,824
Please.

1333
02:57:08,202 --> 02:57:10,328
The children.

1334
02:57:12,664 --> 02:57:16,667
Spare the innocents.

1335
02:57:17,419 --> 02:57:19,295
Nobody's innocent.

1336
02:57:20,088 --> 02:57:21,881
Nobody.

1337
02:57:41,902 --> 02:57:44,403
Too late for prayer, priestess.

1338
02:57:53,664 --> 02:57:57,291
I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.

1339
02:57:58,752 --> 02:58:03,130
I want to taste what Achilles tasted.

1340
02:58:18,105 --> 02:58:22,525
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.

1341
02:58:22,693 --> 02:58:28,197
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.

1342
02:58:30,117 --> 02:58:31,450
And at night...

1343
02:58:45,048 --> 02:58:46,716
Get up!

1344
02:58:49,761 --> 02:58:51,637
Hold her.

1345
02:59:00,022 --> 02:59:01,355
Come with me.

1346
02:59:05,068 --> 02:59:06,611
No!

1347
02:59:14,161 --> 02:59:17,288
Paris!

1348
02:59:22,127 --> 02:59:23,669
No!

1349
02:59:23,837 --> 02:59:25,379
Don't!

1350
02:59:36,934 --> 02:59:39,852
Don't! Please!

1351
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:47,735
Paris! Don't!

1352
03:00:20,644 --> 03:00:22,061
It's all right.

1353
03:00:23,021 --> 03:00:24,897
It's all right.

1354
03:00:48,005 --> 03:00:49,922
You gave me peace...

1355
03:00:51,758 --> 03:00:53,801
...in a lifetime of war.

1356
03:00:59,099 --> 03:01:00,433
Briseis, come.

1357
03:01:04,771 --> 03:01:06,022
- Go.
- No.

1358
03:01:06,189 --> 03:01:07,440
You must.

1359
03:01:07,607 --> 03:01:09,108
No.

1360
03:01:09,443 --> 03:01:11,110
Troy is falling.

1361
03:01:11,945 --> 03:01:14,321
- Go.
- No.

1362
03:01:14,489 --> 03:01:16,032
Begin anew.

1363
03:01:17,617 --> 03:01:20,870
We must go. I know a way out.

1364
03:01:27,669 --> 03:01:29,003
It's all right.

1365
03:01:31,506 --> 03:01:33,215
Go.

1366
03:01:40,891 --> 03:01:42,183
Go.

1367
03:03:22,409 --> 03:03:24,034
Find peace...

1368
03:03:24,995 --> 03:03:26,495
...my brother.

1369
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:41,904
<i>If they ever tell my story, let them say...</i>

1370
03:04:42,072 --> 03:04:44,573
<i>...I walked with giants.</i>

1371
03:04:45,242 --> 03:04:48,702
<i>Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...</i>

1372
03:04:48,912 --> 03:04:51,497
<i>...but these names will never die.</i>

1373
03:04:53,416 --> 03:04:56,919
<i>Let them say I lived
in the time of Hector...</i>

1374
03:04:57,087 --> 03:04:59,338
<i>...breaker of horses.</i>

1375
03:04:59,756 --> 03:05:01,674
<i>Let them say...</i>

1376
03:05:01,841 --> 03:05:05,511
<i>...I lived in the time of Achilles.</i>
