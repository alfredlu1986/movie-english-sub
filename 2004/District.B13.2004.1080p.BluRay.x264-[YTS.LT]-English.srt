1
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,380
Paris, 2010.

2
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:20,611
Faced with rampant crime...

3
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:22,813
in certain suburbs,
or barrios...

4
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,082
the government authorized...

5
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:26,249
the construction
of an isolation wall...

6
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:29,123
around cities classified
as high risk.

7
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,621
Come on. Let's go.
I'm starving.

8
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:10,889
They ain't ready yet.

9
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,159
OK, they're ready.
Help yourself. Go on.

10
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:03,214
I must have an effect
on you fags, huh?

11
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:04,476
I step out of my car...

12
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,608
and you already have the trap.

13
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:07,276
We don't want no shit here, K2.

14
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,684
What are you talking about?

15
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:09,778
It's just a friendly visit.

16
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,220
That's all it is.

17
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,985
Ah, smells good here, too.

18
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,650
Americans?

19
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,556
Delicious.

20
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:25,062
Want some?

21
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:30,170
So... is the boss around?

22
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,436
We ain't seen him today.

23
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,410
That's OK.
I don't mind waiting.

24
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,912
Come on. Relax.

25
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,345
Go on. Search me.
I ain't armed.

26
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:37,609
Clean as a choirboy.

27
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:38,809
Look, we don't
want to shoot.

28
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,044
You better go back.

29
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,609
What's with you guys?

30
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,416
We're stuck in zones.
We can't communicate.

31
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,582
For once we're together,
and you get nervous and shy.

32
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:46,749
We don't feel like talking...

33
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,520
so get moving, will ya?

34
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,255
The boss ain't here,
and we told ya.

35
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,422
If you want, we'll tell him you were here.

36
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,261
It's really nice of you.

37
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,664
Anyone got a piece of paper?

38
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,861
I'll leave him a number
where he can reach me.

39
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,962
No? I'll write it on the wall.

40
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,132
Won't get lost that way.

41
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:03,572
Nothing on the wall.

42
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:05,974
I forgot, this is Mr. Clean's
apartment building.

43
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,036
Real fancy guy
your boss is, huh?

44
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:10,081
Yeah. It hurts you
to see a building's...

45
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,673
still standing in this
shithouse of a city.

46
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,377
Well, me, I think it's great.

47
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:15,613
Makes the city more lively.

48
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,655
So, where do I write the number?

49
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,393
Gimme your hand.

50
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,654
Gimme your hand, I said.

51
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:23,854
If I was going to cut ya...

52
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,328
I'd have done it
a long time ago.

53
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:26,625
Look at him.
Armed to the teeth...

54
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,359
and he's scared of a pen.

55
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,095
OK. Don't worry, man.

56
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,636
I'm not going
to press hard.

57
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,762
Why do you want to see Leito?

58
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,966
He's got some stuff I want.

59
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,736
Things that belong to me.

60
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,310
There we go.

61
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,615
Now you got a good reason
not to wash.

62
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:49,881
That was a nice,
friendly visit...

63
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,445
don't you think so?

64
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,115
Why don't we shake on it, huh?

65
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,352
What's your name?

66
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:56,656
- Tarik.
- Tarik. Let's shake.

67
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,787
That's better.
Don't be afraid.

68
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,764
Ah, this is worth a picture.

69
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,095
I wish I had my camera.

70
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,759
- Right, guys?
- Smile. Come on.

71
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,702
It's OK.
They're with me.

72
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,284
Oh? So you feel like talking
all of a sudden?

73
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,842
But it's too late.

74
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,928
You go up the stairs.
I'll take the elevator.

75
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,363
For once, it's not broken.

76
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,762
Hey.

77
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,369
Yeah.

78
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,891
Call downstairs.
The elevator's coming.

79
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,060
You could do it
yourself, you know.

80
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,338
Tarik, who's coming up?

81
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,671
Tarik? Fucking thing
never works right.

82
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,242
Hey, move it, man.
We got visitors.

83
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,405
Look, if I don't
watch the end...

84
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,278
I won't be able
to follow tomorrow.

85
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,283
Tarik, would you say something?

86
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:28,842
Tarik?

87
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,188
- Tarik?
- Shit, the picture's gone.

88
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,588
Hurry. Fix the antenna.

89
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,751
Hey, I ain't your nigger.

90
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,350
You do it, man.

91
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:39,787
Tarik, will you answer me?

92
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:47,997
You're too worked up, man.

93
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,700
It's probably the food
being delivered.

94
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,367
That's bullshit.
Since when do they...

95
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,535
deliver an hour early, huh?

96
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,101
You're such a pessimist.

97
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,786
Leito's apartment.

98
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,485
You wouldn't know
the number, huh?

99
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,891
It's 14.

100
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,429
Thanks.

101
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,010
Son of a bitch.

102
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,175
There ain't no numbers
on the doors.

103
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,809
Get 'em all open.

104
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm looking for Leito.

105
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:48,321
It's not here.
I swear.

106
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,027
Then tell me
where it is, asshole.

107
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,069
Down the hall and left.

108
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,330
He's got his name on the door.

109
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,598
You're coming with me.

110
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,139
I don't trust signs.
Come on.

111
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,507
Go right!

112
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,050
Left!

113
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,682
Through the door!

114
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:20,531
Whoa! What are you trying to do?

115
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,931
Get me killed?
Alive, remember.

116
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,332
Taha wants 'em alive.

117
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:28,871
Move.

118
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,710
On three.

119
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,578
One, two...

120
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,947
Get the bastard!

121
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,502
Get it open.

122
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,132
Oh, no!

123
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,579
Come on! Move!

124
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:40,435
The roof! Hurry!

125
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,943
Stupid fuck.

126
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,048
There he is!

127
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,026
Fucking...

128
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,996
Stop me if I'm wrong.

129
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,158
At 8:00, you get ripped off.

130
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,724
Twenty kilos of powder.

131
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:45,394
At 9:00, you know who did it
and you go get it back.

132
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,665
- How many were you?
- Ten, twelve.

133
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,001
Ten, twelve, huh?

134
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,167
At about noon, seven of you
come back empty-handed.

135
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,835
Anything else?

136
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,538
Well, we could've iced the guy...

137
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,671
but you wanted him alive, sir.

138
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,941
Well, that's fantastic.
Before long...

139
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,175
it'll be my fault.

140
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,444
Oh, that's not
what I wanted to say.

141
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,681
He's like, uh... like a bar of soap. He's...

142
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,085
Ah, is that so?

143
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:06,316
Well, yeah.

144
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,188
Let's see... fifty a gram, twenty kilos.

145
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,490
Don't bother counting.
It's a million.

146
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:12,120
In Euros.

147
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,960
That's very expensive soap, huh?

148
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:19,065
So. Which one of you
has a suggestion for me...

149
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,628
so he doesn't slip away again?

150
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,946
Wait! I... I got an idea.

151
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,214
Ah, K2.
That's great.

152
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,721
Go on.

153
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,656
Well, since it was Leito
who dumped all the dope...

154
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,386
then he's got to give us
the cash for it.

155
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,291
That's just common sense.
I asked you for an idea.

156
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,159
- Wait! Hold on.
- Go on.

157
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,926
His sister Lola.

158
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,628
Leito's sister works
at the supermarket.

159
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:52,829
If we've got her...

160
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,804
he won't stay
in hiding for long.

161
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,572
That's what I call an idea.

162
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,405
Go and get her.

163
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,819
We'll be right out.

164
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,537
Come on.
Boss wants to see you.

165
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,813
The boss is waiting, I said,
you heard, so get off your ass.

166
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,109
He never comes in on Tuesday.

167
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,810
I'm not talking
about that scumbag.

168
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,943
I mean my boss and yours... Taha.

169
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,715
Taha can go fuck himself.

170
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,760
What the fuck is wrong
with everyone today?

171
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,584
Get in there.

172
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:05,231
Hey, K2.
Is she me birthday present?

173
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,463
Well, I'd love a piece of her.

174
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,768
She looks just my size.

175
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,171
- Fuck off.
- Watch your hands.

176
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,833
Hey, we got to search her, huh?

177
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,377
We already did.
She's clean.

178
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,777
Come on. Share the wealth.
Leave us her panties.

179
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,075
When I come back,
I'll bite your balls off.

180
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,547
I got other plans
for your mouth.

181
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,481
You'll like it a lot more, huh?

182
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,247
That's for openers, slimeball.

183
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,279
Hands off her.
I said she's with Taha.

184
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,756
And you cut that shit out, OK?

185
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,428
It's me.

186
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,669
As you can see,
it's a real bargain.

187
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,802
It's simple to use and erotic...

188
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,869
K2 is here.

189
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,278
You can't beat it.

190
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,014
I know your face.
Show me the girl.

191
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,879
OK. Bring her up here.

192
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,583
Make sure he knows
we got his sister.

193
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,181
Spread the news.

194
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,286
Say, I wish I could see
the cocksucker...

195
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,488
when they tell him
what happened.

196
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,693
You're not gonna ever know...

197
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,394
you son of a bitch.

198
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:12,231
Why don't I cut you open now...
and that'll be the end of it?

199
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,793
Cut me and there's
a pack of wild dogs...

200
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,100
that are going to be
without a master...

201
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:16,606
and they might not be too cool.

202
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:17,766
What are you after?

203
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:18,774
You see, Taha,
that's the difference...

204
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:19,775
between the two of us.

205
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:20,936
You never know
what's in my head...

206
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,946
but I know all the shit
that's going on in yours.

207
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,276
I'm always one step
ahead of you...

208
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,475
because I know
what you're thinking.

209
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,348
Hold it, K2.
It's OK.

210
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,217
Stay nice and calm.
We're just talking.

211
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,313
Yeah. Just talking.

212
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,187
Look, tell me
what the fuck you want...

213
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,318
and stop busting my balls
and let's get this over with.

214
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,986
Two things.

215
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:39,154
Yeah? Go on.

216
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,322
You leave my building alone.

217
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,025
No dealer for
500 meters around it.

218
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,565
Yeah. OK.
What else?

219
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,969
That's easy.
Your life for my sister's.

220
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,171
I let you go,
I walk outside with her...

221
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,675
and if none of you guys move,
we got a deal.

222
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,211
You know you should've
gone into business?

223
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,303
Yes or no?

224
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,540
OK. It's a deal.

225
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:57,876
I got your word?

226
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:59,576
She ain't enough for you?

227
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,777
Give the order.

228
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,319
Yeah, K2, let her go.
You heard me?

229
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,014
Wait downstairs.

230
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,555
K2, you stop
your fuckin' thinking...

231
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,023
and do what I'm telling you to do.

232
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,753
Get down now,
or you'll never get up again.

233
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:19,066
Look. I kept my word.
She's free...

234
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,195
so now let go of me.

235
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,363
Patience, Taha.

236
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,710
You think you're going
to get out of here in one piece?

237
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,371
You think everyone here's
your buddy?

238
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,982
Listen. I got a deal
with this guy, OK?

239
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,350
I said that he
and his sister could go...

240
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,547
and so make sure nobody moves...

241
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,884
and everything'll be cool.

242
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:53,763
Hey, you.

243
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,208
Open your mouth.

244
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,114
Chew it, pig.

245
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,617
She's my kind of girl.

246
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,489
You can't have her.
Go on.

247
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,672
Let's go!
Move it! Let's go!

248
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,508
Get out of the way!
Come on! Move it!

249
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,236
This way! Faster!

250
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,715
Let's get out of here.

251
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,276
- Over here.
- Come on, man.

252
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,514
Right.

253
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:20,386
Hey, get that...
rid of that fucking thing. Hurry.

254
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,550
Come on. Move it!

255
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,457
Stop your vehicle.

256
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:28,999
Stop your vehicle!

257
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:34,030
OK, hold it. Take it easy.

258
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,402
We brought you a customer.

259
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,674
We want the inspector!

260
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,576
Make way for us.
We're coming in.

261
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,502
Son of a bitch.

262
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,902
Hey, can't you settle
your score someplace else?

263
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,200
'Cause we're closing up here.

264
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:10,968
It's Taha.
Taha Ben-Mahmoud.

265
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,236
Doesn't that name
mean something to you?

266
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,368
I know him, but I told you.

267
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,503
We're closing up by orders
of the government.

268
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,741
So if you can't show me
some proof, I can't do anything.

269
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,485
Five kilos of heroin...

270
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,417
taken from his desk
with two witnesses.

271
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,455
How's that?

272
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,897
There are too many
of them outside.

273
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:41,131
Grab them.

274
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,697
OK, OK.
Since you insist.

275
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,368
But first, your weapons.
Hand 'em over.

276
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,309
And you, men,
keep your eye on Taha.

277
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:49,710
Poor, naive Leito.

278
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,873
I bet you really think...

279
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,210
it's going to change something, don't you?

280
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,251
Maybe not much,
but you got to start somewhere.

281
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,654
Now we're going to eliminate
the paperwork, OK?

282
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,053
You go into the cell...

283
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,420
and you pick up
your dope and clear out.

284
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,322
Don't do that,
for Christ's sake.

285
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,826
If you let him go,
it'll be worse than before.

286
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,294
It won't be worse,
'cause we're getting out.

287
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:06,796
When the shit falls,
we'll be far away.

288
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,729
You won't be here,
but it's still going to go on...

289
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,631
and you're the ones
who are supposed to stop it.

290
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,929
I'll bet that you
still believe that.

291
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,301
The barbed wire and the walls.
Did you forget all that?

292
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,361
They're going to put
a lid on it...

293
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,566
and blow it all up.

294
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,438
That's what they'll do
to make the shit disappear.

295
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,737
As for you,
be grateful you're here...

296
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,903
because there are
some guys outside...

297
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,946
ready to make
dead meat out of you.

298
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,345
Why the hell are you still here?

299
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:25,712
Like you said, there are
a lot of guys out there...

300
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,080
who are ready to do
what I tell 'em to.

301
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,378
Stop that shit, Taha.

302
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,546
You're free.
You've got your dope.

303
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,748
What the hell more do you want?

304
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,916
The bitch.

305
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,856
No!

306
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,087
No!

307
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:40,255
Now get out.

308
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,764
No!

309
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm warning you.
Touch me and you're...

310
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,225
Lola! Lola!

311
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,431
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

312
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:51,335
Gentlemen,
it's always a pleasure...

313
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,377
to do business with you.

314
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:54,968
So long.

315
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:57,640
No! No!

316
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:10,257
Take her to my office,
tie her up...

317
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,488
and give her two grams.

318
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:12,859
That'll calm her down.

319
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,264
OK, OK.
Let's get back to work now.

320
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,207
I didn't have any choice, kid...

321
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,244
I've been in this area
for fifteen years.

322
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:30,839
I'm retired as of tonight...

323
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,246
and I'd like
to take advantage of it.

324
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,918
It was her or me.

325
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:37,054
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,757
You should've chosen my sister.
You're already dead.

327
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,377
Digame, Pedro, huh?

328
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:01,536
What you got against my car?

329
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:02,704
My name's not Pedro.

330
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,213
Who gives a fuck
your name's not Pedro?

331
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,216
I'm talking about
my car, <i>cojone.</i>

332
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,444
What if I crashed your head...

333
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:10,180
every time I wanted you
to keep quiet?

334
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:12,188
Hey, it's only a car.

335
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:13,917
No, it's not only a car.

336
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,822
It's my car, <i>maricón.</i>

337
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:18,225
I just had it overhauled
and it cost me a fortune.

338
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,388
So I suggest you show...

339
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,294
some fucking respect
for my car...

340
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:24,232
or you'll find yourself
under the wheels.

341
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,564
<i>Comprende?</i>

342
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:27,194
Forget it, Carlos.
He didn't do it on purpose.

343
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,363
- Come on.
- What the fuck's...

344
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,066
the matter with that guy, huh?

345
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,233
I'm sick of these kids.

346
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,742
They don't respect anything.

347
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,778
Anybody can close a door
without slamming it.

348
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:36,107
It's OK.
He's going to take...

349
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,442
good care of your car
from now on.

350
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,710
- Right, Pedro?
- My name is not Pedro.

351
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,911
Once more,
that door's got a squeak.

352
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:43,248
The garage takes a fortune...

353
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,017
and gives me back the car
with a squeaky fucking door.

354
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,853
I'll get rid of
the squeaking, Carlos.

355
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,222
I-I promise you.

356
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,856
We got to recruit better, Benito.

357
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,056
It's getting bad.

358
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:55,689
Remind me to talk to Frank.

359
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,256
- OK.
- Tired of getting all these...

360
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,633
Portuguese guys.
Soldiers today.

361
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,966
<i>Campesinos.</i>

362
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,630
I'll talk to Frank
about it. Don't worry.

363
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,870
I want men with
an education, damn it.

364
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:08,776
Hire good prospects as soon
as they get out of school.

365
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,108
Guys who want
to use their brains...

366
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:11,705
instead of hanging out all day.

367
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:14,546
Benito, there are
six million unemployed...

368
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,881
in this fucking country.

369
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,217
Two or three shouldn't be
so fucking hard to find, huh?

370
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,951
Yeah. Frank'll get us
some good men, that's for sure.

371
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,652
Well, what are you staring at?

372
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:26,227
There we go.

373
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,937
Place your bets.

374
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,310
- Twenty-seven.
- Don't forget me, Carlos.

375
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,081
Hey, no problem, Yeti.

376
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,416
I know you won't.

377
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,286
End of the week, as usual, huh?

378
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:55,917
Hey, <i>puta...</i>

379
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:58,257
<i>cojones...</i>

380
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,626
reminded me about a kickback...

381
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:00,891
with all the money he owes us.

382
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:04,594
No education nowadays,
huh, Benito?

383
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,631
Downstairs.

384
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,202
<i>Hola, ¿qué tal?</i>

385
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:19,075
Everything's OK, Samy?

386
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,481
No. Things are pretty terrible.

387
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,678
Oh, yeah. What's wrong now?

388
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:25,911
Everyone you see is a cop?

389
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,218
One there. Two there.

390
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,553
They've already spent an hour...

391
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:30,093
chasing a can of corn.

392
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,093
Ah. They're perverts.

393
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,254
Perverts?
What are they doing...

394
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,422
in the food section?

395
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,226
Nada. They're just waiting
for 2 A.M...

396
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,096
when the hookers use
the coffee machine there. See?

397
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:39,528
You got here at 1:10...

398
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:42,697
and outside,
look what's happening now.

399
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,274
- What's that?
- Perverts...

400
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,641
and I don't think
they're going to spend...

401
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,009
hours looking for corn.

402
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,377
Anything else suspicious?

403
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,506
Yeah. Most of
our regular players...

404
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:52,674
didn't show up tonight.

405
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,240
It just happens
to be the one day...

406
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:55,615
we transfer our money.

407
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:57,176
Yeah? So you're saying?

408
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,688
That a real big transfer
can be very tempting.

409
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:01,748
All you have to do
is put the cops onto the deal...

410
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,418
and you get ten percent
of the money with no risk.

411
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:04,756
How do you know that, anyway?

412
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,296
'Cause I've already
been offered it.

413
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,456
You must have been tempted.

414
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:08,623
How can you be sure...

415
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,927
it was a real cop
who approached you?

416
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,628
Uh-huh.
You're pretty clever, huh?

417
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,227
It's the only way to stay alive.

418
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,500
That's for sure.
You went to school, right?

419
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,269
Economics.
Bachelor's degree.

420
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:21,436
Yeah, I was right.
You see the difference, huh?

421
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:27,045
So, somebody's trying
to rob us, huh?

422
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,344
And rob us big time, too.

423
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,426
Didn't I tell you that Pedro guy
was pretty fuckin' weird?

424
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,733
- He and the <i>puta.</i>
<i>- His name wasn't...</i>

425
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:48,897
Oh, who cares what his name was?

426
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,406
I ain't putting up
any monument, huh?

427
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,772
OK. Grab the money.
Let's go.

428
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:55,573
No one's going anywhere.
Sacks down, hands up, huh?

429
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:56,670
Benito, what are you doing?

430
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:59,272
I'm not Benito anymore.
The name's Damien.

431
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,977
First attack division.
Carlos Montoya...

432
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,678
you are under arrest.
Get it?

433
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,152
Benito, you gotta be...

434
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,416
You have the right
to remain silent.

435
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,583
Whatever you say
can be used against you.

436
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,149
Any threatening gesture
or false movement...

437
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,819
will be considered as
a refusal to cooperate...

438
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,988
thus putting my agents...

439
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,894
in a position of self-defense. Clear?

440
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,227
What does all that shit mean?

441
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,426
It means one false move...

442
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,934
and I'll paint
the place red. <i>Capito?</i>

443
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:20,470
Yeah, yeah.
And how do you think...

444
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,005
you're going to get
out of here in one piece?

445
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,336
We're going to stick
around here some more.

446
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:26,433
Samy, you and your friends,
clear out.

447
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,350
Why the hell
did you let them go?

448
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,515
Because you're the big one.

449
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:43,719
Chameleon in place.
Are you guys all set?

450
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:45,659
We are, Chameleon.
Here it comes.

451
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:52,065
What do we do now?

452
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:54,331
- What are you asking me for?
- You went to school.

453
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,497
Come on. Enough of that.

454
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,209
What's going on?

455
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,714
You OK?
Nothing broken?

456
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,588
- No, no. I'm OK.
- Good.

457
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,163
Chameleon to carrier.
The delivery's ready.

458
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,667
Commencing operation.

459
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,131
OK. Come on out of there, sir, please.

460
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,651
What now, Einstein?

461
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,263
Hurry up!
Things are getting hot here.

462
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:12,873
The wire, for fuck's sake.

463
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:22,982
Hey, you better send me
some ammo, quick!

464
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:49,775
They didn't take the money!
We'll split it!

465
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,150
Go on! Shut the door!

466
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:26,769
Go on. They're waiting for you.

467
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,078
What a great sense of timing
you guys got.

468
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:39,754
OK, guys, go!

469
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:40,915
Go, go, go, come on!

470
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,459
This way.
This way, please, everyone.

471
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,694
Come on, come on, man.
Come on, you two.

472
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,232
Good job, man.

473
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,767
Calling all units.
Operation terminated.

474
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,504
Captain!

475
00:32:55,572 --> 00:32:57,130
You're the fucking biggest
son of a bitch...

476
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:58,834
I ever met, you scumbag!

477
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,207
That's the first compliment
I've had all day.

478
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:02,768
When I think that
I trusted you like a brother.

479
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,610
A brother? You mean
like shining your car for 6 months...

480
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,013
before giving me
a real job?

481
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:09,382
Oh, that door of yours,
the one that squeaks...

482
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:24,397
Doesn't squeak anymore.

483
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:26,963
Captain Commissar,
Colonel.

484
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:28,231
Thank you. Show him in.

485
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:32,802
Hello, Damien.

486
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,844
I'd have much preferred
simply to congratulate you...

487
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,174
for last night's operation.

488
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:37,679
Unfortunately, however,
we have a real emergency.

489
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:38,840
Sit down.

490
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,907
I'd rather stand
if it's OK with you, sir.

491
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:42,008
As you like.

492
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,144
You know Mr. Krüger,
the Secretary of State...

493
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,746
for the Defense,
and Mr. Corsini, his assistant?

494
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,155
They need a man of courage...

495
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,056
for an extremely
delicate mission.

496
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:52,925
Mr. Krüger, I'll let you
explain the situation.

497
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:54,088
It happened yesterday.

498
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:55,392
In the afternoon,
we were transferring...

499
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:57,228
material in an armored vehicle...

500
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,498
when we had
what you might call a little incident.

501
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,472
No, no, no. I don't want
your dirty sponge.

502
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,007
It'll scratch the window.

503
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,440
Shit.

504
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,141
One day I'll get them for that.

505
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:20,648
The good news
is that the vehicle...

506
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:21,816
had a lot of tracers in it...

507
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,359
so we know exactly
where it's located...

508
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,054
and we're asking you
to get it back.

509
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,425
Where is it?

510
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:41,374
What's inside the truck?

511
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,909
What is this shit, anyway?

512
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,077
An experimental
scatter-type bomb...

513
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:50,779
sometimes known as
a clean bomb.

514
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:53,652
It's a prototype based
on neutron technology.

515
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,316
Medium range
about 8 kilometers.

516
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:56,689
The waves are
of short duration.

517
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,250
They're absorbed very fast.

518
00:34:58,328 --> 00:34:59,420
The risk of polluting
the atmosphere...

519
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:00,428
is close to zero.

520
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:01,987
You're worried they'll move the bomb.
Is that it?

521
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,103
It wouldn't be so clean
in the center of town, would it?

522
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:10,139
Yes, and that's one
of our primary concerns.

523
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,299
What's more,
the bomb is equipped...

524
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,003
with a timing mechanism
set for 24 hours.

525
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,772
Unfortunately, it was
triggered accidentally...

526
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:17,507
and that was exactly
one hour ago.

527
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:18,843
You mean in 23 hours, it'll...

528
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,747
It'll explode.

529
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:21,977
K2.

530
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:22,984
Yeah?

531
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:24,520
You got exactly 23 hours
to sell this mother.

532
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,024
Can't be done. Too short.

533
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:32,118
Captain, we're not asking
for your advice on this.

534
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:33,992
We're trying to explain
your mission to you.

535
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:35,554
Colonel, you know
the way I function.

536
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:36,997
I study the terrain
for weeks and weeks...

537
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:38,329
then it takes me months to infiltrate.

538
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,393
Damien, there are 2 million people
living out there...

539
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,869
and maybe half of them
are scum of the earth...

540
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,804
but the other half
are entitled to our assistance.

541
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:45,535
So you're gonna change
the way you operate...

542
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,099
unless you don't care anymore about
saving innocent people.

543
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:48,872
But accepting a mission
that's a lost cause...

544
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,243
is totally crazy.

545
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,906
You want me to defuse a bomb
in the worst barrio...

546
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,415
where I've never even been.

547
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:54,575
Couldn't be more attractive.

548
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,516
As far as the site goes,
we found you a local guide.

549
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:58,611
Plus I've got
to work with someone?

550
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,782
He's a young man
who was born there.

551
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:01,949
He knows the barrio
like a book.

552
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,287
So he'll save you
a lot of precious time.

553
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,884
And this guy,
did you force him to do it...

554
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,657
- or is he a volunteer?
- He doesn't know yet.

555
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,822
We're counting on you
to convince him.

556
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,582
Leito. Transfer.

557
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,380
- Where to?
- Shut up.

558
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:55,839
Let go of me!

559
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:57,675
Let go of me, for fuck's sake.

560
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,786
Come on, get up.

561
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,629
Prisoner 713 in the van!

562
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,561
He fuckin' bit me,
the asshole.

563
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,681
You OK?

564
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:37,947
Never better.

565
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,511
The fucker thought I let him
kick the shit out of me...

566
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,386
without doing anything.

567
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,050
Well, I'm getting out of here.

568
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:46,053
You think playing around
with the lock...

569
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,391
is really gonna
open the door?

570
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:49,295
You say that because
you don't know who I am yet.

571
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:50,492
The name's Phantom Man.

572
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,966
And Phantom Man doesn't plan...

573
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:53,127
spending eight years locked up.

574
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,898
What did they get you for?

575
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,064
Blew away five guys.

576
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,607
They weren't the right ones.

577
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,404
The guy I wanted got away.

578
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,705
What you want him for?

579
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:06,339
He murdered my father
and my two brothers.

580
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,543
And it hurts to know
this guy's still breathing.

581
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:09,710
So soon as I'm out of here...

582
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:10,775
I head for the Barrio 13...

583
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:12,913
and finish the bastard off
for good.

584
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,081
Does he live there?

585
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:16,091
Yeah, and he's gonna die there.

586
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:19,453
What's the guy's name?

587
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:20,928
Taha. You know him?

588
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:23,996
You're not missing much.

589
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,227
I made the big mistake
of trying to do...

590
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,633
some business with the guy.

591
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:28,136
He lives in a kind of hangar...

592
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,763
with an army protecting him.

593
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,705
And he struts
around the place...

594
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:33,800
him and his human vegetable.

595
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:35,242
What human vegetable?

596
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:37,212
A junkie. He keeps her on a leash...

597
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,508
like a dog or something.

598
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,447
I never saw anyone
so doped up.

599
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:42,879
Lola's her name,
I think.

600
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,654
I'll be back in two minutes flat, OK?

601
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:06,570
Hey, there's a space
here in front.

602
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:14,315
Can I drop you somewhere?

603
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:16,113
Barrio 13 will be fine.

604
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:17,346
You got it.

605
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,717
Damien.

606
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,922
Leito.

607
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,199
OK.

608
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,361
They've left the prison.

609
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:34,528
The plan's going
according to schedule.

610
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:35,764
Are they still together?

611
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,999
Yes. They're in front of the van.

612
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:38,370
Shouldn't be hard
to spot them.

613
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,533
Excellent.

614
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:40,667
Congratulations, Colonel.

615
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,268
I wouldn't claim victory so quickly.

616
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:43,573
It's much easier
to get out of prison...

617
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,239
than it is to enter Barrio 13.

618
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:46,714
And that's when we're gonna see
how good a guide...

619
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,444
your Leito is,
because without him...

620
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:49,678
Damien's gonna be
out of luck.

621
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,880
Your captain
can take care of himself.

622
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,400
I'm gonna need your help,
'cause I don't know the way.

623
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:10,530
Any idea how we can sneak in discreetly?

624
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:11,733
Yeah, go straight.

625
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:14,274
Hey, cut the shit out.
What are you doing?

626
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,335
I won't lose you this way.

627
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:18,813
Take those fucking things off me.

628
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:20,213
You want to get inside?

629
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:21,375
Yeah.

630
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:22,884
Then from now on, asshole,
I'm Phantom Man...

631
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,147
and you're gonna do
whatever I want.

632
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,245
Now floor it, huh?

633
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:28,919
And what the fuck we do now?

634
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,220
Go on, straight ahead.

635
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,080
OK, turn right now.

636
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:57,778
Turn right, I said!

637
00:40:57,854 --> 00:41:00,914
Hey, I heard you the first time,
but the wheels won't turn.

638
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,515
OK, stop the car.

639
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:04,184
The brakes are gone, too!

640
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,257
Then stop it
against another car...

641
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:12,426
but go easy.

642
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,302
I didn't say
to smash the car.

643
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,310
OK, sorry.
Did the best I could.

644
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,676
But no one's stopping you
from getting a new driver.

645
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,941
Now let me go.

646
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,210
What's wrong?
Should feel at home, man.

647
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,376
What are you talking about?

648
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:29,509
You're a cop.

649
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:31,281
And a cop who thinks
I'm an idiot doesn't live long.

650
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:32,651
Come on, Leito,
let me go.

651
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:34,314
This is where you wanted me
to take you.

652
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,983
OK, so you're here.

653
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:37,287
Now take out
your police manual...

654
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,884
and look at the page that says
"I'm up shit creek."

655
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,793
Leito, I'm not a cop,
for Christ's sake.

656
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,456
It's true. Let me go,
for fuck's sake.

657
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:43,658
It's thanks to me
you're out of jail.

658
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,200
Yeah, I wonder why
you did that.

659
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:46,895
Somebody needs me
to be set free.

660
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,460
But whatever the reason,
whatever the deal...

661
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:49,732
count me out.

662
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:52,366
Even if it's
to save your sister?

663
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,535
She doesn't need anyone
except her brother.

664
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:00,976
Fuck!

665
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,796
Hey, you know that's my car
you just fucking wrecked.

666
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:26,239
Sorry, man. I broke out
of jail an hour ago.

667
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:27,606
This piece of shit
didn't have any brakes...

668
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,110
so I was coming here
for a little shelter.

669
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,080
For shelter?
Ha ha ha!

670
00:42:32,148 --> 00:42:33,877
You got
some bad directions, man...

671
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,008
'cause this ain't Monaco.

672
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,177
It's Baghdad.

673
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:18,926
Tell 'em to calm down.

674
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:20,622
Cool it.

675
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:21,891
Easy.

676
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:23,990
Sorry about your car,
but in exchange, take mine.

677
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:25,364
How's that for a deal?

678
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,448
Well, did you sell
the bomb or not?

679
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,083
It ain't about that, Taha.

680
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,957
- It's Leito.
- Leito?

681
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:53,495
He broke out an hour ago.

682
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:56,629
It won't be long
before he starts...

683
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,166
banging the door down.

684
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,669
Hey, wake up.

685
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,368
Your brother's on his way
to rescue you.

686
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:11,371
Be careful.

687
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,040
OK.

688
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:33,697
First of all, how did you know
I was a cop?

689
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,862
The way you move.

690
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,701
Nobody around here
moves or fights like that.

691
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:37,967
It looks too clean.

692
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,406
When you come from the streets,
you got one thing more.

693
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,410
- Oh, yeah? What?
- Hate.

694
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,570
Right. Sorry to disappoint you.

695
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:44,340
Hate wasn't part
of my education, like you.

696
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:46,848
They taught me liberty,
equality, fraternity.

697
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,144
Water, gas, electricity.

698
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,083
You don't give a shit
about laws, do you, wiseass?

699
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:52,587
Sure, I do, but I want them
to be the same for everybody.

700
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:54,748
But they are, and I'm here
to make sure that they're obeyed.

701
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,917
No, no, you're just a pit bull
who bites for his master.

702
00:44:56,993 --> 00:44:58,722
Yeah, when laws aren't obeyed,
that's what I do.

703
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:01,794
This is where I was born.

704
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,730
It was already
pretty bad news.

705
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,166
Then they built a wall around this
when I was 18 years old.

706
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,863
Did I do anything
to deserve that punishment?

707
00:45:07,937 --> 00:45:10,531
No. I respected
every fucking law to the letter.

708
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,905
And I didn't quit school
in ninth grade to sell crack.

709
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,103
It's because they closed
the school down.

710
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:17,442
The only thing I ever did wrong
was getting born here.

711
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,039
And what the hell is burning
people's cars gonna change?

712
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:21,879
You know any other way
for us to get heard?

713
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:23,885
Not immediately, no.

714
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:27,548
Want me to tell you
what's going on...

715
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,886
and why I sprung you?

716
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,550
For a good cause I imagine,
am I right?

717
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,559
Yeah, for a good cause.

718
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,892
There's a bomb here
in this goddamn shithole of a barrio...

719
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:35,828
and if I don't defuse it
in two hours...

720
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,992
Barrio 13's population
will be zero.

721
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:40,262
So if I... if I think
the way you do...

722
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:42,531
I could say to myself,
"What the fuck do I care...

723
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:43,697
"if two million losers
get snuffed?"

724
00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:45,400
But no, there's always
an asshole who's willing...

725
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,272
to fight for the idea
that laws are made...

726
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,571
for everybody.

727
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,476
And now you help me
to locate that bomb...

728
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,105
or you protect
your own precious ass...

729
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,945
like all the bourgeoisie
you criticize.

730
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,417
There's really
a bomb around here?

731
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,745
I don't even want to know
why it turned up here.

732
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:01,915
- Who's got it? Taha?
- That's right.

733
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,083
He's got your sister
and my bomb.

734
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,649
That's two good reasons
to work together.

735
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,455
If you're lying again,
you're a dead man.

736
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:11,626
Deal.

737
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:15,994
So what's your plan?

738
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,903
Tell me exactly
what Taha's place is like.

739
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:19,066
I'll figure out how to sneak in.

740
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:20,803
I find the bomb,
and once it's defused...

741
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:21,969
we go after your sister.

742
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,137
Will I drink tea?

743
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:25,077
No, you got
to create a diversion.

744
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:27,480
Taha's gonna make you
his priority.

745
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,074
That way I'm sure
not to be disturbed.

746
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:30,517
You think it'll work?

747
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,722
- You got a telephone?
- Yeah.

748
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,052
Hand it over.

749
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:39,792
That's not Phantom Man.
It's James Bond.

750
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:41,830
Oh, very funny.

751
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:51,305
Yeah.

752
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:53,501
It's Leito.

753
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:54,907
How'd you get my number?

754
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,639
You can buy anything in jail.

755
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,975
Yeah, I heard you were out.

756
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,447
I'm over
at the factory opposite.

757
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:02,984
Hey, wait.
Who are you talking to?

758
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,021
Well, what do you want?

759
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,854
Listen, I'm with a cop.
He's got a deal for you.

760
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:11,860
I'll send K2 to get you.

761
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,454
What, are you out
of your fucking mind?

762
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:17,999
The plan was to sneak in,
for Christ's sake...

763
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:20,001
not to advertise
that we're coming.

764
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:21,934
Discreet in through
the back door...

765
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,371
meaning never in their face,
playing it cooler than cool.

766
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,067
Forget your police manual.

767
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,440
You're in Barrio 13.
It's different here...

768
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,172
and I know Taha by heart.

769
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:31,645
Trust me, it's our only chance.

770
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,614
So what's your plan?
We fight his 200 goons...

771
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:34,877
and the winner's
whoever's not dead?

772
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:36,145
No. No one's gonna die.

773
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,584
There's only one thing
that works with Taha...

774
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,053
and if we use it,
it will give us time.

775
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,749
- What's that?
- His curiosity.

776
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,825
Who's this cop
he's talking about?

777
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,224
Mm-mmm.

778
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:46,522
What is this?
Whenever I ask a question...

779
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:48,325
I get a "Mm-mmm."

780
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,695
Hell of a vocabulary.

781
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,994
OK, find out everything
about that guy.

782
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:52,295
I mean everything.

783
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:54,598
And I want him here,
not at the morgue.

784
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,138
I'll be right back.

785
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:00,705
Count me out. Too risky.

786
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,039
You're dead
if you do it alone.

787
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:03,544
I've always worked alone,
and I'm still around...

788
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,638
so fuck off, Jack.

789
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:07,512
I know Taha's place
like the back of my hand...

790
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,551
all the exits, even the one I dug out myself.

791
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:11,712
Dude, I'm very happy for you.
I hope your hands didn't hurt.

792
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,449
I know where the bomb is!

793
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,785
You'll never find it
without me.

794
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:16,983
A couple of minutes ago,
you didn't even know...

795
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,186
there was a bomb.

796
00:48:18,261 --> 00:48:19,626
What is this bullshit?

797
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,493
Taha's got a safety vault
for valuable things...

798
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:22,724
and I know how to get in.

799
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,096
How do you know
he put it in there?

800
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,634
Where's he gonna put it,
in the kitchen?

801
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:28,531
OK, here's the deal.

802
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:30,902
I set you free, and you shut up
and do what I say, OK?

803
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:32,440
No, I've got another deal.

804
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:33,998
You shut up,
pray my sister's alive.

805
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,942
If you behave,
I'll get your bomb.

806
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:38,207
Now uncuff me
before we're in deep shit up to our necks.

807
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:42,976
Deal.

808
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:49,116
Is this guy the cop?

809
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,989
Wow, what a sense
of deduction, K2. I'm impressed.

810
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,152
That's very funny.

811
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:55,061
If Taha doesn't finish you off,
the pleasure will be all mine.

812
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:56,428
Come on, let's go.
Follow us.

813
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:58,865
And no bullshit.
We're the nervous kind.

814
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,344
Hey!

815
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:16,851
Guard duty isn't for sleeping.

816
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:18,250
Sorry, but I dozed off.

817
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:19,948
- Where is he?
- In the back.

818
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:28,791
Did you feed him?

819
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,230
He eats all the time.

820
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:38,865
I got some work for you,
so you can stretch your legs a bit.

821
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:49,313
They could wipe out a city
with all this shit.

822
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:56,453
That's the van they transported
the bomb in it.

823
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,993
At least we're sure it's here.

824
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:07,969
Stay here, I'll pick you up on the way out.

825
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:09,402
Very funny.

826
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:27,685
Seems you got a new pal,
a fucking cop.

827
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:29,418
He's no friend of mine.

828
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:30,686
He's the only one
that can defuse...

829
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,819
- the bomb you stole.
- The only one?

830
00:50:32,895 --> 00:50:35,022
When the countdown ends,
everything goes within 8 kilometers.

831
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:36,655
And you, of course,
have come here to save us.

832
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:37,994
There's a code
that will stop the timer.

833
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:40,160
It will save more than
two million people.

834
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:41,498
The state sends us
a brave cop...

835
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,004
to save us from a nasty bomb...

836
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:45,336
that without our pal here
is gonna go boom.

837
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:47,569
Great story.
Thanks, Superman.

838
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,110
But let me be honest with you.

839
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:52,170
You see, we weren't planning
on hanging onto your bomb.

840
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:53,237
So you want it back?

841
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,874
Yeah.

842
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,282
How much?

843
00:50:58,521 --> 00:50:59,681
If I don't punch in the code
within an hour...

844
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:00,847
the bomb will explode.

845
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:02,015
I know it will explode.
So what?

846
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,183
It's no concern of mine...

847
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:04,590
as long as it's not where I live.

848
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,150
But if you don't want it
to blow up where you live...

849
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,890
well, like they say,
you better cough up a little...

850
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,659
It'll kill millions
of innocent lives.

851
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:11,791
Ah, but they should have
thought of that before...

852
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,234
when they made it,
for example, huh?

853
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,429
So, how much?

854
00:51:19,675 --> 00:51:21,905
A million.
Euros.

855
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,606
I have a million on my right
for openers.

856
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,307
Do I hear a higher offer? K2?

857
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:30,681
Two million. I have
a two million bid on my left.

858
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:31,811
So, who will double that?

859
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:36,389
- Here.
- Nice kid. Four million.

860
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,687
Four million.
Four million on my right.

861
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,818
How far you gonna go?

862
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,795
When you think our lives
aren't worth the price...

863
00:51:40,863 --> 00:51:43,093
tell me,
and I'll stop bidding.

864
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:48,227
Ten? Ten million on my left.

865
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:50,465
Good. Now things
are getting a little lively.

866
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:53,775
Well, Blues Brothers, ten million.

867
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,073
There's only one of its kind.
You want it or not?

868
00:51:58,147 --> 00:52:00,479
Well, since you got
no more to fork up...

869
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:01,777
ten million's the price.

870
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,285
Ten million going once.

871
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:05,581
Ten million going twice.

872
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,017
- Twenty.
- Whoa.

873
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:14,358
Handsome bid...
in the eleventh hour, too.

874
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:16,724
K2? Hmm?

875
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:19,267
No, that's good.
He can have it.

876
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:22,668
Twenty million. Wrap it up.

877
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,302
Twenty million
for two million victims.

878
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:26,807
That's about ten Euros a head.

879
00:52:26,876 --> 00:52:28,434
Price of a couple of burgers.

880
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:31,372
Cash or what?

881
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:33,711
Transfer. Forget cash.

882
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,717
There's not time to go
to the bank and come back.

883
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,446
The bomb will explode before.

884
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,547
Jamel, give him
our account number in the Bahamas.

885
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:48,321
First let me see the bomb.

886
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:51,161
Oh, that's funny. I was sure
you were gonna ask me that.

887
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:52,495
Help yourself.

888
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,199
Your bomb didn't have a launcher.

889
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:02,574
It's lucky I always keep
some equipment around here.

890
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:04,510
We found a Russian launcher.
We sort of modified it.

891
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,138
Your baby's ready to go.

892
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:08,979
As for the direction I decide
to point it, I'll let you guess.

893
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:28,368
You satisfied?
You've seen your bomb?

894
00:53:28,437 --> 00:53:30,837
Now make the transfer.

895
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,946
You see, Leito,
I learned something from you.

896
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,847
Now it's me
who's one step ahead.

897
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:53,662
Get me Krüger. It's urgent.

898
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:43,007
8-4-7-3-5.

899
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,673
Zulu, Zulu, Fox, Delta, Charlie.

900
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:47,079
How much has to be transferred?

901
00:54:47,149 --> 00:54:48,673
Twenty million Euros.

902
00:54:49,718 --> 00:54:52,209
Are you sure the bomb is there?

903
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,188
It's right in front of me.

904
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,190
I can even read
the 48 minutes left on the screen.

905
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,690
Captain, we don't have
that kind of budget.

906
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:01,161
You've got to manage otherwise.

907
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,527
I'm sorry.

908
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,199
OK, I'll hold.

909
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:14,936
They're doing the transfer.

910
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,307
OK, thank you, Colonel.

911
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:18,738
It's done.

912
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:20,304
Twenty million Euros
are in your account.

913
00:55:20,382 --> 00:55:22,873
I'll get started on the bomb.

914
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,613
Our deal's not quite finished.

915
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,655
Jamel, call the Bahamas,
make sure the money's arrived.

916
00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:28,019
That's what I'm doing.

917
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:37,496
The bank doesn't open
for a half an hour.

918
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,261
Let's hope it opens on time.

919
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,360
If you two don't mind,
go wait in the next room.

920
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:44,702
Get over there. On your knees.

921
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:46,400
Face the wall.
Hands behind your head.

922
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,846
Yoyo, watch these two
until you hear from me.

923
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,918
What do we do now?

924
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,820
Hey, don't forget
we did what you wanted.

925
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,155
If we'd have played it cool,
we wouldn't be here.

926
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:06,057
Yeah, and if your buddies
made the transfer...

927
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:07,152
we'd already be out of here.

928
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:08,890
Already dead, you mean.

929
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:11,432
You don't suppose Taha
would've let us out of here.

930
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,798
We'll never know,
since your pals refused to pay up.

931
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:17,898
Now at least you know
how much your life is worth.

932
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:19,201
Huh! Joking.

933
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,106
To them, I'm not worth anything at all.

934
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:28,512
Damien.

935
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:30,017
There's something not right
about this whole thing.

936
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,177
What do you mean?

937
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,278
Something, I don't know what.

938
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:35,550
They lose a bomb
like we lose our keys.

939
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:37,251
They want to get it back,
but they don't want to pay.

940
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:38,418
Look, when it comes
to blackmail...

941
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:39,552
they're very particular.

942
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:41,994
Hey, Supercop,
why are you defending them?

943
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:43,497
I'm not, but there are values...

944
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,431
real values.

945
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,799
The same ones I thought
you defended, too.

946
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:06,377
How much time we got?

947
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:13,825
37 minutes.

948
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:15,090
Wouldn't hurt
to have an idea.

949
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:17,189
Yeah, it wouldn't hurt.

950
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,826
Well, I think I've got one.

951
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:22,200
Well?

952
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:23,966
Remember the tunnel
I told you about?

953
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:25,131
The one that you dug out
with your teeth?

954
00:57:25,207 --> 00:57:26,799
That's right.

955
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:28,069
It starts in the toilet...

956
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:29,235
it's a left at the elevator.

957
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:35,311
And Yoyo, of course,
is going to let us piss together.

958
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:36,476
No, but if you think
of a good reason...

959
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:37,814
to go and see Taha...

960
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:39,353
he'll take us to the elevator.

961
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:42,155
OK.

962
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:43,919
And once we're at the elevator?

963
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,085
We improvise.

964
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,593
I've heard better plans, you know.

965
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:47,959
Got another one?

966
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,122
No.

967
00:57:49,198 --> 00:57:50,927
Then move it.

968
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,126
Get down right now.

969
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:55,795
We gotta see Taha.
It's mega-urgent.

970
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:56,963
It is, huh?

971
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:58,734
Well, for now you're going
to mega-get down...

972
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,331
and mega-keep your mouth shut...

973
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:01,467
got that?

974
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:02,635
You must be a mega-dickhead.

975
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,611
- What's your name again?
- What the fuck do you care?

976
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,772
It's for Taha.

977
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:06,940
When he asks whose fault it was...

978
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,540
that he lost
twenty million Euros...

979
00:58:08,617 --> 00:58:10,050
I don't want to get
the name wrong.

980
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,178
Listen, if you're fucking with me...

981
00:58:12,254 --> 00:58:13,551
we're going to have to snuff you.

982
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:14,953
Deal.

983
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,116
You three, come with me.

984
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,658
The rest of you, cover us.

985
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:21,459
I wish I knew what we were doing.

986
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,225
Stay loose
and just let it happen.

987
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:35,308
Get ready to go.

988
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:36,469
- Hey?
- Now!

989
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:03,371
It's down there!

990
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,407
That's the way out?
Through there? Great!

991
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:18,316
Jesus!
You should have been a cop!

992
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:19,581
- They'd have loved you!
- Follow me!

993
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:25,822
What's going on down there?!
What's happening?

994
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:27,486
Why don't you answer
when I call you?

995
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:29,224
Uh, we were in a tunnel.

996
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,061
I would like to know what the fuck
you're talking about!

997
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:33,328
Well, it was because
of those two assholes...

998
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:34,528
that got away through the tunnel.

999
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:35,865
We tried to catch up
with them...

1000
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:37,405
- but then the walkie-talkies...
- Hold on a second.

1001
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:38,633
Repeat that once more.

1002
00:59:38,707 --> 00:59:40,641
Leito and the cop, they...

1003
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:54,113
Jamel!
What about the transfer?

1004
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:00,289
We got problems, Taha.

1005
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:02,091
- He was bluffing.
- Yeah.

1006
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:03,392
You know,
I should have known!

1007
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:05,399
You can't trust a cop never...

1008
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:07,196
even with a gun to his head.

1009
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:09,499
But he'll pay for this, the bastard!

1010
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,833
I'm going to detonate the bomb!

1011
01:00:10,906 --> 01:00:13,272
Taha... Taha,
I think you had better sit down.

1012
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:18,804
They used the Bahamas
account number to move in...

1013
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,849
on all of the numbered
bank accounts, and...

1014
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,747
they cleaned them all out.

1015
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:23,944
What's our...

1016
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,188
Bahamas, Riyadh, Karachi...

1017
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,348
all of them, even London.

1018
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,324
- Nothing. Zero.
- What?

1019
01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:34,687
But how's that possible?

1020
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:37,197
If I ever learn that,
I'll be the king of the world.

1021
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:40,201
In the meantime...

1022
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,463
this dumb little accountant...

1023
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,300
is going back home.

1024
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:49,805
Excuse me.

1025
01:00:57,886 --> 01:00:59,217
Hey, Taha, if you're broke...

1026
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,812
then how the fuck
are you going to pay us this week?

1027
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,565
I got cash in the safe
downstairs.

1028
01:01:15,637 --> 01:01:17,002
No one's about
to rip that off.

1029
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,664
K2, your piece.
Hand it over.

1030
01:01:24,546 --> 01:01:25,638
K2, give it to me, huh?

1031
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,823
You are a bunch
of fucking shitheads.

1032
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,848
What do we do now, K2?

1033
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,462
First, we better find Leito
and that cop.

1034
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,503
OK, move out, everyone.

1035
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,225
We better separate!

1036
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:58,856
Out of the way! Move!

1037
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,124
Police!

1038
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:51,139
How long
before this bomb goes off?

1039
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,305
Ten minutes.

1040
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,904
And you're sure
you can defuse it.

1041
01:05:53,982 --> 01:05:55,415
Yeah. What's more,
I'm the only one.

1042
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,011
Well, you go and stop it,
and Leito stays with us.

1043
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:00,452
No, I need him
to come with me.

1044
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:01,580
No can do.

1045
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:03,783
OK. Leito and me
will stay here...

1046
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,190
and you defuse the bomb.
How's that?

1047
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,921
You better go.
You've only got nine minutes.

1048
01:06:10,893 --> 01:06:12,451
OK, you both go.

1049
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:13,825
I'll wait for you down below.

1050
01:06:13,896 --> 01:06:15,659
You gotta come down
sooner or later, huh?

1051
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:16,698
If I do the job,
I bet even you...

1052
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:18,097
will be glad to see a cop's face.

1053
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:19,225
Hmm.

1054
01:06:48,931 --> 01:06:51,058
What the hell is that?

1055
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:52,259
A present from Taha.

1056
01:06:53,936 --> 01:06:55,563
Let me handle this.
I love presents.

1057
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:48,354
Hey, Mongo! You ready now...

1058
01:07:48,424 --> 01:07:49,652
for me to teach you
a thing or two?

1059
01:08:27,463 --> 01:08:29,090
Hey! He's all yours.

1060
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,511
Nice going!
Where did you learn that?

1061
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,740
In a cookbook or official manual...

1062
01:08:45,815 --> 01:08:47,043
I don't remember.

1063
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:16,842
It's all over, Lola, It's all over.

1064
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:21,483
No, sorry,
but it's far from over.

1065
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,387
Fuck it,
I can't get through.

1066
01:09:30,192 --> 01:09:32,023
OK, got it.

1067
01:09:32,094 --> 01:09:33,584
Don't worry.
He's an expert at the cuffs.

1068
01:09:33,662 --> 01:09:34,788
He'll get them off you.

1069
01:09:38,534 --> 01:09:40,092
- Hello?
- Captain Tomaso.

1070
01:09:40,169 --> 01:09:41,864
I've got the bomb in front of me.
I need the code.

1071
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:43,063
Where are you now?

1072
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,901
The bomb's in front of me
with 31/2 minutes left.

1073
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:46,305
Give me the code,
and we'll talk later.

1074
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:47,569
Where are you? The exact spot.

1075
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:50,203
On the roof of a building
in Barrio 13.

1076
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,405
Do you want
the weather forecast as well?!

1077
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,744
Good work, Tomaso.
We're all very proud of you.

1078
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:55,078
Thanks, but time's running out.

1079
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,380
9-2-9-3...

1080
01:09:57,453 --> 01:09:58,852
9-2-9-3...

1081
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:01,287
3-7-0-9-B-13.

1082
01:10:01,357 --> 01:10:02,585
7-0-9-B-13.

1083
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:04,285
I'll call you back
if I'm still alive.

1084
01:10:12,635 --> 01:10:14,569
B-13? Like Barrio 13?

1085
01:10:14,637 --> 01:10:16,332
- Yeah.
- Doesn't it seem strange...

1086
01:10:16,405 --> 01:10:17,804
that the bomb's code is Barrio 13...

1087
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:20,034
92, 93, the two zones we're in?

1088
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,407
Just coincidence.

1089
01:10:22,478 --> 01:10:23,911
Damien, wait! Hold on.

1090
01:10:23,979 --> 01:10:25,071
If the bomb wasn't scheduled
to come here...

1091
01:10:25,147 --> 01:10:26,808
why the hell does it have
the same number as this barrio?

1092
01:10:26,882 --> 01:10:29,578
Look, whatever it is,
I've got to stop it, OK?

1093
01:10:29,652 --> 01:10:31,244
Damien, listen.
What if it's the reverse?

1094
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,252
The reverse of what?

1095
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,255
You detonate the bomb
with the code instead.

1096
01:10:34,323 --> 01:10:35,950
Why send me, then,
if they wanted the fucking thing...

1097
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:37,822
to explode in the first place?
Explain that!

1098
01:10:37,893 --> 01:10:39,360
So it blows up right here
where they want...

1099
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:40,725
the center of Barrio 13.

1100
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:41,990
"Give me the exact spot."

1101
01:10:42,064 --> 01:10:43,793
Wasn't that what
your boss asked?

1102
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:45,527
Yeah, but that's
a security measure!

1103
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:46,795
It's a trap, Damien,
I'm sure!

1104
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:48,461
Get off my back
and let me work!

1105
01:10:55,511 --> 01:10:57,103
I've already saved your life once,
so trust me!

1106
01:10:57,179 --> 01:10:59,443
I'm a soldier!
I've got a mission to do!

1107
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,251
Cut this shit out, Leito!

1108
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:46,385
In one minute,
we're all going to...

1109
01:11:46,462 --> 01:11:47,520
Open your eyes, Damien!

1110
01:11:47,596 --> 01:11:49,029
Nobody gives a shit
about this barrio.

1111
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:50,690
Twenty years, and they can't
solve the problem.

1112
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:51,858
They built a wall around us...

1113
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:53,663
now they're going
to clean it out for good.

1114
01:11:53,736 --> 01:11:55,203
How come there are
no civil servants here?

1115
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,170
No post office or schools,
and just by chance...

1116
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:58,570
the police station
was shut down.

1117
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,505
But the bomb was stolen, Leito.
They didn't make that up.

1118
01:12:00,576 --> 01:12:02,635
Oh, yeah, the bomb was attacked
by some bad guys, right?

1119
01:12:02,711 --> 01:12:04,611
Yeah.

1120
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,669
That's the story
they told you, huh?

1121
01:12:05,748 --> 01:12:06,840
- Yeah.
- Then tell me why...

1122
01:12:06,915 --> 01:12:08,780
just before we saw the van,
it was intact.

1123
01:12:08,851 --> 01:12:10,148
Where were the signs
of an explosion...

1124
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:11,709
of a smashed-in door?

1125
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:12,754
Maybe it was a different one.

1126
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:14,345
It was the same,
and you know damn well.

1127
01:12:14,423 --> 01:12:15,515
And once they were sure...

1128
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:17,058
the bomb was on
the inside of Barrio 13...

1129
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:18,525
and that it wasn't
going anywhere...

1130
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:20,357
they got their best pit bull
to set it in motion.

1131
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:22,056
And you really accomplished that mission.

1132
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:23,189
You stopped Taha
from dumping it...

1133
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:24,357
so it's all for us.

1134
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:46,746
It can't be possible, Leito!

1135
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:48,119
You don't kill
two million people...

1136
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,248
'cause you can't
solve their problems!

1137
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:50,416
No? They murdered six million...

1138
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,460
because none of them
were blond with blue eyes!

1139
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:11,403
Sorry, Leito.

1140
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,094
Sorry.

1141
01:13:28,163 --> 01:13:29,187
Get off me!

1142
01:13:29,264 --> 01:13:31,323
I prefer dying for my brother's dumb ideas
than for yours.

1143
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:04,195
It's over?

1144
01:14:04,266 --> 01:14:05,995
This time it really is over.

1145
01:14:10,973 --> 01:14:12,736
It's not over.

1146
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:31,354
I told you that even you...

1147
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:32,654
would be glad to see my face.

1148
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:35,386
You got five minutes
to leave here.

1149
01:14:35,464 --> 01:14:37,432
Can I take a souvenir?

1150
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,258
Yeah, be my guest.

1151
01:14:49,244 --> 01:14:51,712
Uh-huh.

1152
01:14:53,215 --> 01:14:55,012
Thank you. Nothing yet.

1153
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,449
Jesus Christ, it's well over an hour
that we've been waiting.

1154
01:14:57,519 --> 01:14:58,850
And if by tonight nothing happens,
then what?

1155
01:14:58,921 --> 01:15:00,320
I've no idea, Corsini.
For Christ's sake...

1156
01:15:00,389 --> 01:15:02,721
it's supposed to explode
and that's that.

1157
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:03,883
What's going on?

1158
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:05,187
Sounds like a fight.

1159
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,227
Go and have a look!

1160
01:15:20,275 --> 01:15:21,572
There.
Mission accomplished.

1161
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:23,634
Well, not quite.
At the last minute...

1162
01:15:23,712 --> 01:15:25,270
we couldn't remember the code.

1163
01:15:25,347 --> 01:15:26,712
- But we both tried, didn't we?
- Mm-hmm.

1164
01:15:26,782 --> 01:15:27,874
But it's my fault, totally.

1165
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,349
It was me
who forgot the numbers.

1166
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:31,079
- You remember yours, right?
- Oh, yeah.

1167
01:15:31,153 --> 01:15:32,245
Hey, he's incredible.

1168
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,482
We made an absolutely
fantastic team, you know?

1169
01:15:34,556 --> 01:15:36,581
And without Leito,
I'd be dead now.

1170
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:38,148
OK, let's have it.

1171
01:15:38,227 --> 01:15:41,287
92, 93.

1172
01:15:41,363 --> 01:15:43,490
- Wow, like the two zone numbers.
- Yeah.

1173
01:15:43,565 --> 01:15:45,123
That's wild, eh?

1174
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,997
A coincidence.

1175
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:48,297
Now, we got 7-0-9.

1176
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:50,395
Easy to remember,
that's today's date.

1177
01:15:50,472 --> 01:15:53,703
7-0-9. September 7...

1178
01:15:53,775 --> 01:15:55,106
end of the summer holidays.

1179
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:56,769
Practical, eh?
A bomb explodes on the day...

1180
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,506
you know everyone's
around for sure...

1181
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:01,014
and you get rid of
all the scum in one shot.

1182
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,482
If I'm mistaken, please stop me.

1183
01:16:02,551 --> 01:16:05,577
Now then, the code.

1184
01:16:05,654 --> 01:16:08,179
I think that I've got the rest of it.

1185
01:16:08,257 --> 01:16:11,454
B13. Like Barrio 13.

1186
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:14,461
How could I forget?

1187
01:16:14,529 --> 01:16:15,791
Why don't I give you
the honor of finishing?

1188
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:18,128
Are you telling me you plan
on blowing up this bomb here in Paris?!

1189
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,634
I'm sorry, but I thought the code was
to defuse the bomb.

1190
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:22,602
You mean that if I punch it in,
it'll do the opposite...

1191
01:16:22,671 --> 01:16:24,832
Stop playing the fool, Tomaso!
You know perfectly well!

1192
01:16:24,906 --> 01:16:26,635
No, I don't. Explain it to me.
I want to know why...

1193
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,835
Barrio 13 is uncontrollable.
It costs a fortune to the state.

1194
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:29,968
The taxpayers are worried.

1195
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:32,605
Worried, frightened, and fed up
with paying for such scum!

1196
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:34,444
So we clean it out with a bomb?

1197
01:16:34,516 --> 01:16:37,144
Yes. It's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1198
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:39,119
Except one. Yours, sir.

1199
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:41,446
No, I beg of you! Please!

1200
01:16:41,523 --> 01:16:42,615
Look, why don't we clean up everything?

1201
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:43,783
Do you want us all killed?!

1202
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:46,384
You should have thought
of that when you built it!

1203
01:16:46,461 --> 01:16:48,156
No!

1204
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:02,870
You really thought I was going
to go through with it.

1205
01:17:02,944 --> 01:17:04,468
Why? For revenge?

1206
01:17:04,546 --> 01:17:07,674
No, you don't always need
violence to solve problems.

1207
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:09,478
There are
more democratic ways.

1208
01:17:10,852 --> 01:17:12,717
Look out of the window,
and smile.

1209
01:17:15,724 --> 01:17:17,214
Was the sound OK?

1210
01:17:19,394 --> 01:17:20,725
What are you plotting, Tomaso?

1211
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:23,356
I'm doing my job, sir.
You know what my job is?

1212
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:26,128
I see that laws are obeyed.
Obeyed by everyone.

1213
01:17:26,201 --> 01:17:27,668
I make sure
that no one forgets that.

1214
01:17:27,736 --> 01:17:29,533
That's my job...
no more, no less.

1215
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:32,937
Now, if you still
don't understand...

1216
01:17:33,008 --> 01:17:34,839
you can see it all on network TV.

1217
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,844
As well as internet reservations.

1218
01:17:36,912 --> 01:17:38,038
You can also purchase
your ticket...

1219
01:17:38,113 --> 01:17:40,843
on the train from a conductor.

1220
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:43,510
No tickets are as yet available
at ticket windows

1221
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:45,678
and this may continue for some time.

1222
01:17:45,754 --> 01:17:48,188
For rail companies,
it's impossible to estimate...

1223
01:17:48,256 --> 01:17:50,554
when the computer breakdown
will be repaired.

1224
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:53,492
As you know,
it has now been twenty-four hours...

1225
01:17:53,562 --> 01:17:55,860
Barrio 13 is uncontrollable.
It costs a fortune to the state.

1226
01:17:55,931 --> 01:17:57,956
The taxpayers are worried.
Worried, frightened...

1227
01:17:58,033 --> 01:17:59,591
and fed up with paying
for such scum!

1228
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:02,193
So we clean it out
with a bomb?

1229
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,795
Yes. It's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1230
01:18:04,873 --> 01:18:07,501
Barrio 13 is uncontrollable.
It costs a fortune to the state.

1231
01:18:07,576 --> 01:18:09,669
The taxpayers are worried.
Worried, frightened...

1232
01:18:09,745 --> 01:18:11,872
and fed up with paying
for such scum!

1233
01:18:11,947 --> 01:18:13,915
So we clean it out
with a bomb?

1234
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:16,883
Yes. It's not very democratic,
but it solves all the problems.

1235
01:18:16,952 --> 01:18:19,079
Except one. Yours, sir.

1236
01:18:42,577 --> 01:18:44,442
You sure you don't want
to stay on this side?

1237
01:18:44,513 --> 01:18:45,980
With the reward
you're going to get...

1238
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:47,571
you could buy a real nice place.

1239
01:18:47,649 --> 01:18:49,116
I got a nice place.

1240
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,674
Besides, this is where I live.

1241
01:18:50,752 --> 01:18:52,276
I was born here.

1242
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:54,254
Now all I want to do
is live here in peace.

1243
01:18:54,322 --> 01:18:56,085
But you will, Leito.
They're going to be...

1244
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:58,217
demolishing the wall
next week.

1245
01:18:58,293 --> 01:18:59,385
The police, the post office...

1246
01:18:59,461 --> 01:19:02,089
and the school
all open next month.

1247
01:19:02,164 --> 01:19:04,826
You know
it's down to you, all of that.

1248
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,834
Older brother,
you're the greatest!

1249
01:19:06,902 --> 01:19:08,267
I've been saying that for years!

1250
01:19:08,336 --> 01:19:11,965
Come on, smile.
Lighten up.

1251
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,667
I hope things don't get
messed up on the way...

1252
01:19:13,742 --> 01:19:14,970
and that they keep their promises.

1253
01:19:15,043 --> 01:19:16,101
Hey, these things aren't words.

1254
01:19:16,178 --> 01:19:17,805
They were voted on.

1255
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:19,210
And government decrees
have to be applied.

1256
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:20,373
It's the law.

1257
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:21,814
And there's always
an asshole like me around...

1258
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:23,373
to see that laws are obeyed.

1259
01:19:26,555 --> 01:19:27,544
Take care of yourself.

1260
01:19:27,622 --> 01:19:29,954
You make it sound as if
I live in the barrio like you.

1261
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:32,516
Your neighborhood's
more dangerous than mine.

1262
01:19:32,594 --> 01:19:34,152
I'm not so sure.

1263
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:38,458
Come and see us?

1264
01:19:38,533 --> 01:19:41,661
I can't promise.

1265
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:50,004
He'll come, yeah.

1266
01:19:54,816 --> 01:19:56,113
Hello.

1267
01:19:57,486 --> 01:19:58,783
Thank you.

1268
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:03,416
Go on.
