1
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,660
Alexander, the army will divide.

2
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,940
Satrapies will revolt.
Without your orders, there'll be war.

3
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,620
We beg you. Tell us who.

4
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,460
Our world is gone now.

5
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,100
I'm the last left alive.

6
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,140
Whether that's a blessing or a curse...

7
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,620
who by Hades would know.

8
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,180
But I've paid my price...

9
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,060
in blood.

10
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,460
And in broken dreams.

11
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,460
They say we were the greatest
fighting force ever known to man.

12
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,300
Greater even than the expedition to Troy.

13
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,300
But how can I say it?

14
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
How can I tell you what it is like
to be young...

15
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,140
and to dream big dreams?

16
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,140
To believe when Alexander looked you
in the eye, you could do anything.

17
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,020
Anything.

18
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:17,660
In his presence, by the light of Apollo,
we were better than ourselves.

19
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,740
Truly, I've known many great men
in my life...

20
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,860
but only one colossus.

21
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,540
And only now, when old...

22
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,740
do I understand
who this force of nature really was.

23
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,020
Or do I?

24
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,500
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

25
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,020
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

26
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,900
Men, all men, reach and fall...

27
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,380
reach and fall.

28
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,060
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

29
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,620
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

30
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,860
Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

31
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,900
For 100 years now, the Persian kings
had bribed the Greeks...

32
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,060
with their gold
to fight as mercenaries.

33
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,580
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

34
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,580
uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

35
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,940
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

36
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,900
that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

37
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,540
He then turned his eye on Persia...

38
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,660
where it was said the
Great King Darius himself...

39
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,860
on his throne in Babylon,
feared Philip.

40
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
Philip was murdered...

41
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,580
much to Persia's delight and
perhaps sponsored by their gold.

42
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,980
And Alexander, at 20
became the new ruler of Macedonia.

43
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,900
Announcing revenge
for the death of Philip...

44
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,060
Alexander liberated
all of the cities of western Asia...

45
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,780
south to Egypt...

46
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,020
where he was declared
Pharaoh of Egypt...

47
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,620
and worshipped as a god.

48
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,580
And finally, he provoked
the rise to battle...

49
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,780
in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

50
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,820
<i>It was mad.</i>

51
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,500
<i>Forty thousand of us against
hundreds of thousands...</i>

52
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,340
<i>of barbarian races unknown to us...</i>

53
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,940
<i>gathered under Darius himself.</i>

54
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>East and west had now come together...</i>

55
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,980
<i>to decide the fate of the known world.</i>

56
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,380
<i>It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.</i>

57
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,060
<i>Son of a god.</i>

58
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,300
<i>It was a myth, of course.</i>

59
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,260
<i>At least it started as a myth.</i>

60
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,340
<i>I know.</i>

61
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,940
<i>I was there.</i>

62
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,260
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

63
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,260
Kill Darius?

64
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,580
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

65
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,820
If I die, it's one Macedonian.

66
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,780
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

67
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,260
<i>Here. Right here, we cut the throat
of the Persian army.</i>

68
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,740
<i>This is madness. You'll never get
within 100 paces of him.</i>

69
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

70
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,580
<i>Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...</i>

71
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,140
<i>with your son Philotas
for just one, two hours tomorrow.</i>

72
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,340
And you, unbreakable Antigonus,
the center phalanx.

73
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,660
<i>Perdiccas, Leonnatus...</i>

74
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,740
<i>Nearchus, Polyperchon.</i>

75
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,020
If you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas, here in the center...

76
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,180
their cavalry will follow me
out to the right.

77
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,820
<i>And when bold Cassander breaks,
stretching their left...</i>

78
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,860
a hole will open.
Then I and my cavalry...

79
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,420
<i>Our revered Cleitus...</i>

80
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,860
Ptolemy and Hephaistion.

81
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,060
Will strike through that gap...

82
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,620
and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

83
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,300
Since when, by the light of Apollo, has
cavalry been used to break an infantry line?

84
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,420
<i>What was it we did to
Chaeronea, Parmenion?</i>

85
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,460
Alexander, even with luck, timing, the gods,
they're at least five to our one...

86
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,700
which means in truth we must rout them
tomorrow, destroy their army completely.

87
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,380
<i>Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home.</i>

88
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,620
<i>Right.</i>

89
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,220
<i>You speak of home and retreat...</i>

90
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,220
but do you understand, Parmenion?

91
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,020
Babylon's my new home.

92
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,580
Alexander...

93
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,020
if we must fight...

94
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,980
do so with stealth.

95
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,100
<i>Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.</i>

96
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,780
<i>I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.</i>

97
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,700
<i>No, you are too honorable for that.</i>

98
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,460
<i>No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.</i>

99
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,340
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

100
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,500
The lands west of the Euphrates, Alexander,
the hand of his daughter in marriage.

101
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,780
Since when has a Greek
been given such honors?

102
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,100
There are not honors, Parmenion,
they're bribes...

103
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,060
which the Greeks
have accepted too long.

104
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,620
Do you forget that
the man who murdered my father...

105
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,300
<i>- Lies across the valley floor?
- Come, Alexander...</i>

106
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,300
we're still not really sure if it was
Persian gold behind the assassination.

107
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
But that is no matter!

108
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,700
<i>Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.</i>

109
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,700
<i>Now I urge you...</i>

110
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,940
with all my experience, regroup.

111
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,260
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

112
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,020
I would, if I were Parmenion.

113
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,380
But I am Alexander.

114
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,300
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

115
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,460
These are my terms.

116
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,180
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

117
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,500
then he'll come to me tomorrow.

118
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,740
And when he bows down to Greece...

119
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,460
Alexander will be merciful.

120
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,860
By Ares' chains, he has got balls, men.

121
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,860
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

122
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,420
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

123
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,620
I've seen one before.
It was still alive.

124
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,540
To whom do you pray?

125
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,620
Phobos.

126
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,500
Fear?

127
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,540
A bad omen.

128
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,940
More so for Darius.

129
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,460
I've come to believe the fear of death
drives all men, Hephaistion.

130
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,260
And this we didn't learn as schoolboys.

131
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,460
It is the cause of all of our misfortunes.

132
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,300
<i>- So, mighty Crateros.
- Your Majesty.</i>

133
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,460
- Are you ready for tomorrow?
- It's been too long coming if you ask me.

134
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,020
The men are skittish as colts and
the damn bulls won't shut their snouts.

135
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,660
Good. Fear makes men fight better.

136
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,860
Post your sentries alertly
but rest them well.

137
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,300
Don't you worry, general. I'm known to
sleep with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

138
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,580
Only because someone
might steal his loot, sire.

139
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,860
<i>Well, someone owes Crateros
for his cheapness.</i>

140
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,300
He buys neither gloves nor blankets
to warm himself.

141
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,180
Who needs gloves
when you come from grace?

142
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,220
Who needs clothes
when you can fight naked?

143
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,020
He's right.

144
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,100
After tomorrow, even the thrifty
among you shall be kings.

145
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,380
<i>- The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
- We'll stain the ground...</i>

146
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,540
in Persian blood, my king.

147
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,180
<i>You're on the first row tomorrow, boy.</i>

148
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,340
I've always believed, Alexander...

149
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,700
but this seems so much bigger than us.

150
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,540
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when they
stood side by side at the seat of Troy?

151
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,580
Patroclus died first.

152
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,420
If you do...

153
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,940
If you were to fall, Hephaistion,
even if Macedonia were to lose a king...

154
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,860
I will avenge you.

155
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,900
And follow you down
to the house of death.

156
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,220
I would do the same.

157
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,060
On the eve of battle,
it's hardest to be alone.

158
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,700
Then perhaps...

159
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,380
Perhaps this is farewell then...

160
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,580
my Alexander.

161
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,700
Fear not, Hephaistion.
We are at the beginning.

162
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,300
Blood makes the world rise.

163
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,660
Blood makes the rain fall.

164
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,380
Blood makes the earth grow.

165
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:36,860
And in blood, all men are born and die.

166
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,380
Blood is the food of the gods below.

167
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,260
<i>Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.</i>

168
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,860
<i>Company, group! Regroup!</i>

169
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Phalanx, turn right!

170
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,020
Phalanx, attention!

171
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,300
<i>Neoptolemus.</i>

172
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,340
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tyre.

173
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,780
<i>You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?</i>

174
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,860
Dexippos, by Athena.

175
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,180
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

176
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,020
Will you match it with your spear?

177
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,900
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

178
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,820
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

179
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,580
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

180
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,700
<i>You fight for them today.</i>

181
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,180
<i>You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.</i>

182
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,100
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

183
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,900
where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army...

184
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,740
<i>But ask yourselves...</i>

185
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,460
who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

186
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,900
to murder my father, our king...

187
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,940
in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

188
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,740
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

189
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,980
Who is this king but a king of air?

190
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,420
These men do not fight for their homes.

191
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,060
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

192
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,220
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

193
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,420
because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

194
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,860
But we are not here today as slaves.

195
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,260
We are here today...

196
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,100
as Macedonian freemen!

197
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,660
And though outnumbered...

198
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,540
I say to you who know
the price of tyranny...

199
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,740
who've carried the Persian yoke
too long...

200
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,300
you have a strength
born of your hearts...

201
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,500
and all their arms, their numbers...

202
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,140
their chariots and all their fine horses...

203
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,100
will mean nothing
in the hands of slaves.

204
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,500
Some of you...

205
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,580
perhaps myself...

206
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,620
will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

207
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,420
For I will be
in the very thick of battle with you.

208
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,300
<i>But remember this:</i>

209
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,180
The greatest honor
a man can ever achieve...

210
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,580
is to live with great courage
and to die with his countrymen...

211
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,580
in battle for his home.

212
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
I say to you...

213
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,500
what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

214
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,060
<i>Conquer your fear...</i>

215
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,660
<i>and I promise you,
you will conquer death.</i>

216
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,460
And someday I vow to you...

217
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,420
your sons and your grandsons
will look into your eyes.

218
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,140
And when they ask why you
fought so bravely at Gaugamela...

219
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,900
you will answer...

220
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,940
<i>with all the strength
of your great, great hearts:</i>

221
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,020
"I was here this day at Gaugamela..."

222
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,300
for the freedom...

223
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,540
and glory...

224
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,860
"...of Greece!"

225
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,100
Zeus be with us!

226
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,660
<i>Cassander! Four columns, go!</i>

227
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,060
Where does he go?

228
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,580
<i>I don't know, Majesty.</i>

229
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,580
Envelop him, Bessus.

230
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,380
Hephaistion, go!

231
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,620
Phalanx!

232
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,420
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

233
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,100
<i>Yes, great king.</i>

234
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,220
Be brave, men.

235
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,820
Steady on the left, lads!

236
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,860
Bend if you must, but never break.

237
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,060
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

238
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,900
Pick up the pace!

239
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,420
Prepare to repel chariots!

240
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,300
Forward!

241
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,180
<i>Cassander!</i>

242
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,700
- Forward, men!
- Forward!

243
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,740
<i>- Left turn!
- Infantry, clear! Out now!</i>

244
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,700
Hold your positions!

245
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,700
Father! We must
fall back to the gully, Father.

246
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,420
<i>No, hold.</i>

247
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,500
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

248
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,060
<i>- Move!
- Yes, sir.</i>

249
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,140
<i>Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!</i>

250
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,500
Drive for the hole!

251
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,060
- Drive for the hole!
- Drive for the hole!

252
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,820
Prince Merdicus, bring these men up.

253
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,500
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

254
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,740
- General!
- Get to your home! And go home fast.

255
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,660
I cannot see!

256
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,820
- Philotas! Philotas!
- Father.

257
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,060
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

258
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,820
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

259
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,540
<i>Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!</i>

260
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,100
Darius!

261
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,460
Find your horses.

262
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,700
Darius!

263
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,340
Go! Go!

264
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,580
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

265
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,620
Provision the horses.

266
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,020
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

267
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,940
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

268
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,260
Parmenion's crumbling.

269
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,060
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

270
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,460
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

271
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,300
<i>You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...</i>

272
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,420
but you'll never run far enough!

273
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,260
To Parmenion!

274
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,300
<i>You bleed free, my lord.</i>

275
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,740
<i>- May I tend to your wound?
- No, Hermolaus, not now.</i>

276
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,340
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

277
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,380
Help them.

278
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,060
How was this done, soldier?

279
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,260
Spear.

280
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,660
But I got two of the buggers.

281
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,540
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

282
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,780
<i>You're very brave.</i>

283
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,940
What shall I call you?

284
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,980
- Glaukos, my king.
- Glaukos.

285
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,900
- And where's your home?
- Illyria.

286
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,980
<i>Let your body go loose.</i>

287
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Think of home now.

288
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,100
Be brave again, Glaukos...

289
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,180
and you will live on in glory.

290
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,420
Alexander.

291
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,540
<i>The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...</i>

292
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,900
<i>was destroyed.</i>

293
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,220
<i>And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.</i>

294
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,420
If you hesitate, she will strike.

295
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,140
<i>Yes.</i>

296
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,700
They are like people.

297
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:35,900
<i>You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...</i>

298
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,460
but still, they can turn on you.

299
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,460
Don't hurt her.

300
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,780
Good.

301
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,660
<i>Now...</i>

302
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,860
He calls me a barbarian.

303
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,620
He makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

304
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,260
<i>Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...</i>

305
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,860
<i>and said that Alexander
was the child of Zeus.</i>

306
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,500
<i>Others, Dionysus.</i>

307
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:43,260
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

308
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,420
<i>But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...</i>

309
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.</i>

310
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,340
My little Achilles.

311
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,860
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

312
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,340
What is it you want?

313
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,380
Six months. Did you miss me?

314
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,060
<i>- No. Not here!
- Proud bitch. I'm still your king.</i>

315
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,420
King of what? Sheepherders?

316
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,940
- I am of Achilles' royal blood.
- The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

317
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,780
<i>- You are nothing but a drunken whore.
- Shut your mouth.</i>

318
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,580
<i>You 10-titted bitch from Hades!</i>

319
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,740
Which god could I curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

320
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,180
Do you think people respect you?

321
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,060
<i>You think they don't know your bastards?</i>

322
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,860
<i>Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!</i>

323
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,260
I told you not! I told you not.

324
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,180
<i>- You'll obey me.
- I will not.</i>

325
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,700
<i>You'll obey me, or I'll kill you
with my own hands.</i>

326
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,340
<i>Let her go! No! Stop! Papa!</i>

327
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,540
<i>- Obey me!
- Your Majesty! No!</i>

328
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,100
In the name of the gods.

329
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,500
<i>He will never be yours! Never!</i>

330
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,300
In my womb, I carried my avenger!

331
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,020
<i>In the world he grew up to...</i>

332
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,140
<i>I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.</i>

333
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,740
<i>You don't need much to fight.</i>

334
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,180
<i>When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...</i>

335
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,220
courage won't be in
the soles of your feet, Perdiccas.

336
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,260
Or in the thickness
of your tunic, Philotas.

337
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,180
<i>Or in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.</i>

338
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,740
It's in the heart of a man.

339
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,980
<i>You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.</i>

340
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,060
<i>You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...</i>

341
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,460
<i>when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.</i>

342
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,100
<i>Come on, Alexander.</i>

343
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,940
Where's your hunger
to twist Hephaistion's head off?

344
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,380
Is he stronger than you?
Then beat him another way.

345
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?</i>

346
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:28,380
<i>The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.</i>

347
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,540
Good, Hephaistion. That's it.

348
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,260
Well done. Good wrestling, Hephaistion.
That's what I want.

349
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,780
<i>Come, come, come.</i>

350
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,860
<i>You did well, but you lost.</i>

351
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,420
<i>Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.</i>

352
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,700
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

353
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,980
<i>You're right.</i>

354
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,220
But I promise you, I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

355
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,460
<i>It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...</i>

356
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,580
<i>except by Hephaistion's thighs.</i>

357
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,260
Although an inferior race...

358
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,900
the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

359
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,540
From Ethiopia and Egypt in the south...

360
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,260
<i>to Caucasus and the two inland seas
in the north...</i>

361
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,940
<i>Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.</i>

362
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,660
They rule, and we sit around like frogs.

363
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,060
<i>- Master?
- Yes?</i>

364
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,540
- Master!
- Out with it!

365
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,540
<i>- Why are the Persians so cruel?
- Oh, come on, Nearchus.</i>

366
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,700
<i>That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.</i>

367
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,860
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

368
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,300
and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

369
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,580
Which are so dull,
they castrate young boys...

370
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,540
such as yourselves,
for their sexual pleasure.

371
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,740
<i>Yes. Excess in all things
is the undoing of men.</i>

372
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,820
That is why we Greeks are superior.

373
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,220
We practice control of our senses.

374
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,620
Moderation, we hope.

375
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,740
Then what of Achilles at Troy, master?

376
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,340
- Was he not excessive?
- Achilles simply lacks restraint.

377
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,300
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

378
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,740
crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

379
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,980
he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

380
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,060
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

381
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,740
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

382
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,660
and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

383
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,340
<i>Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.</i>

384
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,860
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

385
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,660
that is pure and excellent.

386
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,020
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

387
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,100
this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

388
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,740
and lift us from our frog pond.

389
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,940
<i>But can a man
love a woman equally, master?</i>

390
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,780
A woman? Of course not.

391
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,580
A woman is a slave
to her passion, Hephaistion.

392
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,900
Oh, naturally there are exceptions,
and we must honor them.

393
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,100
Such as Pallas Athena,
goddess of wisdom and war.

394
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,620
But never forget, she is sprung not from
the loins of Zeus, but from his mind.

395
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,420
<i>Now, you think on all this,
my young frogs...</i>

396
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:41,340
for in you resides
the future of Greek civilization.

397
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,780
To strive for honor
is the highest purpose of all.

398
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,500
To rule over our baser emotions.

399
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,500
To follow reason,
the divine part in each of you.

400
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,020
<i>Yes...</i>

401
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,460
to love excellence
is truly to love the gods.

402
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,260
<i>Now, will you stop distracting me?</i>

403
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,300
Back to geography
and things that we know.

404
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,100
<i>Is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...</i>

405
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,940
could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

406
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:21,100
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

407
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,020
by this river east, down
into the great plains of India...

408
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,780
out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

409
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,860
<i>and by this route up the Nile...</i>

410
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,100
back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

411
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,900
<i>Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...</i>

412
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:49,020
and act on their favored position
at the center...

413
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,300
Greece could rule the world.

414
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:57,020
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

415
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,540
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

416
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:09,220
<i>All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.</i>

417
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,340
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

418
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,020
<i>Why? Unless there was truth to them?</i>

419
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,820
<i>Tales of Amazons? Minotaurs, Gorgons,
Icarus flying into the sun? No, Alexander.</i>

420
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,820
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

421
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,580
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

422
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,860
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

423
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,020
It is-It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

424
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,860
My father long wants it.

425
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,860
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

426
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:56,060
But still, to think it's these myths
that lead us forward to the greatest glory...

427
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,620
why is it wrong to act on them?

428
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,420
I can only warn you, not teach you.

429
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,660
Beware of what you dream for.

430
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,100
The gods have a way
of punishing such pride.

431
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,780
<i>And growing more ambitious, he now
planned the invasion of Persia.</i>

432
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,380
<i>The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, I'll ride him myself.</i>

433
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,900
<i>No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.</i>

434
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,060
<i>Not with your leg.</i>

435
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,140
He's been beaten far too often.

436
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,020
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

437
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,980
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

438
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,300
For three and a half talents...

439
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,140
I couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you...

440
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,100
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

441
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,660
Do I seem so old?

442
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,260
- Stay down, stay down.
- Hold him!

443
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,820
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

444
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,380
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

445
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,420
And if you don't?

446
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,180
- I'll pay for him myself.
- With what, your singing voice?

447
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,140
I'll pay you!

448
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,740
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

449
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,660
He can be ridden. By me.

450
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,580
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

451
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,740
at half the price.

452
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,940
That horse will kill him, Philip.

453
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,420
- He'll break the boy in two.
- Will he?

454
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,380
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

455
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,860
<i>You don't like your shadow, do you?</i>

456
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,060
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

457
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:36,140
Do you see? That's us.

458
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,980
<i>It's just a trick of Apollo's.</i>

459
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,620
He's the god of the sun.

460
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,220
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

461
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,500
The boy doesn't have the craft, Philip.
He could hurt himself.

462
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,100
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

463
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,100
Good idea.

464
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,540
Indeed there are times, Philip,
when I wonder if he is your blood.

465
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,300
- I only worry that-
- What was that, Attalus?

466
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,780
<i>Nothing.</i>

467
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,900
<i>I was just noticing how the people
like seeing you and Eurydice together.</i>

468
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,020
<i>You go, boy!</i>

469
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,420
<i>You ride that horse and by Zeus I say,
you can rule the world.</i>

470
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,740
Bucephalus.

471
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,860
That's what I'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

472
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,780
Bucephalus and Alexander.

473
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,900
<i>Come now, let's ride together.</i>

474
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,500
He's got some Titan in him yet.

475
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,300
<i>Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!</i>

476
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,660
<i>Now, Bucephalus, show them.</i>

477
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,900
My son.

478
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,780
My son!

479
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,260
<i>You remember Prometheus...</i>

480
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,340
who stole the secret of fire
and gave it to man.

481
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,140
It made Zeus so angry...

482
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,540
<i>he chained Prometheus
to a rock in the great Caucasus...</i>

483
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,580
and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

484
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:13,860
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

485
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,260
Miserable fate.

486
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:22,740
Oedipus tore out his eyes
when he found out...

487
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,140
he'd murdered his father...

488
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:29,860
and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

489
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,100
<i>Jason...</i>

490
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,300
he went east and brought back
the Golden Fleece...

491
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,660
and married a barbarian wife, Medea.

492
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:44,300
<i>Later, when he left her
for a younger wife...</i>

493
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:48,420
Medea slaughtered
their two children in vengeance.

494
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,420
My mother would never hurt me.

495
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,740
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

496
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:20,820
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

497
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,700
<i>I'm sure you remember Achilles
from Tales of Troy.</i>

498
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,340
- He's my favorite.
- Why?

499
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,780
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

500
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,580
Because he lived without fear,
and slew Hector.

501
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,420
Some say he was a hotheaded fool...

502
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,660
who fought for himself
and not the Greeks.

503
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,420
But he was a hero, the greatest at Troy.

504
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,820
And his fate?

505
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,860
That he must die young
but with great glory.

506
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,020
Did he have a choice?

507
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:04,460
Oh, yes. He could have a long life,
but there would be no glory.

508
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,780
<i>You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.</i>

509
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,540
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

510
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,900
She makes you weak.

511
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,580
The gods have never
made it easy for man.

512
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,380
<i>Look, Herakles.</i>

513
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,780
Even after he accomplished
his 12 labors...

514
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:37,860
he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

515
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,660
Poor Herakles.

516
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,460
Great Herakles.

517
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,940
All greatness comes from loss.

518
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:53,580
<i>Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.</i>

519
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,740
When I'm king like you, Father?

520
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,700
<i>Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.</i>

521
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,820
My father threw me into battle
before I knew how to fight.

522
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,540
<i>When I killed my first man, he said:</i>

523
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,940
<i>"Now you know. "</i>

524
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:14,660
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

525
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,140
A king isn't born, Alexander.

526
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,340
He's made by steel and by suffering.

527
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,580
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

528
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,860
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

529
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,540
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

530
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:44,260
<i>No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.</i>

531
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:50,860
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

532
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,540
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

533
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,140
They make of us slaves.

534
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,100
Truth is in our hearts,
and none will tell you this but your father.

535
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,740
Men hate the gods.

536
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,300
The only reason we worship any of them
is because we fear worse.

537
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,820
What's worse?

538
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,860
The Titans.

539
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,780
If they were ever to be set free...

540
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,940
it would be a darkness
such as we have never seen before.

541
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,300
<i>Could they ever come back?</i>

542
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,620
<i>Can Zeus imprison the Titans forever
under Mount Olympus?</i>

543
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:52,180
It's said that when Zeus burned them
to dust with his lightning bolt...

544
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,100
they took the Titans' ashes
and, in a cold revenge...

545
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,820
mixed it with those of mortal men.

546
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,500
Why?

547
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,900
Who knows these things?

548
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,420
One day, things will change.

549
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,740
Men will change.

550
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,140
But first, the gods must change.

551
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,860
But all this you'll forget, Alexander.

552
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,060
That's why we call them myths.

553
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,500
We can't bear to remember them.

554
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,340
I'll remember.

555
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,940
And one day, I'll be on walls like these.

556
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,220
<i>Alexander once said to me:</i>

557
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,820
<i>"We are most alone
when we are with the myths. "</i>

558
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,020
Phalanx!

559
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,100
<i>And thus, it came to pass in a dream...</i>

560
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,340
<i>as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.</i>

561
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,260
<i>At this one glorious moment in time...</i>

562
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,660
<i>Alexander was loved by all.</i>

563
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:17,300
<i>But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...</i>

564
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,260
<i>than she was to leave.</i>

565
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,900
<i>Sikander! Sikander!</i>

566
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,340
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

567
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:49,180
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

568
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,340
<i>And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.</i>

569
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,180
<i>- Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
- Not for the men who fought, I trust.</i>

570
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:02,180
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

571
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,300
<i>Now you sound like Philip.</i>

572
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,780
Philip never saw Babylon.

573
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,460
<i>No, he didn't, Hephaistion.</i>

574
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,300
- Hello!
- Hello!

575
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,140
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

576
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,820
but whatever our differences,
know this day...

577
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,540
your father would be very proud of you.

578
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,020
Thank you, Parmenion.

579
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,300
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

580
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,620
They, too, blind me.

581
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,660
A magnificent mainland work
from the last century.

582
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,700
The golden age, Alexander. Worth much
to Athens and to our alliances.

583
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,980
Take back what is ours...

584
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,700
but spare what belongs to the Persians.

585
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:02,100
<i>Yes. We're the richest men
to walk the earth, my friends.</i>

586
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:06,980
<i>- Not if you keep giving it all away.
- The grandsons of goat herders...</i>

587
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,740
<i>we now rule 2 million square miles.</i>

588
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,740
But...

589
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,980
<i>None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.</i>

590
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,220
<i>You overvalue us.</i>

591
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,060
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

592
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,580
and I but the king of air.

593
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:33,780
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

594
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,380
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

595
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,820
Only when he's found will it be decided.

596
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,620
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

597
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,740
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

598
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,780
We must hunt Darius down.

599
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,420
- That was not your father's mission.
- And I am not my father.

600
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,540
<i>Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?</i>

601
01:04:58,740 --> 01:04:59,780
Fortune favors the bold.

602
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,540
<i>No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.</i>

603
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,340
One for every night of the year.

604
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,620
<i>How will I go back to Lysimache
after this?</i>

605
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:43,700
<i>I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.</i>

606
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,940
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

607
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,500
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

608
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,420
Bagoas, great king. Darius' boy.

609
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:51,620
<i>- Bagoas.
- Nicely gilded, Your Majesty.</i>

610
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:57,180
Most successful. He was certainly
one of the great king's favorites.

611
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,980
How old? Is great well with the years.

612
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,980
What are you now, Bagoas?
Eighteen, 19?

613
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,340
- Where does he come from?
- The north, sire.

614
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,300
From the hills near Susa.

615
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,500
<i>You speak our language.</i>

616
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,300
- Good. I'd like to learn yours.
- Is learnable, my lord.

617
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,100
So tell me, Bagoas...

618
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,580
do my eyes betray me
or do you wish to be set free...

619
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,460
to go back to your homeland?

620
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,340
All my family's long dead, great king.

621
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,220
With your permission, I will stay on.

622
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,020
Very well then, Bagoas.

623
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,900
Ptolemy, administer this.

624
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,460
And that's the same of every person
in the harem, woman and eunuch.

625
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,980
Whoever wishes to be sent home
to their families, let them.

626
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,380
What?

627
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:18,020
- Hear that, boys?
- He set us free.

628
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:55,300
Great King Alexander.

629
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,380
The princess of the thousand roses...

630
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,300
and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

631
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,700
Stateira.

632
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,900
<i>Noble Alexander...</i>

633
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,020
I come to beg for the lives...

634
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,060
of my sisters...

635
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,020
my mother, my grandmother.

636
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:33,740
<i>You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.</i>

637
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,020
He, too, is Alexander.

638
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,060
Please.

639
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,780
I plead for my family's lives.

640
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,220
<i>- Sell me as a slave, great king, but-
- Look now...</i>

641
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,500
in my eyes...

642
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,860
princess...

643
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,580
and tell me...

644
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,220
how would you like to be treated?

645
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,820
As I am...

646
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,060
a princess.

647
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,060
Then so be it.

648
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,820
<i>You and your family shall
be treated as my family.</i>

649
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,660
<i>You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.</i>

650
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,740
<i>Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?</i>

651
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,900
<i>No.</i>

652
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,940
Everything I wish...

653
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,980
<i>I have requested.</i>

654
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,780
<i>You truly are...</i>

655
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,220
<i>a queen.</i>

656
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,940
<i>Yes, she would be
a perfect match for you...</i>

657
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,540
<i>but you do nothing.</i>

658
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:59,300
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

659
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,300
at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

660
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:07,180
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

661
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,940
<i>I must watch him grow stronger.</i>

662
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:22,140
<i>I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.</i>

663
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,340
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

664
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,020
<i>They are like snakes...</i>

665
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,500
<i>and can be turned.</i>

666
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,300
<i>General Crateros.</i>

667
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,900
<i>Cassander is Antipater's son.</i>

668
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,660
<i>Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...</i>

669
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,300
<i>and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.</i>

670
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,700
But beware of men who think too much.

671
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,220
<i>They blind themselves.</i>

672
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,180
<i>Only Hephaistion do I leave out.</i>

673
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,860
<i>But all of them you make rich...</i>

674
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,900
<i>while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous poverty.</i>

675
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,740
<i>Why won't you ever believe me?</i>

676
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:15,580
<i>It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.</i>

677
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,540
<i>For they are dark, Alexander.</i>

678
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,140
So dark.

679
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,860
But in you, the son of Zeus...

680
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,900
lies the light of the world.

681
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:32,100
<i>Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...</i>

682
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,580
when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

683
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,180
shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

684
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:44,900
<i>Never will there be an Alexander like you.</i>

685
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,820
Alexander the Great.

686
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:52,380
<i>Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.</i>

687
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,780
<i>I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...</i>

688
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,060
they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

689
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,300
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

690
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Bring her, Alexander.

691
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,620
<i>- It'll give her such joy.
- Joy?</i>

692
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,780
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

693
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,980
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

694
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,300
I'll take my own bath.

695
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,900
Thank you, Bagoas.

696
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,580
What bothers you?

697
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:45,340
I see in her everything I fear.

698
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:52,020
<i>Yet I have no idea what it is, this fear.</i>

699
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:00,340
She was always so sure
I was born of Zeus.

700
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,980
Why, Hephaistion?

701
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:09,660
I think there are things
beyond our imagining...

702
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:15,460
like the lightning,
tales of strange conceptions.

703
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,860
I don't doubt it.

704
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,340
What is being told me?

705
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,420
What destiny do we-? Do I have?

706
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:32,580
Well, if I'm Patroclus, I die first.

707
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,780
Then you, Achilles.

708
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,380
The generals are upset.

709
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,940
<i>They question your obsession
with Darius.</i>

710
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,300
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

711
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,980
<i>Naturally.</i>

712
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,500
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

713
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,980
I've seen it now 1000 times,
on 1000 faces.

714
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,260
These people want...

715
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,300
<i>Need change.</i>

716
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:12,660
- Aristotle was wrong about them.
- How so?

717
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,980
<i>Look at those we've conquered.</i>

718
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,260
They leave their dead unburied.

719
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,100
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

720
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,540
They mate in public.

721
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:27,580
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

722
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:32,380
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

723
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:35,620
They can soldier or work in the cities.

724
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:40,020
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

725
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,460
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

726
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,820
and the people.

727
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:50,460
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

728
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:54,500
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

729
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:59,020
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

730
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:04,180
To free the people of the world...

731
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:08,980
such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

732
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,780
a feat to rival Prometheus...

733
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,220
who was always a friend to man.

734
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,780
<i>Remember the fates of these heroes.</i>

735
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:22,140
- They suffered greatly.
- We all suffer.

736
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:26,140
<i>Your father, mine.</i>

737
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,020
They all came to the end of their time.

738
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:33,260
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

739
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:39,380
<i>You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men. "</i>

740
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,620
Are there no other forces?

741
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:45,660
Is there not love in your life...

742
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,060
Alexander?

743
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:57,260
What would you do if you
ever reached the end of the world?

744
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:02,340
<i>I'd turn back and conquer its opposite.</i>

745
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,580
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

746
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,300
So many years,
so many miles between you.

747
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,420
What is it you fear?

748
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,220
Who knows these things?

749
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:31,900
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

750
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,100
Which am I, Hephaistion?

751
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,380
Weak or divine?

752
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,820
All I know is...

753
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,940
I trust only you in this world.

754
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,060
I've missed you.

755
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,180
I need you.

756
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:55,900
It is you I love, Hephaistion.

757
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,460
<i>No other.</i>

758
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,140
<i>You're everything I care for...</i>

759
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,940
and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

760
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,540
<i>I'm so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.</i>

761
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,700
<i>You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.</i>

762
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,380
I'll be with you always.

763
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,100
Till the end.

764
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,980
<i>The campaign in the northeast of Persia...</i>

765
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:45,260
<i>turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.</i>

766
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,540
<i>We chased Darius towards Bactria...</i>

767
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,500
<i>but missed taking him by hours.</i>

768
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,100
He was dying when we found him, sire.

769
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:01,180
He asked for water.

770
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,700
He drank and died.

771
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:15,100
<i>The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.</i>

772
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:45,180
<i>Fully honoring his corpse...</i>

773
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,260
<i>Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...</i>

774
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:56,060
<i>crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.</i>

775
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:04,340
<i>We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...</i>

776
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,660
<i>where only legendary heroes
had once trod.</i>

777
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:14,140
<i>The surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.</i>

778
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,580
<i>In fact, we were totally lost.</i>

779
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,100
<i>Here, Alexander founded
his 10th Alexandria...</i>

780
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:27,540
<i>and settled it with veterans, their women
and any who would dare the frontier life.</i>

781
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,540
<i>Unable to accept defeat in any form...</i>

782
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:36,060
<i>Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted...</i>

783
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:40,220
<i>until the day he received the head
of his last enemy who'd surrendered.</i>

784
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:49,740
<i>For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...</i>

785
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:55,260
<i>which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.</i>

786
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:02,580
<i>It was here that he made
one of his most mysterious decisions.</i>

787
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:09,900
<i>Ten years after his mother's insistence
he marry a Macedonian...</i>

788
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,060
Through our union...

789
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:15,100
Greek and barbarian...

790
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:17,220
may be reconciled in peace.

791
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:23,060
<i>The most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.</i>

792
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,700
<i>Why?</i>

793
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:34,220
<i>Some say it was for
alliance with the tribes.</i>

794
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,300
<i>Others, the desire for a successor.</i>

795
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:45,820
<i>And yet others said
Alexander truly fell in love.</i>

796
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,940
<i>Who Roxane really was...</i>

797
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:54,900
<i>I doubt that any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes.</i>

798
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:59,260
On this glorious occasion...

799
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,740
I toast this great army
that has given so much.

800
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:08,020
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

801
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:14,420
I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

802
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,060
Praise Alexander!

803
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,220
And in honor of my bride...

804
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:28,300
my beautiful bride...

805
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:33,020
we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

806
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,700
and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

807
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,140
And what about our boys?

808
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,780
And lastly...

809
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:53,220
lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

810
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,740
that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

811
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:01,500
and military training
under our protection...

812
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:05,900
so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

813
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,540
in Asia.

814
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:29,860
<i>Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this time, a hill chief's daughter.</i>

815
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,940
<i>You call this
tribal wedding legitimate?</i>

816
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,860
<i>Do you forget my father
took a barbarian as his queen?</i>

817
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,900
<i>Yes, but few would call it
a profoundly happy marriage.</i>

818
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,340
But what's the point, Alexander?
She's your captive.

819
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,340
<i>Just take her as your concubine.</i>

820
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,380
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

821
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:53,340
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

822
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,220
<i>To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive...</i>

823
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,260
<i>is a sign of respect
for our subjects.</i>

824
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,780
It will bring us together, unify us.

825
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,420
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

826
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,860
<i>As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.</i>

827
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:11,620
<i>Never will our people
accept this girl's son as king.</i>

828
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:16,100
They'll be angry enough to find out their
husbands all have second wives in Barbaria.

829
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,580
Then they'll learn!

830
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:21,020
<i>By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.</i>

831
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,460
She'll breed a brave son.

832
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,380
Alexander!

833
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:28,620
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

834
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,940
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

835
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,620
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

836
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,420
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

837
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,220
chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

838
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,340
For what? To build roads in Asia?

839
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,940
- To give these people cities?
- And now make an army of them?

840
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:52,500
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

841
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,060
- What benefit to Macedon?
- It's far richer!

842
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,460
<i>- Look what you give them.
- With respect...</i>

843
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:01,340
had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling...

844
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,820
<i>- How dare you, Nearchus?!
- General Nearchus to you, boy.</i>

845
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:08,500
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

846
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,020
- Or any of you could've done!
- Philotas!

847
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,620
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

848
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,300
I supported you at your father's death.

849
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,340
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

850
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:29,460
and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

851
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:31,780
give us a Macedonian heir.

852
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,620
A Macedonian heir.

853
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,020
<i>- You've been heard clearly.
- But...</i>

854
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:47,740
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where I look to you...

855
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:52,740
and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

856
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,620
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

857
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,860
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

858
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,740
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

859
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:06,020
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

860
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:10,180
<i>He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.</i>

861
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:15,620
<i>He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.</i>

862
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,300
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

863
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,900
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

864
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,340
Old man...

865
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,940
we're in new worlds.

866
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,580
Alexander, be reasonable!

867
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,180
<i>Were they ever meant to be our equals?</i>

868
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,180
Share our rewards?

869
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:37,500
<i>You remember what Aristotle said.</i>

870
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:38,980
An Asian?

871
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:42,980
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

872
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,180
- Aristotle be damned!
- Alexander!

873
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:46,860
By Zeus and all the gods...

874
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:51,180
<i>what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?</i>

875
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:55,860
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

876
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:59,020
Alexander.

877
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:06,380
<i>What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.</i>

878
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:13,180
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

879
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,460
Five to any man
who bothers to kill me.

880
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:51,020
<i>Have another drink, Cleitus.</i>

881
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:54,820
<i>- Shouldn't you be bound to a king?
- Cleitus.</i>

882
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:59,740
Alexander, you look weak
when you not accept these honors.

883
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,020
I understand, my dear father...

884
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,900
- But it's against Greek ways.
- Then Greek ways are weak.

885
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,700
I still think she got the better of him
in this bargain.

886
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:12,100
<i>My daughter, Roxane...</i>

887
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,340
she shall make you good wife.

888
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,900
She shall kill for you.

889
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:26,460
<i>Raw skunk, ruler of heaven...</i>

890
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,660
and earth.

891
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:38,980
In honor of this great alliance...

892
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:44,420
I, Oxyartes, offer you these great gifts.

893
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:47,500
I would like to honor a toast
to you from my people.

894
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,100
Good morning, sire.

895
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,900
We shall fight for you, Alexander.

896
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,900
It shall be bloody.

897
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,660
Who's the bear?

898
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,020
Parmenion.

899
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:31,420
<i>You've been in complete control
of your supply lines.</i>

900
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,860
His pessimism is infectious.

901
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,260
But he'll stay loyal...

902
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:40,260
as long as his son remains with us.

903
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,300
Hey!

904
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:10,500
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

905
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:14,100
Perhaps too much.

906
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,780
In the ways of my country...

907
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:24,900
those who love too much
lose everything...

908
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:28,780
and those who love with irony...

909
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,460
last.

910
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,260
I found it in Egypt.

911
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,340
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

912
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,380
when man worshipped sun and stars.

913
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,500
I'll always think of you...

914
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:44,580
as the sun, Alexander.

915
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:48,780
And I pray your dream
will shine on all men.

916
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,860
I wish you a son.

917
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:04,060
<i>You're a great man.</i>

918
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:11,460
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep...

919
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:29,780
<i>You...</i>

920
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,420
love him?

921
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,540
He is Hephaistion.

922
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,060
Thank you, Bagoas.

923
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,620
<i>Your boy?</i>

924
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,260
<i>There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.</i>

925
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,300
<i>Come.</i>

926
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,660
<i>No.</i>

927
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,220
<i>No, no.</i>

928
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,980
<i>No. No.</i>

929
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,540
<i>You have no fear.</i>

930
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,940
It's fitting.

931
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:36,660
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

932
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,860
and finds her.

933
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:57,860
The myth becomes real.

934
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:13,020
Great man, Sikander...

935
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,820
you I kill now.

936
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,020
Do it.

937
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:25,140
End it. I would do the...

938
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:29,780
I would do the same.
I'll die a fool...

939
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:33,380
for this love.

940
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:22,700
My life is now yours.

941
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:50,780
<i>You will have my son.</i>

942
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:52,340
<i>Who is this woman you call your queen,
Alexander? A hill girl?</i>

943
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,660
<i>You with your breeding.</i>

944
01:39:55,820 --> 01:40:00,860
Already she makes enemies
with her strong, clumsy nature.

945
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,580
Do not confuse us.

946
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:10,500
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

947
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:13,340
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

948
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:17,300
<i>Zeus is your father.</i>

949
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:23,340
Oh, I understand she brings
you some happiness...

950
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,420
but how can she help you?

951
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:29,580
<i>You must know that
she does not speak in your name...</i>

952
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:33,780
which is yours and yours alone.

953
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:36,980
Preserve it, secret it...

954
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:40,260
and hear me when I tell you,
act...

955
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,340
and act soon.

956
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,500
<i>After seven years, people wonder:</i>

957
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,980
"Who is this King Alexander?"

958
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:52,940
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

959
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,100
<i>Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.</i>

960
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:59,100
<i>Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.</i>

961
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,860
<i>But do not chase your dream...</i>

962
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,100
<i>further east.</i>

963
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:08,060
<i>Your life and mine depend on it.</i>

964
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:10,620
<i>Remember...</i>

965
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:14,500
my only thoughts are of you.

966
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:18,980
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

967
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:21,260
<i>Think kindly of your mother.</i>

968
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,980
<i>Provide for me.</i>

969
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,740
<i>Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.</i>

970
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,860
And remember always...

971
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,460
it is I who love you more than any.

972
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:44,060
If only you were not a pale reflection...

973
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,660
of my mother's heart.

974
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:09,180
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

975
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:13,500
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

976
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,300
and when her first son is born...

977
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:21,980
her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

978
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,580
with himself as regent.

979
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,700
And you...

980
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:30,940
you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

981
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:33,700
<i>against some monstrous Northern tribe...</i>

982
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:39,340
to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

983
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:43,380
<i>And I, no longer queen,
will be put to death...</i>

984
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:47,620
with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

985
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:52,580
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

986
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:57,460
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

987
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,420
The only way is to strike.

988
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:04,340
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

989
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:09,180
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

990
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:12,700
and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

991
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:15,060
There is still Kynnane.

992
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:20,700
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

993
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:23,660
Say nothing more of my father.

994
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:26,820
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

995
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,420
<i>You're right.</i>

996
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,500
Forgive me.

997
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,500
A mother loves too much.

998
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:44,340
Who shall I sing to sleep
at night anymore?

999
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,460
I wish-I wish we could spend
more time together.

1000
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:59,660
<i>Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.</i>

1001
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,060
There's never been time, Mother.

1002
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:12,820
Since I was a child, I've been groomed
to be ever the best.

1003
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:18,300
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

1004
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,980
cursed by your greatness.

1005
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,580
<i>Yes. Take my strength.</i>

1006
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:37,580
<i>You must never confuse your feelings...</i>

1007
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:40,860
with your duties, Alexander.

1008
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:45,740
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

1009
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:49,340
I know, but you will be 19 this summer...

1010
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:54,260
<i>and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.</i>

1011
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:57,900
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

1012
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:02,260
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

1013
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:07,900
Hephaistion loves me,
as I am...

1014
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:10,180
not who.

1015
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:15,140
<i>Loves? Loves?</i>

1016
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,700
In the name of Dionysus...

1017
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:27,500
understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

1018
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:31,620
<i>Your life hangs in the balance.</i>

1019
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:37,900
<i>I know these things, Alexander.
You are nothing to him.</i>

1020
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:42,700
His spies are inside your closest circle...

1021
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,460
to ensure that
you don't plot against him.

1022
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:49,660
And still you sleep.

1023
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:54,780
<i>You will not live out this year
unless you act!</i>

1024
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,420
Stop!

1025
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,500
I'm his only worthy son.

1026
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,660
<i>You crazed woman.</i>

1027
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,780
He'd never hurt me.

1028
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:12,660
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

1029
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:16,260
<i>Yes, and you would be 40.</i>

1030
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:22,820
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

1031
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:29,340
<i>Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.</i>

1032
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:33,340
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

1033
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,020
<i>Never.</i>

1034
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,380
What would you have me do?

1035
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,980
Whatever is necessary.

1036
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:49,020
Where have you lost your mind?

1037
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,860
It would be civil war,
clan against clan, chaos.

1038
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,940
<i>Yes. And you would win.</i>

1039
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:57,740
Because the young ones
love you like a god.

1040
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,220
I forbid you to ever talk to me like that!

1041
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:03,620
Such a man would be forever chased
by the Furies!

1042
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:07,420
What have you to fear from the Furies...

1043
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:10,740
for killing an impostor to the throne...

1044
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:14,500
before he murders you
and your mother?

1045
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:17,380
Why won't you ever believe me?

1046
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:21,180
Philip did not want you.

1047
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,660
<i>You had a condition of the breathing...</i>

1048
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,260
and he wanted to leave you
in the mountains...

1049
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,540
for the birds to peck at your eyes.

1050
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:33,100
What you don't know, my poor child.

1051
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:36,060
<i>Lanice knows nothing of this.</i>

1052
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:37,500
<i>Lanice.</i>

1053
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,820
I was there.

1054
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:43,620
<i>Lanice was not.</i>

1055
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:46,260
<i>No, Alexander...</i>

1056
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:49,940
Zeus is your father.

1057
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:55,460
I laid with him that night in the wind,
as sure as any mortal man.

1058
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:59,220
<i>Never have I been made love to
as I was then.</i>

1059
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:00,780
Enough.

1060
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:05,420
Half the mothers in Greece
share such a fantasy.

1061
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,940
I warn you, Mother.

1062
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:10,260
Make no mistake.

1063
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:15,700
<i>You will treat this girl as nothing
more important than his other wives.</i>

1064
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:19,340
<i>You will behave as we always have.</i>

1065
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:21,260
As the first.

1066
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:33,580
I wonder...

1067
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,420
did you ever love him?

1068
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,740
What?

1069
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:46,180
I never stopped.

1070
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,380
What is it, Orestes?

1071
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,260
I beg your forgiveness, my king.

1072
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,420
I cannot be part of this.

1073
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,820
Who did this?

1074
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,340
Tell me.

1075
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,740
- Say it!
- Hermolaus!

1076
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:57,940
Death to all tyrants.

1077
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,380
I didn't do this!

1078
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:07,220
I've known you and loved you
as long as I know.

1079
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,060
<i>Never will you find a man
as devoted as I.</i>

1080
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:13,820
<i>The conspiracy, such as it was...</i>

1081
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:16,420
<i>deeply upset Alexander.</i>

1082
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:20,500
<i>Not only because it involved
the young people who shared his dream...</i>

1083
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:26,340
<i>but more intimately, it implicated
Philotas, his companion from boyhood...</i>

1084
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:31,500
<i>when a page confessed that a few days
before, he'd informed Philotas...</i>

1085
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,620
<i>- Alexander.
- Of the plot.</i>

1086
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,020
<i>Remember me for who I am.</i>

1087
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:43,820
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

1088
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:49,460
And it appears to me and others here
from the testimony given by your mistress...

1089
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:53,460
that the true weather of your soul
is ambition.

1090
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:55,500
<i>No.</i>

1091
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:59,420
<i>We all felt there was more here
than sexual bickering.</i>

1092
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:04,220
<i>Alexander wanted the truth and
Philotas' answers were lacking merit.</i>

1093
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,540
Please take him away.

1094
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:09,980
<i>Alexander put him silently and quickly
to trial by his peers...</i>

1095
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:14,140
<i>and whether plotter or opportunist,
Philotas was found guilty of treason.</i>

1096
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,140
<i>- No, Alexander, no!
- Remove him.</i>

1097
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:19,180
<i>The suspects were all executed.</i>

1098
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:22,060
<i>None of us defended Philotas...</i>

1099
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:25,620
<i>but then again,
none of us ever liked him.</i>

1100
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:35,300
<i>And of course his power
was carved up by the rest of us.</i>

1101
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:39,340
<i>Before he died, we tortured him...</i>

1102
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,700
<i>to find out what
his father Parmenion knew.</i>

1103
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:45,060
<i>But this we never learned.</i>

1104
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:49,220
<i>What to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our supply lines...</i>

1105
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:53,060
<i>was a far more delicate matter.
Was he innocent in this?</i>

1106
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:58,380
<i>Or had he decided to act before
age further withered his power?</i>

1107
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:02,060
- The men will follow their king.
- Alexander won't be there.

1108
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:06,660
<i>Necessity required Alexander to act...</i>

1109
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:11,740
<i>and he sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.</i>

1110
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:17,020
<i>Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.</i>

1111
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:19,020
<i>And go quickly.</i>

1112
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:26,460
<i>Three days' hard riding
sent Antigonus and Cleitus...</i>

1113
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:31,660
<i>to Parmenion, the general
most loyal to Philip.</i>

1114
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:41,460
<i>His soldiers accepted the finding of guilt
against Parmenion...</i>

1115
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:44,140
<i>as they understood well
the code of vengeance...</i>

1116
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:49,180
<i>that made the head of family
responsible for the behavior of all.</i>

1117
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:55,660
<i>Many of us felt we were better off
without that pompous thorn, Parmenion...</i>

1118
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:00,980
<i>as Alexander promoted all of us
generously.</i>

1119
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:20,300
If we issue the gold bullion in the name
of Alexander then we meet a resistance.

1120
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,740
<i>Cleitus. Antigonus.</i>

1121
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,540
Parmenion.

1122
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:41,380
<i>Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.</i>

1123
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,940
<i>If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.</i>

1124
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:51,620
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

1125
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:55,260
and that's the taste of a new woman.

1126
01:55:55,420 --> 01:56:00,260
<i>You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.</i>

1127
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:02,580
- Pausanias, you bore me.
- Alexander!

1128
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:05,780
- Be gone with you.
- Alexander, I found you the right girl.

1129
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:08,220
- What's your name, darling?
- Antigone.

1130
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,380
- What's your name?
- Antigone.

1131
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:15,500
<i>- I love you.
- And I love you, Cleitus.</i>

1132
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,940
- Please, no!
- There you go.

1133
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:24,900
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

1134
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:27,940
While alive, I prefer dancing.

1135
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,620
Pausanias.

1136
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,140
Who's your new friend?

1137
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:34,500
- There's your new friend.
- Please don't!

1138
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:38,220
<i>Don't! Please, no! No.</i>

1139
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:48,660
A toast.

1140
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:50,780
A toast!

1141
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:56,660
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

1142
01:56:56,820 --> 01:57:02,740
<i>Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!</i>

1143
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:11,660
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

1144
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:14,820
<i>Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!</i>

1145
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:22,260
And last, I drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

1146
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:25,540
<i>a Macedonian queen
we can be proud of!</i>

1147
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:31,820
To Philip and Eurydice...

1148
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,260
and to their legitimate sons!

1149
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:38,460
Don't!

1150
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:41,580
<i>What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.</i>

1151
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:55,060
What a disgrace.

1152
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:56,220
Shut up!

1153
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:58,900
- Shut up, all of you!
- Please.

1154
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:02,020
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

1155
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:04,140
Insolent pup.

1156
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,660
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

1157
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:10,980
<i>You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.</i>

1158
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:14,540
<i>- And I dishonor you?
- You listen like your mother.</i>

1159
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,740
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

1160
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:19,620
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

1161
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:23,020
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

1162
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:26,220
<i>- You insult me!
- I insult you!</i>

1163
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:29,380
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

1164
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:32,580
<i>- You dog, questioning your queen.
- Shame?</i>

1165
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:40,220
I'll marry the girl if I want,
and I'll have as many sons as I want.

1166
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:42,980
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

1167
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:44,940
Why, drunken man, must you think...

1168
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:47,580
everything I do and say
comes from my mother?

1169
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:50,700
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

1170
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:53,060
and I see her in your eyes.

1171
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:55,780
<i>You covet this throne too much.</i>

1172
01:58:57,060 --> 01:59:02,460
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

1173
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:04,860
Well, you can both dream, boy.

1174
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:08,100
<i>Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. It'll wait.</i>

1175
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:09,860
<i>Now!</i>

1176
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,940
I command you.

1177
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:17,260
Apologize to your kinsman.

1178
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,620
Apologize.

1179
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:29,340
<i>No kinsman to me.</i>

1180
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:34,860
Good night, old man.

1181
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:40,820
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

1182
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,300
<i>You bastard!</i>

1183
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,820
<i>You'll obey me. Come here.</i>

1184
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:13,380
This is the man who is going to
take you from Greece to Persia?

1185
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:16,020
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

1186
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:20,300
<i>Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!</i>

1187
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:24,380
<i>Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.</i>

1188
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:27,540
<i>You're no son of mine!</i>

1189
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:15,420
<i>In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 150,000...</i>

1190
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:18,620
<i>across the passes of the Hindu Kush...</i>

1191
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:21,180
<i>into the unknown.</i>

1192
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:27,260
<i>In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.</i>

1193
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:29,340
<i>We were now a mobile empire...</i>

1194
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:33,380
<i>stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.</i>

1195
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:36,260
<i>Cooks and architects,
doctors, surveyors...</i>

1196
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:38,060
<i>moneylenders and wives...</i>

1197
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:41,100
<i>children, lovers, whores.</i>

1198
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,020
<i>And slaves...</i>

1199
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:47,860
<i>that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.</i>

1200
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:51,860
<i>Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...</i>

1201
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:57,340
<i>no occupied territory
remained the same again.</i>

1202
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:02,700
<i>Although devoted to Roxane...</i>

1203
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,980
<i>Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...</i>

1204
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:11,260
<i>as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...</i>

1205
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:15,300
<i>wounding Alexander's great pride.</i>

1206
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:19,220
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

1207
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:20,620
In one of those caves.

1208
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:25,340
<i>They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.</i>

1209
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:30,460
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

1210
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:36,540
<i>You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?</i>

1211
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:39,100
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

1212
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:41,980
That when we reach these heights...

1213
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:45,380
we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

1214
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:48,180
and the outer ocean to the east.

1215
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:57,260
But I fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

1216
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:59,580
A world of Titans.

1217
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:03,740
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

1218
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:06,140
There is no way across.

1219
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:10,900
Except to the south, into India.

1220
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:14,340
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

1221
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:16,900
We will, Alexander.

1222
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:19,740
In a few years' time, we will return.

1223
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:23,700
But first, the men must see their homes.

1224
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:27,180
Have you found your home...

1225
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:29,060
Ptolemy?

1226
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:36,940
More and more, I think
it will be Alexandria.

1227
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:41,220
Well, at least it's hot.

1228
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:43,940
And Thais...

1229
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:46,900
she loved it there.

1230
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:50,940
Women bring men home.

1231
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:56,980
<i>- I have no such feeling.
- You have Babylon, Alexander.</i>

1232
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:59,260
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

1233
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:02,180
<i>Yes, I have Babylon.</i>

1234
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:06,740
But each land, each boundary I cross...

1235
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:09,260
I strip away another illusion.

1236
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,940
I sense death will be the last.

1237
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:19,140
<i>Yet still I push harder and harder...</i>

1238
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:22,900
to reach this home.

1239
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:29,900
Where has our eagle gone?

1240
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:36,620
We must go on, Ptolemy.

1241
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,580
<i>Until we find an end.</i>

1242
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:33,660
<i>India, the land where the sun was born...</i>

1243
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:36,460
<i>fabled to be even richer than Persia...</i>

1244
02:06:36,620 --> 02:06:40,660
<i>had never been explored or conquered.</i>

1245
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:46,140
<i>From the beginning, we struggled
to unify a land without a center.</i>

1246
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:49,060
<i>Kings who conspired against one another.</i>

1247
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:53,300
<i>A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...</i>

1248
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:57,660
<i>to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.</i>

1249
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:06,060
<i>We saw things we'd never dreamed
and could hardly describe.</i>

1250
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:09,420
<i>We saw birds that could talk
and men that couldn't.</i>

1251
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:15,300
<i>Craterus, in the advance party,
fought against men with hairy skins...</i>

1252
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,940
<i>who were tiny and
lived in the tops of trees.</i>

1253
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:26,420
- Over there!
- They're animals.

1254
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:30,140
<i>Until Hephaistion convinced us
these were animals who imitated men...</i>

1255
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,380
<i>but wore their own skin.</i>

1256
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:36,620
<i>They called this tribe "monkey. "</i>

1257
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:40,260
Monkey. Monkey.

1258
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:45,060
<i>But we saw little difference with
the tribes who lived among them.</i>

1259
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:50,180
<i>- Look at his hand.
- It's so much like ours.</i>

1260
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:55,100
Hello, little man.

1261
02:07:55,980 --> 02:08:00,900
<i>- Do they speak?
- No, but they do sing and make noises...</i>

1262
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:03,180
from the roofs of the forest.

1263
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:09,020
<i>We saw men
who walked naked in public...</i>

1264
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:13,380
<i>and spent hours at a time
staring and doing nothing.</i>

1265
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:16,820
<i>Some who lived 200 years.</i>

1266
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:21,100
<i>And then, there was the rain.</i>

1267
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:30,700
<i>Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...</i>

1268
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:32,340
<i>for 60 days and nights.</i>

1269
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:35,620
Well done today.

1270
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:40,060
Make sure the women and children
are fed.

1271
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:47,940
<i>You know better, Machatas.</i>

1272
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,900
What's your son going to say?

1273
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:55,700
<i>Come on, man.
The older you get, the stronger.</i>

1274
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:59,380
<i>Right, my king.
You're my horse, Alexander.</i>

1275
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:01,860
I'll be with you at your side.

1276
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:06,140
<i>Everything rotted in this rain...</i>

1277
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:10,540
<i>and scores of men died miserably
from the tiny serpents...</i>

1278
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:14,420
<i>that were everywhere in this evil land.</i>

1279
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:17,900
- What happened?
- It's to the neck.

1280
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:20,500
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

1281
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,220
Hold on. Hold on.

1282
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:28,260
Be brave.

1283
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:30,460
Oh, Zeus.

1284
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:35,620
<i>Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...</i>

1285
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:38,220
<i>there was none to be had.</i>

1286
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,700
<i>Tempers worsened.</i>

1287
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:43,820
<i>We massacred all Indians who resisted.</i>

1288
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:46,100
<i>And with the local water putrid...</i>

1289
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:49,020
<i>we drank the strong wine.</i>

1290
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:45,700
<i>And as we moved south and east...</i>

1291
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:50,780
<i>Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...</i>

1292
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:52,820
<i>so as to make them allies.</i>

1293
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:55,980
<i>But this did not sit well with the army...</i>

1294
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:57,420
<i>who began to wonder:</i>

1295
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:01,340
<i>Were we here for riches?
Or had Alexander...</i>

1296
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:05,900
<i>in some remorseless and crazed quest
to imitate the glory of Herakles...</i>

1297
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:07,580
<i>forgotten them?</i>

1298
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:11,740
<i>One thing an army
knows quickly in their bones...</i>

1299
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:14,340
<i>is which way the gods are blowing.</i>

1300
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:44,260
Kiss him!

1301
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:11,420
- To Bagoas.
- To Bagoas!

1302
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:21,060
- And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
- Dionysus!

1303
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:25,540
Who, we're told by our Indian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

1304
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:28,500
some 6000 years ago.

1305
02:13:28,660 --> 02:13:30,100
To a hero.

1306
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:32,260
To a hero!

1307
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:53,460
<i>Roxane.</i>

1308
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:02,780
<i>You lose face.</i>

1309
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:04,460
These Indians...

1310
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:06,380
they are a low, evil people.

1311
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:08,980
<i>You don't try to understand them.</i>

1312
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:11,460
I try.

1313
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:14,620
But this I know, Alexander.

1314
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:17,860
In Persia, you are a great king.

1315
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:19,780
Here...

1316
02:14:19,940 --> 02:14:21,900
they hate you.

1317
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:27,900
<i>Let us go back to Babylon.</i>

1318
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:30,580
There, you are strong.

1319
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:35,100
We'll talk about this later.

1320
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:36,740
<i>Yes.</i>

1321
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:38,460
<i>Later.</i>

1322
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:40,140
Talk.

1323
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,940
I shall come.

1324
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:46,340
Tonight.

1325
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:49,220
And I shall wait.

1326
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:53,180
Good night, my king.

1327
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:56,860
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

1328
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:01,660
<i>Come, Alexander, drink with us.</i>

1329
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:07,140
- Alexander.
- Alexander!

1330
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:13,860
I remember a time
you hated how your father drank.

1331
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:16,020
<i>Now I know why.</i>

1332
02:15:17,620 --> 02:15:21,620
Dionysus is hero.

1333
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:26,460
But he is also mind breaker.

1334
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:29,980
He destroys our self-control.

1335
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:34,060
Self-control is a lover
I've known too long, Ptolemy.

1336
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:40,380
The struggle worries me to the bone.

1337
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:44,660
And success I find to be
as corrupt as failure.

1338
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:50,060
But Dionysus,
bless his ancient soul...

1339
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:52,980
frees me from myself.

1340
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:56,940
And then, I move up.

1341
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:02,580
I'm simply, Alexander.

1342
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:08,620
A toast to Bagoas.

1343
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:14,900
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

1344
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:17,580
we're training to fight
in this great army.

1345
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:22,580
And to the memory of Philip.

1346
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:25,700
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

1347
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:28,900
transformed into such...

1348
02:16:29,060 --> 02:16:30,660
a pretty army.

1349
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:34,260
To Philip.

1350
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:36,540
To a real hero.

1351
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:38,980
Philip!

1352
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:46,580
<i>To Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.</i>

1353
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:48,380
<i>Cleitus.</i>

1354
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:52,500
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

1355
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:55,700
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

1356
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:58,020
after 30 years' service.

1357
02:16:58,220 --> 02:16:59,900
Exile?

1358
02:17:00,180 --> 02:17:01,940
<i>From where, Cleitus?</i>

1359
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:04,820
From my home, Alexander, Macedonia.

1360
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:08,660
<i>You could've asked me where I
wanted to spend the rest of my life.</i>

1361
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:12,900
<i>You call governing
this major province exile?</i>

1362
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:16,180
<i>Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...</i>

1363
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:19,100
a province so far from home?

1364
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:22,700
<i>Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?</i>

1365
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:27,580
So be it.

1366
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:31,380
<i>Let me rot in Macedonian rags...</i>

1367
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,660
rather than shine...

1368
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:35,980
in Eastern pomp.

1369
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:40,260
<i>I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.</i>

1370
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:44,500
<i>Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.</i>

1371
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:49,540
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

1372
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:54,580
<i>Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...</i>

1373
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:57,780
bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

1374
02:17:57,980 --> 02:18:00,700
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

1375
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,940
<i>You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?</i>

1376
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:09,300
Only when offered.

1377
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:12,300
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

1378
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:15,020
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

1379
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:17,980
<i>You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...</i>

1380
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:19,740
but a son of Zeus.

1381
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:23,500
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

1382
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:26,740
Why not?

1383
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:31,780
I've achieved more in my years.

1384
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:33,500
Traveled as far.

1385
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:34,740
Probably farther.

1386
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:37,180
Herakles did it by himself.

1387
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:40,460
<i>Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?</i>

1388
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:42,380
Who planned the Asian invasion...

1389
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:46,380
<i>when you were still being spanked
on your bottom by my sister Lanice?</i>

1390
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:48,460
Was it not your father?

1391
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:50,620
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

1392
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:54,660
<i>- Zeus-Amon, is it?
- You insult me, Cleitus.</i>

1393
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:57,460
<i>You mock my family. Be careful.</i>

1394
02:18:57,980 --> 02:19:01,420
<i>Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...</i>

1395
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:04,220
<i>asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.</i>

1396
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:06,340
Are we not good enough any longer?

1397
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,580
I remember a time...

1398
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:11,500
when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

1399
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:14,420
<i>None of this scraping, groveling.</i>

1400
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:17,220
I remember a time when we hunted...

1401
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:20,420
when we wrestled
on the gymnasium floor.

1402
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:22,460
<i>Now you kiss them?</i>

1403
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:29,140
<i>Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?</i>

1404
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:35,420
<i>Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.</i>

1405
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:42,740
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

1406
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:47,500
This army...
This army is your blood, boy!

1407
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:49,740
Without it, you're nothing!

1408
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:58,220
<i>You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!</i>

1409
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:01,420
- Get him from my sight!
- I don't serve your purpose?!

1410
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:05,300
What was I serving when I saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

1411
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:08,980
Were you Zeus' boy?
What if I left you to die in the dust there?

1412
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:12,740
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

1413
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:14,140
Alexander!

1414
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:17,860
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

1415
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:24,020
- I'll go with him.
- Alexander.

1416
02:20:24,220 --> 02:20:25,820
<i>- Who's with him?
- No.</i>

1417
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:27,540
Who's with him?

1418
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:30,340
I call Father Zeus to witness.

1419
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,820
I call you to trial before him!

1420
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:35,460
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

1421
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:38,180
- Take him!
- In the name of the gods, get him out!

1422
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:42,460
<i>Now look at you!
Great white ass, Alexander.</i>

1423
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:44,420
Hiding behind his fairy god!

1424
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:50,340
Or are you too great to remember
whose life was saved by me?!

1425
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:56,380
- I am more a man than you'll ever be! Ever!
- Get him out!

1426
02:20:57,220 --> 02:21:01,220
- He's gone. He's gone.
- Alexander.

1427
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:02,580
<i>Come on!</i>

1428
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:07,860
What a tyrant you are!
An evil tyrant you've become, Alexander.

1429
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:11,060
<i>You speak of plots against you?
What about poor Parmenion?</i>

1430
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:12,660
Get out!

1431
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:15,580
<i>He served you well.
Look how you repaid him.</i>

1432
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:18,540
<i>You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?</i>

1433
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:22,620
<i>You ungrateful wretch! No one, not my
vilest enemy, has spoken like you to me.</i>

1434
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:26,020
Getting what I say?!
Despot. False king.

1435
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:30,180
<i>You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.</i>

1436
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,540
<i>Cleitus.</i>

1437
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,380
<i>Oh, my Cleitus. Cleitus.</i>

1438
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:07,740
<i>- Let me pass.
- None can enter.</i>

1439
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:09,820
<i>I am the queen.</i>

1440
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:20,060
I want to see him.
I've waited three days.

1441
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:22,940
He says none, not even you.

1442
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:27,980
<i>- He needs me.
- No, he doesn't.</i>

1443
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:29,900
And he needs you?

1444
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:33,340
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.

1445
02:22:37,060 --> 02:22:41,100
<i>The army grows restless, questioning.</i>

1446
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:44,060
Alexander.

1447
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:48,500
They need your reassurance.

1448
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:51,340
Heinous.

1449
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:55,340
<i>Like an old lover they forgive,
but they will never forget.</i>

1450
02:22:55,740 --> 02:23:00,420
- He was an aging drunk.
- He was my friend.

1451
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:05,140
<i>His sister Lanice nursed me.</i>

1452
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:08,220
And how did I repay her?

1453
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:13,100
Two brothers dead,
fighting him by my own hands.

1454
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:15,740
Her last remaining blood.

1455
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:23,380
What will she do but weep
on the day of my birth?

1456
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:27,140
<i>Come. You know more than any...</i>

1457
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:32,100
great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted.

1458
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:34,180
<i>You're Alexander.</i>

1459
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:37,100
Pity and grief will only destroy you.

1460
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:40,900
Have I become so arrogant
that I am blind?

1461
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:49,180
Sometimes, to expect
the best of everyone is...

1462
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:50,820
<i>arrogance.</i>

1463
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:57,740
<i>Then Cleitus spoke true.
I have become a tyrant.</i>

1464
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:00,100
<i>No.</i>

1465
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:04,700
But perhaps a stranger.

1466
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:07,740
<i>You've gone too far.</i>

1467
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:12,580
They don't understand you anymore.

1468
02:24:14,380 --> 02:24:18,380
They speak of Philip now...

1469
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:22,460
as if I were a passing cloud...

1470
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:24,740
soon to be forgotten.

1471
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:28,700
I've failed...

1472
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:30,580
utterly.

1473
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:34,540
<i>You're mortal.</i>

1474
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:36,940
And they know it.

1475
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:41,420
And they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves.

1476
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:45,020
Philip once said...

1477
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:49,620
that there's a Titan in all of us.

1478
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:53,620
That they wait, mixed in our ashes.

1479
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:01,460
It wasn't because of the wine, I killed.

1480
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:04,380
It was because I wanted to.

1481
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:35,740
Philip, King of Macedonia...

1482
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:37,820
and leader of the Greeks.

1483
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:43,540
All my life, I've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

1484
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:46,940
Today is that day.

1485
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:54,180
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

1486
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:58,220
but Alexander is simply great."

1487
02:25:59,780 --> 02:26:02,460
But if you ever insult me again...

1488
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:04,260
I'll kill you.

1489
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:11,820
I've missed you.

1490
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:14,540
In the spring, Persia.

1491
02:26:14,740 --> 02:26:16,980
<i>You'll command my horse from the right.</i>

1492
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:19,380
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

1493
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:21,300
for all the gold in the world.

1494
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:23,580
Which, one day, you'll have.

1495
02:26:40,580 --> 02:26:43,020
Making himself a 13th god.

1496
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:47,420
He's drunk so much wine,
my poor Philip, he's lost his mind.

1497
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:53,380
<i>- Your Majesty.
- Attalus.</i>

1498
02:26:57,900 --> 02:27:00,780
<i>I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...</i>

1499
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:03,860
as much as our regent.

1500
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:05,540
He's very tired.

1501
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:12,060
Hey.

1502
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:17,540
<i>- Pausanias, bring the rest of the guard.
- Royal guard!</i>

1503
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:20,500
To the arena! March!

1504
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:23,580
<i>No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?</i>

1505
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:27,140
<i>- Greeks all over the place.
- Cleitus, Cleitus.</i>

1506
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:29,340
<i>My Cleitus.</i>

1507
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:32,460
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

1508
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,500
Treat him as you would me.

1509
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:36,860
He'll guard your back for you.

1510
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:39,220
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

1511
02:27:39,380 --> 02:27:42,260
My people are guard enough today.

1512
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:45,900
<i>Let these Greeks see for themselves
how I can walk through my people.</i>

1513
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:47,620
Then let them call me tyrant.

1514
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:51,460
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

1515
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:55,300
<i>Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.</i>

1516
02:27:55,460 --> 02:27:57,460
I want them to like me.

1517
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:07,300
Weren't you told? I go in alone.

1518
02:28:07,460 --> 02:28:09,460
Follow with the main guard.

1519
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:11,060
Go on.

1520
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:17,460
- Go on.
- Father, it's best I go with you.

1521
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:22,820
<i>You want the world to see
you're my successor.</i>

1522
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:24,940
Is that what she wants?

1523
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:28,140
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

1524
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:32,540
<i>You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.</i>

1525
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:38,460
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

1526
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:41,180
obey me this once!

1527
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:45,140
Have courage, Father.

1528
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:47,780
<i>And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...</i>

1529
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:50,140
you may recall your valor.

1530
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:29,820
And now, our beloved King Philip...

1531
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:33,180
in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

1532
02:29:51,060 --> 02:29:53,460
Pausanias, I told you...

1533
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:03,660
Who's your new friend?

1534
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:05,580
There's your new friend.

1535
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:09,300
<i>No! Please, don't! No!</i>

1536
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:51,340
The king lives!

1537
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:54,780
Alexander, son of Philip!

1538
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:57,580
May the gods bless the king!

1539
02:32:01,220 --> 02:32:03,980
Alexander is king!

1540
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:09,260
<i>You're king now. You're king.</i>

1541
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:12,780
<i>Long live Alexander!</i>

1542
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:18,620
- Alexander!
- King Alexander!

1543
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:22,260
Alexander!

1544
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:26,260
Alexander is king!

1545
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:33,220
May the gods bless Alexander!

1546
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:38,140
May the gods bless the king!

1547
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:40,100
Alexander!

1548
02:32:57,420 --> 02:33:00,140
<i>You break my heart, you men.</i>

1549
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:02,140
Afraid.

1550
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:05,180
Of course you have fears.

1551
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:06,780
We all have fears...

1552
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:10,100
because no one has ever
gone this far before.

1553
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:15,060
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

1554
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:16,980
We'll build a fleet of ships...

1555
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:20,100
<i>and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.</i>

1556
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:23,420
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

1557
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:26,020
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

1558
02:33:26,180 --> 02:33:29,820
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

1559
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:34,780
<i>And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.</i>

1560
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:39,500
- Follow Alexander.
- I'll follow you.

1561
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,860
What?

1562
02:33:46,060 --> 02:33:49,340
- Silence?
- We're with you, Alexander!

1563
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:51,220
<i>Crateros.</i>

1564
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:54,740
<i>Crateros.</i>

1565
02:33:54,940 --> 02:33:56,620
And another one.

1566
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:09,380
My king.

1567
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:11,500
I'm a fighting man.

1568
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:15,620
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

1569
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:19,220
I lost many a man.

1570
02:34:20,300 --> 02:34:22,940
<i>Young ones, never been with a woman.</i>

1571
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:26,260
Some died of disease.

1572
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:31,100
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

1573
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:32,980
Some died good.

1574
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:36,220
<i>Some just didn't get no luck.</i>

1575
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:38,740
But they died.

1576
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,920
Forty thousand I come over with
eight years ago.

1577
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:48,160
And we march after you
more than 10,000 miles.

1578
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:53,000
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

1579
02:34:53,160 --> 02:34:56,240
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

1580
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,400
We killed many a barbarian.

1581
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:05,920
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do I see?

1582
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:09,840
<i>Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.</i>

1583
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,560
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

1584
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:16,680
cross a hundred more rivers.

1585
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:21,640
<i>Crateros. Good Crateros.</i>

1586
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:27,640
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

1587
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:32,560
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

1588
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:38,520
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

1589
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:42,120
Aye, you have, my king,
and we love you for it.

1590
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:46,680
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

1591
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,800
<i>You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...</i>

1592
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:55,680
humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

1593
02:35:55,840 --> 02:36:02,360
is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

1594
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:06,640
before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

1595
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:14,240
<i>Yes. You're right, Crateros.</i>

1596
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:15,720
I have been negligent.

1597
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:20,720
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

1598
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:23,600
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

1599
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:28,840
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

1600
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:33,800
And respected, rich, loved.

1601
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:38,880
<i>You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...</i>

1602
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:43,240
and enjoy a peaceful death.

1603
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:46,680
But you dream, Crateros.

1604
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:51,720
<i>Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...</i>

1605
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:56,200
and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

1606
02:36:56,960 --> 02:37:02,280
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

1607
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,640
Do you not see?

1608
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:10,040
And you, as well as I, know...

1609
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:14,480
that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

1610
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:17,480
and all your great victories fade...

1611
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:23,320
it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

1612
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:26,120
For I will go on, with my Asians.

1613
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:33,920
- To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
- We come for you, and you discard us.

1614
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:36,480
- Shame!
- We want to go home, Alexander.

1615
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,400
We're tired of glory.

1616
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,480
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

1617
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:45,560
I've got children I haven't even seen.

1618
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:52,400
I want to see my children.

1619
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:56,320
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

1620
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:58,600
And all I've asked of you
is one more month.

1621
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:00,640
- Shame.
- That's your king.

1622
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:03,240
What would your father say?

1623
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:06,600
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

1624
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:10,720
So go home. I look to the
barbarians for their courage.

1625
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,600
I go east.

1626
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,800
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

1627
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:18,160
- Who said that?
- We won't make it to Macedonia.

1628
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:20,080
<i>You despicable coward. Come forth.</i>

1629
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:23,160
- Make your accusations public.
- So you can have us killed?

1630
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:26,320
- Son of Zeus.
- You desecrate your real father's memory.

1631
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:32,640
- Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
- Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

1632
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:47,520
<i>You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.</i>

1633
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:51,600
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

1634
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:55,400
<i>You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.</i>

1635
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:58,680
<i>And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.</i>

1636
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:03,880
<i>You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.</i>

1637
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:08,360
Arrest him.
After all I've done for you, you swine.

1638
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:10,440
<i>You cowards. Traitors.</i>

1639
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,360
<i>Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?</i>

1640
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:21,840
<i>In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...</i>

1641
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:27,280
<i>he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.</i>

1642
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:30,920
<i>But clearly, the army was divided.</i>

1643
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:35,920
<i>And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.</i>

1644
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:43,280
<i>He drove on, south to the outer ocean.</i>

1645
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:47,560
<i>I confess a disappointment.</i>

1646
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:51,960
<i>Especially on these reports of your
taking on Eastern ways.</i>

1647
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:57,640
<i>Beware how these manners inflame
the senses with pride.</i>

1648
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:02,240
However, I have lived long enough now...

1649
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:04,080
to question...

1650
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:09,960
when so many others invest
such emotion in their disrespect for you.

1651
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:17,160
<i>I can only hope that you continue
what you began as the boy I knew at 12.</i>

1652
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:22,200
Be that man always, Alexander,
and you will not slip.

1653
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:27,400
And perhaps you will prove
this old materialist...

1654
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:30,280
<i>as you always thought me:</i>

1655
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:33,440
A dreamer after all.

1656
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:54,360
Stay calm.

1657
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:56,520
Together we are strong as gods.

1658
02:40:58,280 --> 02:41:02,760
<i>Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.</i>

1659
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:09,000
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

1660
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:17,280
<i>Lock shields.</i>

1661
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:22,000
Battle positions.

1662
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:26,000
Move.

1663
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:37,560
<i>Choppers, prepare your knives.</i>

1664
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:39,480
Follow me.

1665
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:55,400
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

1666
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:18,120
<i>Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.</i>

1667
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:20,600
<i>Cavalry!</i>

1668
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:32,360
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

1669
02:42:51,560 --> 02:42:53,080
Hold the line.

1670
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:57,040
We must hide!

1671
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:42,240
- Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
- Follow Alexander.

1672
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:49,440
<i>Charge. Charge. Charge.</i>

1673
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:54,440
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

1674
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:57,960
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

1675
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:01,960
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

1676
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:05,320
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

1677
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:30,880
Hephaistion. To the center.

1678
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:37,160
<i>Come, Macedonians. Ride.</i>

1679
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:39,760
<i>Ride!</i>

1680
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:38,800
<i>Coenus! Get out of there.</i>

1681
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,200
<i>No.</i>

1682
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:14,680
- The horses won't go.
- On foot, then.

1683
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:25,320
Fall back, men! Fall back!

1684
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:28,200
<i>Come, Bucephalus.</i>

1685
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:35,040
Fear not, my friend.

1686
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:39,240
Bucephalus.

1687
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:41,440
'Tis only sun and shadow.

1688
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:46,120
Bucephalus and Alexander.

1689
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:47,800
One last time, it's you and me.

1690
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:53,680
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

1691
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:56,320
and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

1692
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:00,320
<i>Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?</i>

1693
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:06,320
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

1694
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:24,600
Attack.

1695
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:28,080
Alexander!

1696
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Alexander.

1697
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:15,440
- The king is down!
- To the king!

1698
02:50:39,800 --> 02:50:43,400
<i>It was the bloodiest of his battles.</i>

1699
02:50:47,320 --> 02:50:49,120
<i>Pure butchery.</i>

1700
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:56,640
<i>We'd never be men again.</i>

1701
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,960
Get out.

1702
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:19,920
Go.

1703
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:27,240
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

1704
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:29,920
Because it was meant to be.

1705
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:31,960
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

1706
02:52:32,120 --> 02:52:36,120
<i>- No one blames you.
- They blame me behind my back! In secret.</i>

1707
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:38,360
- Slander is not power.
- Shame is?

1708
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:42,880
Who killed my father?

1709
02:52:43,400 --> 02:52:45,000
Tell me.

1710
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:47,920
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

1711
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:50,640
- Pausanias.
- He had help!

1712
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:52,960
Did you help him?

1713
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:02,360
<i>No, never.</i>

1714
02:53:02,920 --> 02:53:05,760
Why? Why would I?

1715
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:08,560
So many wanted it.

1716
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:11,400
Greeks, Persians, men, women.

1717
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:14,320
I'd be shocked if there were not
a god he had not profaned.

1718
02:53:14,480 --> 02:53:16,000
How ironic though, in the end...

1719
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:19,640
a boy he rutted with once too often
returned the favor.

1720
02:53:19,880 --> 02:53:21,840
<i>You're mad. You're cursed.</i>

1721
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,680
<i>You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.</i>

1722
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:27,720
<i>Now who is exaggerating?</i>

1723
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:31,480
Even if it was the wish of your heart...

1724
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:33,800
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

1725
02:53:33,960 --> 02:53:35,880
He was not your father!

1726
02:53:36,040 --> 02:53:38,160
<i>You owe no blood debt to that man.</i>

1727
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:41,120
<i>You lie and lie and lie.</i>

1728
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:44,400
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

1729
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:48,040
<i>Look at you. Look at you.</i>

1730
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:51,600
<i>You are everything that he was not.</i>

1731
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:55,120
He was coarse, you are refined.

1732
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:59,240
He was a general, and you are a king.

1733
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:01,320
He could not rule himself...

1734
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:04,800
and you shall rule the world.

1735
02:54:04,960 --> 02:54:08,680
<i>You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.</i>

1736
02:54:08,840 --> 02:54:10,920
Such thick pride...

1737
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:12,800
and no mourning for your husband.

1738
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,400
Mourn...

1739
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:16,120
him?

1740
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:19,600
What do you know of Philip?

1741
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:25,440
<i>No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.</i>

1742
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:29,880
- Act like it.
- My first act would be to kill you!

1743
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:33,520
<i>You murdered me in my cradle.</i>

1744
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:35,920
<i>You birthed me in a sack of hate.</i>

1745
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,240
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

1746
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:42,320
- Hate you have for men.
- I taught you my heart, Alexander!

1747
02:54:42,480 --> 02:54:45,400
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

1748
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:47,760
Damn your sorceress soul.

1749
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:50,600
<i>Your soul is mine, Alexander.</i>

1750
02:54:52,080 --> 02:54:53,600
<i>No! No!</i>

1751
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:58,160
<i>You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!</i>

1752
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,800
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

1753
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:03,480
<i>You're a king. Act like one.</i>

1754
02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:05,360
Parmenion is with us, for once.

1755
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:07,400
Execute Attalus without delay.

1756
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:10,360
<i>Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.</i>

1757
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:12,120
Eurydice? Never.

1758
02:55:12,280 --> 02:55:13,680
<i>Laugh, you monster.</i>

1759
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:15,200
<i>You heartbreaker.</i>

1760
02:55:15,400 --> 02:55:18,280
How will you live out the year like this?

1761
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:23,200
- Have you learned nothing from Philip?
- No. From you, Mother.

1762
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:28,000
The best.

1763
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:42,600
What have I done
to make you hate me so?

1764
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:49,920
One day, you will understand this.

1765
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:53,560
But I have only you in my heart.

1766
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:59,560
I know what you need.

1767
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:02,640
<i>Now is the time.</i>

1768
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:05,040
The gods favor you.

1769
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:08,720
Great wealth, power, conquest.

1770
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:10,720
All you desire.

1771
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:13,520
The world is yours!

1772
02:56:13,720 --> 02:56:15,640
Take it.

1773
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:21,960
Take it.

1774
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:47,520
<i>He never saw his mother again.</i>

1775
02:56:51,160 --> 02:56:54,440
<i>And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...</i>

1776
02:56:54,600 --> 02:57:00,200
<i>Olympias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.</i>

1777
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:06,400
<i>By necessity, Alexander
had her uncle Attalus executed.</i>

1778
02:57:46,880 --> 02:57:50,480
He lives! Alexander!

1779
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:14,800
Men of Macedon...

1780
02:58:15,560 --> 02:58:17,680
we're going home.

1781
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:21,080
- What?
- What?

1782
02:58:22,160 --> 02:58:25,280
- Home?
- We're going.

1783
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:31,880
We're going home.

1784
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,080
<i>His life should have ended in India...</i>

1785
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:44,200
<i>but that's myth.</i>

1786
02:59:45,720 --> 02:59:51,160
<i>In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.</i>

1787
02:59:51,320 --> 02:59:52,600
Great Zeus...

1788
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:55,040
we have worshipped you in blood.

1789
02:59:56,200 --> 02:59:58,760
<i>Look kindly on our homeward steps...</i>

1790
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:03,360
and smile upon our backs.

1791
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:11,720
May all those who come here after us
know, when they see this altar...

1792
03:00:11,880 --> 03:00:15,560
that Titans were once here.

1793
03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:33,840
<i>Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...</i>

1794
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:38,680
<i>Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...</i>

1795
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:41,240
<i>across the great Gedrosian desert...</i>

1796
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:44,600
<i>seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.</i>

1797
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:52,320
<i>Here, he watched helplessly
the cruel breaking of his army.</i>

1798
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:54,960
<i>Not by any human foe...</i>

1799
03:00:55,440 --> 03:00:57,720
<i>but by nature.</i>

1800
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:03,440
<i>To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.</i>

1801
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:06,560
<i>It was the worst blunder of his life.</i>

1802
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:12,960
<i>And when he finally reentered Babylon,
after six years in the Far East...</i>

1803
03:01:13,120 --> 03:01:19,040
<i>Alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives.</i>

1804
03:01:19,960 --> 03:01:23,600
<i>Now Alexander had three wives,
two lovers...</i>

1805
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:26,640
<i>a contentious mother
and a turbulent Greece...</i>

1806
03:01:26,800 --> 03:01:30,160
<i>satraps of dubious loyalty
in several provinces...</i>

1807
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:33,400
<i>generals questioning his every decision.</i>

1808
03:01:33,560 --> 03:01:39,840
<i>And beneath it all, a restive new army
made up of 10 Asians for every Greek...</i>

1809
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,960
<i>all held together by one slender thread.</i>

1810
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:46,480
They took another reading.
The harbor can only be dredged to 20 feet.

1811
03:01:46,640 --> 03:01:49,680
Then get a second opinion from
the Phoenicians. It goes deeper.

1812
03:01:49,880 --> 03:01:54,760
Alexander. We'll well over 12,000 talents
on wood alone for the fleet.

1813
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:57,960
And their armor costs are staggering.

1814
03:01:59,080 --> 03:02:01,800
- Cast another dye, we shall back them.
- How?

1815
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:03,160
Our armor... Our Treasury...

1816
03:02:03,320 --> 03:02:06,200
With our future, Cassander,
the best capital we have.

1817
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:10,920
Even so, I seriously doubt the Phoenicians
can make a timber quote in time.

1818
03:02:11,080 --> 03:02:14,480
Perhaps we could sail with fewer ships
or delay until the spring...

1819
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:16,920
There'll be no delays, Nearchus.

1820
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:21,160
- Ptolemy, how goes our library?
- The trees are falling as we speak.

1821
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:23,200
Good. We must not forget our libraries.

1822
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,480
All the Alexandrias we have,
I want libraries.

1823
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:38,640
- Just last night he was...
- It's the water, Your Majesty.

1824
03:02:38,840 --> 03:02:41,200
He mixed it with the wine.

1825
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:43,760
But how can this be?

1826
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:47,920
- Typhus of India?
- I wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

1827
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:53,440
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold chicken.

1828
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:55,880
With the regimen of cares
that I've put in place...

1829
03:02:57,080 --> 03:02:58,400
<i>Come, doctor.</i>

1830
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:13,760
I feel better.

1831
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:18,080
Soon, I'll be up.

1832
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:22,600
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and I couldn't leave without you.

1833
03:03:23,600 --> 03:03:25,920
Arabia.

1834
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:34,000
<i>You used to dress me up like a sheik...</i>

1835
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:36,760
wave your wooden scimitar.

1836
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:40,040
<i>You were the only one
who'd never let me win.</i>

1837
03:03:41,840 --> 03:03:44,880
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

1838
03:03:45,360 --> 03:03:48,280
<i>You saved me from myself.</i>

1839
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:53,880
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

1840
03:04:02,560 --> 03:04:07,000
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles...

1841
03:04:07,160 --> 03:04:10,160
and then outdid him.

1842
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:12,200
And then what happened?

1843
03:04:12,400 --> 03:04:15,760
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

1844
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:22,520
- But how beautiful a myth it was.
- We reach, we fall.

1845
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:26,720
Oh, Hephaistion.

1846
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:37,920
- I worry for you without me.
- I am nothing without you.

1847
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:42,160
<i>Come, fight, Hephaistion.</i>

1848
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:45,560
We will die together.

1849
03:04:48,520 --> 03:04:54,120
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

1850
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:58,680
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

1851
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:04,120
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

1852
03:05:04,960 --> 03:05:09,480
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

1853
03:05:09,640 --> 03:05:14,560
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

1854
03:05:15,560 --> 03:05:19,440
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

1855
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:23,040
And then explore the northern forests...

1856
03:05:23,240 --> 03:05:26,400
and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

1857
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:31,240
And then one day,
populations will mix and travel freely.

1858
03:05:31,440 --> 03:05:34,120
Asia and Europe will come together.

1859
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:39,920
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

1860
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:46,280
looking out our balcony
at this new world.

1861
03:05:52,960 --> 03:05:54,680
Hephaistion?

1862
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:58,200
Hephaistion?

1863
03:05:59,800 --> 03:06:01,920
<i>No!</i>

1864
03:06:05,880 --> 03:06:10,440
- Where is this doctor?
- I can't explain this, Your Majesty.

1865
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:15,000
- It's not possible. I swear by Apollo.
- Execute him!

1866
03:06:15,960 --> 03:06:19,040
Take him out now and execute him.

1867
03:06:19,480 --> 03:06:23,680
- Come away, come away.
- Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

1868
03:06:24,400 --> 03:06:28,000
Get out. Get out now!

1869
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:43,760
Be gone with you!
Harpies! Get out! Get out!

1870
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:45,640
Are you drunk again?

1871
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:47,360
- Get out.
- He's dead.

1872
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:50,400
- Who?
- Many hated him...

1873
03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:53,360
but I don't think any other
would have dared.

1874
03:06:54,920 --> 03:06:56,960
Hephaistion is dead?

1875
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:03,080
Are you mad?

1876
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:06,520
<i>You monster.</i>

1877
03:07:07,840 --> 03:07:10,920
- Are you mad?
- You've taken from me all I've ever loved.

1878
03:07:11,080 --> 03:07:15,040
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

1879
03:07:16,120 --> 03:07:20,760
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

1880
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:25,080
- Alexander, we have a son.
- No.

1881
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:29,240
- The child.
- Oh, Your Majesty, no.

1882
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:35,800
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

1883
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,440
We have a son.

1884
03:07:38,920 --> 03:07:42,280
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

1885
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:45,640
<i>Never touch me again.</i>

1886
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:51,040
<i>No!</i>

1887
03:07:56,680 --> 03:07:59,480
One last toast!

1888
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:04,680
Before the dawn.

1889
03:08:11,720 --> 03:08:14,880
To my old friends.

1890
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:35,520
- And to the myths.
- To the myths.

1891
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:08,040
<i>Yes, come on. Finish it.</i>

1892
03:09:29,080 --> 03:09:31,200
To the next dawn.

1893
03:10:07,560 --> 03:10:09,720
My little Achilles.

1894
03:10:31,400 --> 03:10:34,440
- Bless you, Alexander.
- Lord, we love you.

1895
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:37,960
Bless you, Alexander.

1896
03:10:45,560 --> 03:10:48,480
My lord, these herbs are from Delphi.

1897
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:51,240
They saved my brother.

1898
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:53,440
- Rest yourself.
- Thank you.

1899
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:56,720
We love you, Alexander.

1900
03:11:02,240 --> 03:11:04,000
Alexander.

1901
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:07,560
Alexander.

1902
03:11:11,800 --> 03:11:14,240
We love you, Alexander...

1903
03:11:15,480 --> 03:11:17,720
and your seed.

1904
03:11:19,960 --> 03:11:22,160
Keep moving, men, please.

1905
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:29,920
<i>Yes, come.</i>

1906
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:36,640
<i>Come to Babylon. I await you.
Your only loving son.</i>

1907
03:11:42,680 --> 03:11:44,240
For the men.

1908
03:11:44,600 --> 03:11:46,160
Bagoas.

1909
03:11:52,560 --> 03:11:55,840
<i>Can you prop me up a little?
It catches me.</i>

1910
03:12:05,560 --> 03:12:07,680
I've never been so idle.

1911
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:10,880
The fleet will never get out by spring.
I must go.

1912
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:31,000
<i>You have given me all.</i>

1913
03:12:32,200 --> 03:12:35,520
- Bagoas.
- And you have given me...

1914
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:39,240
the happiest times of my life,
Alexander.

1915
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:45,200
Happy? What is happy?

1916
03:12:47,360 --> 03:12:50,720
While in your mind and body
are stretched to breaking...

1917
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:54,320
you have no thought beyond the next.

1918
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:58,120
And you look back then...

1919
03:12:58,680 --> 03:13:01,280
and there it was, happiness.

1920
03:13:02,280 --> 03:13:05,000
In the doing, never the thinking.

1921
03:13:07,240 --> 03:13:12,240
Still, you have made me so happy.

1922
03:13:20,480 --> 03:13:22,920
It is done, Bagoas.

1923
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:27,280
It is done.

1924
03:13:50,520 --> 03:13:52,760
Wait. We have his son.

1925
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:56,160
Alexander. Wait.

1926
03:13:57,360 --> 03:13:58,840
Wait.

1927
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:01,960
Vultures. Wait.

1928
03:14:02,120 --> 03:14:03,840
We have his son.

1929
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:06,960
<i>Just three more months.</i>

1930
03:14:07,120 --> 03:14:09,080
Please live.

1931
03:14:11,800 --> 03:14:14,520
Alexander, the army will divide.

1932
03:14:14,680 --> 03:14:17,800
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

1933
03:14:18,040 --> 03:14:20,480
We beg you. Tell us who.

1934
03:14:23,360 --> 03:14:25,240
Who will rule this great empire?

1935
03:14:25,400 --> 03:14:29,600
- Who do you want to, Alexander?
- We beg you, tell us.

1936
03:14:30,800 --> 03:14:32,440
<i>The myth becomes real.</i>

1937
03:14:49,400 --> 03:14:52,320
<i>Zeus is your father.</i>

1938
03:14:57,640 --> 03:14:58,920
Who will it be?

1939
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:02,760
Pray tell us, who?

1940
03:15:05,040 --> 03:15:07,680
<i>- What did he say?
- "To the best. "</i>

1941
03:15:09,840 --> 03:15:12,280
- He said, "To the best."
- What?

1942
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:14,640
- No, he said, "To Crateros."
- To Crateros?

1943
03:15:14,800 --> 03:15:16,480
Why would he say Crateros?

1944
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:23,320
<i>On the 10th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...</i>

1945
03:16:23,480 --> 03:16:27,920
<i>Alexander's great heart
finally gave out.</i>

1946
03:16:28,120 --> 03:16:32,320
<i>And as he vowed,
he joined Hephaistion.</i>

1947
03:16:35,480 --> 03:16:38,200
<i>But in his short life,
he achieved, without doubt...</i>

1948
03:16:38,360 --> 03:16:43,680
<i>the mythic glory
of his ancestor Achilles and more.</i>

1949
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:51,440
<i>Olympias' transgression
in the murder of his father...</i>

1950
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:54,440
<i>is, to my mind, a probability.</i>

1951
03:16:54,600 --> 03:16:57,160
<i>His, a burden.</i>

1952
03:16:58,960 --> 03:17:03,760
<i>Alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it.</i>

1953
03:17:07,720 --> 03:17:12,000
<i>But by blood, and blood alone,
he was guilty.</i>

1954
03:17:12,160 --> 03:17:16,520
<i>No!</i>

1955
03:17:24,560 --> 03:17:27,400
- Bolt the doors.
- The body stays in Babylon.

1956
03:17:27,560 --> 03:17:31,440
<i>- The body belongs to Macedon.
- Within hours...</i>

1957
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:35,200
<i>we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.</i>

1958
03:17:35,400 --> 03:17:40,080
<i>The wars of the world had begun.
Forty years, off and on, they endured.</i>

1959
03:17:40,240 --> 03:17:44,480
<i>Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.</i>

1960
03:17:44,680 --> 03:17:49,120
<i>Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egypt.</i>

1961
03:17:49,320 --> 03:17:52,680
<i>Until we divided his empire in four parts.</i>

1962
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:54,720
Gentlemen, we are not savages.

1963
03:17:54,880 --> 03:17:56,480
- We are the future...
- Get out!

1964
03:17:57,040 --> 03:18:00,400
<i>I think Alexander would have been
disappointed in us.</i>

1965
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:08,560
<i>Naturally, rumors grew he'd been poisoned
by one faction of his generals or another...</i>

1966
03:18:08,720 --> 03:18:14,160
<i>but the truth in these matters
has long since been driven from currency.</i>

1967
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:20,760
<i>Cassander saw to that
with his fake diaries...</i>

1968
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:25,760
<i>painting Alexander
as a sick and bloated drunk.</i>

1969
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:30,680
<i>Many believed,
to remove suspicion from himself.</i>

1970
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:38,640
He certainly proved he had the temperament
for politics and murder...

1971
03:18:38,800 --> 03:18:43,960
when seven years later,
he executed Olympias.

1972
03:18:44,920 --> 03:18:48,560
Met her death with great courage.

1973
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:54,360
<i>Five years...
No, it was six years after that...</i>

1974
03:18:54,520 --> 03:19:00,640
Cassander finally achieved the complete
destruction of Alexander's bloodline...

1975
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:03,480
when he poisoned Roxane...

1976
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:07,400
and Alexander's 13-year-old son...

1977
03:19:08,960 --> 03:19:11,760
the true heir to the empire.

1978
03:19:16,120 --> 03:19:19,600
But Roxane too, like Olympias...

1979
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:25,560
played by stern rules,
supported by several generals.

1980
03:19:25,720 --> 03:19:31,600
Days after Alexander's death,
she had Stateira poisoned.

1981
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:34,240
It was reason enough
for some to believe...

1982
03:19:34,400 --> 03:19:38,200
she was the one behind
Hephaistion's sudden demise.

1983
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:41,160
But this is unproven in my mind.

1984
03:19:41,320 --> 03:19:44,560
Bagoas disappeared
from the histories entirely...

1985
03:19:44,760 --> 03:19:47,400
a wise move, perhaps.

1986
03:19:48,240 --> 03:19:51,560
But I will say his love and devotion
for Alexander...

1987
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:56,880
were unquestionable and extraordinary.

1988
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:08,280
<i>Now I am the keeper of his body...</i>

1989
03:20:08,480 --> 03:20:11,640
embalmed here in the Egyptian ways.

1990
03:20:12,480 --> 03:20:17,960
<i>I followed him as Pharaoh,
and have now ruled 40 years.</i>

1991
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:25,720
I have two sons,
each jealous of the other's power.

1992
03:20:28,320 --> 03:20:32,480
But they will grow to make
fine fathers and husbands.

1993
03:20:32,680 --> 03:20:36,840
And I trust they'll be just in their affairs.

1994
03:20:38,400 --> 03:20:41,200
But they have never seen...

1995
03:20:41,360 --> 03:20:44,120
the great cavalry charge of Gaugamela...

1996
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:47,560
or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...

1997
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:53,560
when we crossed the 100,000 men army
into India.

1998
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:03,320
He was a god, Cadmos...

1999
03:21:04,200 --> 03:21:07,120
or as close as anything
I've ever known.

2000
03:21:07,280 --> 03:21:11,160
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. I laugh.

2001
03:21:11,320 --> 03:21:14,040
<i>No tyrant ever gave back so much.</i>

2002
03:21:14,200 --> 03:21:16,840
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

2003
03:21:17,480 --> 03:21:19,840
It takes strong men to rule.

2004
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:26,280
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

2005
03:21:27,120 --> 03:21:30,000
Before him, there were tribes...

2006
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:34,720
and after him, all was possible.

2007
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:39,640
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

2008
03:21:39,800 --> 03:21:41,960
and be better for all.

2009
03:21:44,320 --> 03:21:47,880
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built
across this world.

2010
03:21:48,040 --> 03:21:53,800
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

2011
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:58,200
It was a Hellenic civilization...

2012
03:21:58,400 --> 03:22:02,200
open to all.

2013
03:22:06,240 --> 03:22:09,880
But the truth is never simple...

2014
03:22:10,760 --> 03:22:12,840
and yet it is.

2015
03:22:13,280 --> 03:22:16,200
The truth is, we did kill him.

2016
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:23,320
By silence, we consented.

2017
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:25,760
Because...

2018
03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:28,440
Because we couldn't go on.

2019
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:33,880
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

2020
03:22:34,040 --> 03:22:39,360
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

2021
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:42,720
Mixing the races, harmony?

2022
03:22:43,720 --> 03:22:46,480
Oh, he talked of these things...

2023
03:22:46,680 --> 03:22:52,440
but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

2024
03:22:53,480 --> 03:22:56,400
I never believed in his dream.

2025
03:22:56,560 --> 03:22:58,640
<i>None of us did.</i>

2026
03:23:00,440 --> 03:23:02,720
That's the truth of his life.

2027
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:05,480
The dreamers exhaust us.

2028
03:23:06,200 --> 03:23:10,400
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

2029
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:14,640
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

2030
03:23:14,800 --> 03:23:17,240
It's an old fool's rubbish.

2031
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:24,400
<i>You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition. "</i>

2032
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:27,040
<i>Yes, great Pharaoh.</i>

2033
03:23:27,200 --> 03:23:31,160
Oh, he could have stayed home in
Macedonia, married, raised a family.

2034
03:23:32,360 --> 03:23:35,440
He'd have died a celebrated man.

2035
03:23:37,800 --> 03:23:40,560
But this was not Alexander.

2036
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:46,720
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

2037
03:23:46,880 --> 03:23:53,240
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

2038
03:23:54,640 --> 03:23:58,600
The freest man I've ever known.

2039
03:24:00,280 --> 03:24:05,280
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

2040
03:24:05,440 --> 03:24:09,160
and impatience with those
who could not understand.

2041
03:24:09,520 --> 03:24:12,200
And if his desire...

2042
03:24:12,400 --> 03:24:17,280
to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

2043
03:24:19,840 --> 03:24:23,040
What failure!

2044
03:24:23,200 --> 03:24:29,400
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

2045
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:35,800
I've lived...

2046
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:38,320
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

2047
03:24:38,480 --> 03:24:40,920
but the glory
and the memory of man...

2048
03:24:41,080 --> 03:24:46,000
will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

2049
03:24:46,480 --> 03:24:51,720
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

2050
03:24:52,920 --> 03:24:56,840
Megas Alexandros.

2051
03:24:58,280 --> 03:25:01,440
The greatest of them all.
