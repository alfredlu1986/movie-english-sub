1
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,199
Who are you?

2
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,314
You okay?

3
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,232
Don't I look okay?

4
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,997
If you were any thinner
you wouldn't exist.

5
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,235
No!

6
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,468
Trevor?

7
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,957
You still got a half-hour.

8
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,956
I could fix you some eggs.

9
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,751
I'm tired. But thanks.

10
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,195
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

11
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,751
Come on, guys. Keep it moving.

12
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,389
Yessuh, Mistah Tucker!
Mutha-Fucker.

13
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,312
Why's this machine down?

14
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,114
Maintenance.

15
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,316
Takes seven minutes
to power-up that mill.

16
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,914
Where am I gonna make up that
seven minutes, Miller?

17
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,149
- From your paycheck?
- Back off, Tucker.

18
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,311
You know
it's against regulations.

19
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,198
What "regulations"?

20
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,358
Lockout devices must be in place

21
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,353
during the cleaning and maintenance
of all heavy machinery." oSHA, 1989.

22
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,475
Yeah?

23
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,791
Write your congressman.
And hurry that up.

24
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,032
Congratulations, Reznik.

25
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,915
Youjust made my Shit List.

26
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,039
She's copping his joint.

27
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,191
He starts tellin' her
"baby this" and "baby that",

28
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,157
chattin' her up like
motherfuckin' Barry White.

29
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,389
Tellin' her what he wants to do,

30
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,471
and how he's gonna make
the coochie feel and all that.

31
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,118
- That's right.
- So dig.

32
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,954
She's stops, she looks up at him
with these big puppy dog eyes

33
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:56,397
and she's all: "that sounds good
puppy but me no have no coochie..."

34
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,870
And the brother's like:
"Say what?"

35
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,875
And he looks down
and sees that she is really a he!

36
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,154
Man, that's bullshit.

37
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,590
You telling me
the ho's wearing a thong

38
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,909
and the fool can't tell
the difference?

39
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,595
She had a tuck job, man! Come on,
Jonesy. You know how they do it!

40
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,752
- You might. I don't.
- Yeah, wathever...

41
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,387
Ei, Re<nik?
You up for some cards tonight?

42
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,709
Can't. Got plans.

43
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,951
Shit. Nigga says the same
damn thing every poker night.

44
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,349
What's up with you, man?
You used to be all right.

45
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,954
He used to hang
but he ain't been all right.

46
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,429
You may not reali<e this, but some
men prefer the company of women.

47
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,113
Who? Howdy Doody?

48
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,270
He don't get no booty.

49
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,028
Maybe he's got himself
a date with the Tuck Job.

50
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,828
Nah. Your mother said
she couldn't make it.

51
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,077
Re<nik talk...

52
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,392
You okay?

53
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,552
Don't I look okay?

54
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,357
If you were any thinner
you wouldn't exist.

55
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,152
What's wrong?

56
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,633
I don't know. Deja vu?

57
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,268
You're tired.
You need to sleep.

58
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,711
- How do you do it?
- What?

59
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,996
Sleep so little
and still look so good.

60
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,717
Are you flirting with me?

61
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,711
Commiserating.

62
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,032
- Trying to fatten me up?
- What if I am?

63
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,757
Suppose I wanted blueberry?

64
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,354
You had that last night.

65
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,070
You don't fool me, Trevor Re<nik.
I have you figured out.

66
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,592
You do, huh?

67
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,511
What else do you know about me?

68
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,111
That you're lonely.

69
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,110
When you work graveyard
as long as I have,

70
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,712
you get to know the type.

71
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,514
Hey. Everyone gets lonely, Trevor.

72
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,512
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

73
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,311
How can I be lonely
when I have you to keep me company?

74
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,311
Trevor Reznik.

75
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,354
Furman's office. Now.

76
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,117
How you doing, Re<nik?

77
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,952
What's this about?

78
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,431
Frankly, I'm concerned
about you.

79
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:02,391
To be honest,
I think you look like toasted shit.

80
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,794
I've had a lot
on my mind lately.

81
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,916
- Anything we could help with?
- No. Thanks.

82
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,388
- It's nothing I can't handle.
- Want to see the doctor?

83
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,390
That's not necessary.
I'm fine. Really.

84
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,152
Are you doin' drugs, Re<nik?

85
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,270
- Where's the shop steward?
- He couldn't make it.

86
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,634
I shouldn't even be in here
without a union rep.

87
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,278
- See what I mean?
- Look, Trevor.

88
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:29,952
I understand how you feel.
Believe me.

89
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,509
But there's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

90
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,273
- Then I'll just get back to work.
- Trevor.

91
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:36,633
Not yet.

92
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,350
I have to ask you for a U.A.

93
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,552
Looks like rain.

94
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,028
Radio says
it's a storm's on the way.

95
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,678
Guess they're right.

96
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,715
I'd say it's already here.

97
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,870
You on the 1st shift?

98
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,676
- Yeah.
- Me too.

99
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,510
That's funny.
I've never seen you before.

100
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,592
I've been here.

101
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,792
I work in the pit.

102
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,434
Just picked up Reynolds' shift.

103
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,078
Where's Reynolds?

104
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,870
Feds picked him up.

105
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,952
Old warrant.

106
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,872
I'm lvan.

107
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,389
Trevor.

108
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,433
Well,

109
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,389
I guess I better be getting back.

110
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:11,031
I hear that Tucker guy
can be a real prick.

111
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,872
You heard right.

112
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,557
I'll see you around.

113
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,472
What's wrong?

114
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,311
I just want to lie here.

115
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,557
We could do that.

116
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,357
I'm so tired.

117
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,554
You could fall asleep
if you want. Off the meter.

118
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,792
That's the problem.
I can't sleep.

119
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,311
Nothing helps.

120
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,269
Don't worry about it, honey.

121
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,120
Everyone gets insomnia
now and then.

122
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,673
Stevie.

123
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,836
I haven't slept in a year.

124
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,355
Jesus christ.

125
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,516
I tried Him, too.

126
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,038
Sorry.

127
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,394
Hello?

128
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,909
Yeah.

129
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:51,231
I can't talk right now.

130
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,953
Ok.

131
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,793
My ex.

132
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,069
He's a fucking psycho.

133
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,710
Trevor, I'm worried about you.

134
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,949
Don't worry.

135
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,999
No one ever died of insomnia.

136
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,518
I hope not.

137
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,228
You're my best client.
I can't afford to lose you.

138
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,834
Gee, thanks.

139
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,068
<i>Reznik.</i>

140
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,999
I need a hand!

141
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,152
I'm trying to get this bed
leveled here. Help me.

142
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,754
- Safety on?
- Yeah.

143
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,634
How's that?

144
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,953
No. Still off.

145
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,678
That any better?

146
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,278
Do your sleeping on your own time.
I need some help.

147
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,074
Better. But not level.
Try the other side.

148
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,951
Bitch of machine...

149
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,109
What'd you do?

150
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
I'm hang up here!
Kill it!

151
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,629
- C'mon, kill it.
- It's not working.

152
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,595
Shit!

153
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,158
It's not working.

154
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,673
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

155
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,398
Use the foot brake!

156
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,396
We need some help over here!

157
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,391
Holy shit!

158
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,995
What happened here?

159
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,468
For chrissake, Tucker!
Call an ambulance!

160
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,238
What the fuck happened here!

161
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,833
I was helping him level the mill.
I thought the safety was on...

162
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,670
You thought?

163
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,069
Somebody kill
that fucking machine!

164
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,598
Jesus christ.

165
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,039
Shit.

166
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,998
Hello, Mrs. Shrike.
I've come with the rent.

167
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,548
And so early!
Oh, Mr. Re<nik,

168
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,439
I wish all of my tenants
were as considerate as you.

169
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,114
I'll give you a receipt
in the morning.

170
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,032
Goodnight, Mr. Reznik.

171
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,316
Mrs. Shrike...
Forgive me, but,

172
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,837
have you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

173
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,953
- Has there been a burglary?
- No! No, nothing like that.

174
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,030
I was just wondering
if you've...

175
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,913
you know...

176
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,470
noticed anything
unusual lately?

177
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,437
Unusual?

178
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,351
Never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

179
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,712
Sorry to disturb you so late.

180
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,394
Good night.

181
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:51,756
What we know is this.

182
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,755
One.

183
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,949
Miller was operating the mill
in long sleeves.

184
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:02,267
Two. Miller's arm was
in the cutting zone of the mill

185
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,668
while it was off.

186
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,638
Three. The mill
suddenly activates,

187
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,839
catching Miller's sleeve,
resulting in this.

188
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,352
What's the fucking point?

189
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,477
These accidents
are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

190
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,111
It's our job to investigate these
events from every possible angle,

191
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,793
so that we might prevent
their recurrence.

192
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,279
So we'd appreciated it if you
would be a bit more cooperative.

193
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,829
I knocked into the fucking
activator. By mistake.

194
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,116
What caused the mistake,
Mr. Reznik?

195
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:46,199
- I was distracted.
- By what?

196
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,390
What "distracted" you?

197
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,989
It was lvan.
I was watching lvan in the pit.

198
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,229
The whole thing
was my fault. Okay?

199
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,993
Who did you say?

200
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,753
The new arc welder.
I don't know his last name.

201
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,473
What new arc welder?

202
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,118
Lvan. The guy
from the swing-shift.

203
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,191
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
and this guy took his place.

204
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,793
What the fuck
are you talking about, Re<nik?

205
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,471
Reynolds is right over there
in the pit, as usual busting his ass!

206
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,870
There is no "lvan"
at National Machining, Reznik.

207
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,633
What is this?

208
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,715
Mr. Reznik, have you recently
suffered any head injuries?

209
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,750
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

210
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,508
Nope.

211
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,998
- Trevor?
- Yeah?

212
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,594
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

213
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:05,157
Why do you go out of your way
to come here every night?

214
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,072
Is it out of the way?

215
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,351
An airport?
For coffee and pie?

216
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,990
Suppose I went to Denny's.

217
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,552
Suddenly I get an overwhelming
urge to skip town.

218
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,474
Could I do that at just any diner?

219
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,515
Is someone chasing you?

220
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,593
Not yet.

221
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,155
But they will
when they find out who I am.

222
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,197
Oh, really? Who are you?

223
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,318
Can you keep a secret?

224
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,799
To the grave.

225
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,551
I'm Elvis Presley.

226
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,953
I ran away from home to pursue
my blue collar aspirations.

227
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:44,076
I thought you looked familiar...

228
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,150
Got plans for Mother's Day?

229
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,275
I'm taking my little boy
to the amusement park.

230
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,591
It's supposed to be my day,
yet he gets all the fun.

231
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,274
That's okay, when he's older
I'll let him make it up to me.

232
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,758
A little guilt goes a long way.

233
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,353
- How about you?
- Cemetery.

234
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,112
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

235
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,075
I lost mine, too.

236
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,873
Still hurts.

237
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,030
I'm not too good
at losing family.

238
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,158
Who is?

239
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,469
What's weird is it didn't hit me
till I picked out her burial dress.

240
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,110
I pictured her buying it...

241
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,670
not knowing it would.

242
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,314
You know, be the one...

243
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,636
seems unfair, doesn't it?

244
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,955
Not knowing things like that?

245
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,828
How about spending the day with me
and Nicholas after the cemetery?

246
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,197
Sounds dreamy.

247
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,834
Hey, Reynolds?
What'd the Feds want you for?

248
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,834
Armed robbery.

249
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:43,958
Yeah? Me and Jackson had you pegged
as a pedophile. Right, Jackson?

250
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,347
Probably guilty of that too.

251
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,353
Hey, I don't see
what's so fucking funny.

252
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,149
Y'all clownin' the motherfucker
like it's some big joke.

253
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,753
Well it ain't!

254
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:58,631
Personally, I don't feel
too comfortable workin' with you.

255
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,751
You make me nervous.

256
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,119
You look like shit.
Actin' all crazy.

257
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,031
What's up with you?

258
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,555
Nothing's up with me.
It was an accident.

259
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,836
And I'm the one who's gotta
live with it. Not you.

260
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,437
You ain't hearin' me, man.

261
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,074
Nobody wants you here.

262
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,232
Nobody.

263
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,713
See you tomorrow.

264
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,394
Howdy, partner!

265
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,471
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

266
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,833
What about?

267
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,671
I don't know.
But it seemed important.

268
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,549
Well, it'll have to wait.
It's Miller time!

269
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,913
We need to talk.

270
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:51,798
Follow me.

271
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,748
C'mon.

272
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,033
Another bourbon.

273
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,432
Make it a double.

274
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,111
You shooting coke or something?

275
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,149
You look like a dope fiend
to me. No offense.

276
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,868
I don't use drugs.
Normally I don't even drink.

277
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,711
How about abnormally?

278
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,590
I see Reynolds is back to work.

279
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,431
Yeah. Guess he made bail.

280
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,273
Tell you one thing.
Whatever he did,

281
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,238
- he sure ain't coppin' to it.
- Would you?

282
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,716
Never trust a con, cowboy.

283
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,234
They don't get through
life being honest.

284
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,790
Where they hiding you these days?

285
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,077
Around.

286
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,437
Wanna see something?

287
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,598
Look at that.

288
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,592
Lost 'em on the lathe.

289
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,239
Took the big toe from my left foot
and the pinkie from my right.

290
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,310
That's why I walk with a gimp.

291
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,187
Can't shuffle cards like
I used to but...

292
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,636
the ladies sure like it.

293
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,037
You look like
you've seen a ghost!

294
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,317
Funny you should say that.

295
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,548
The guys at work
don't think you exist.

296
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,431
That's why I can't get a raise!

297
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,830
According to Tucker,
you aren't even on the payroll.

298
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,469
You believe that?

299
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,592
Why would they lie?

300
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,068
They'rejust having
a little fun with ya.

301
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,158
I'm not laughing.

302
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,159
Quit fucking around.
A man lost his arm. He could've died.

303
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,557
That's not my problem.

304
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,471
You caused the accident,

305
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,039
not me.

306
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,512
Where you going?

307
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,515
To take a leak.

308
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,477
You wanna watch?

309
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,032
I'll be right back.
Don't disappear on me.

310
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,035
Son of a bitch.

311
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,513
<i>Hello.</i>

312
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,716
Reynolds. It's Trevor.

313
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,918
<i>What time is it?</i>

314
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,636
How they biting, Reynolds?

315
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,992
<i>- You're drunk, Reznik.</i>
- The game's over.

316
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,078
I got proof on you

317
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,713
and I'm gonna use it.

318
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,067
<i>You better watch your fucking ass,</i>
<i>buddy, before you lose it.</i>

319
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,714
Trevor.

320
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,831
I need to see you, Stevie.

321
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,470
Well, Jesus. Trevor.
I mean I'm not exactly alone...

322
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,915
Please, Stevie.
I think I'm falling apart.

323
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,718
Why don't you come back
in an hour?

324
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,440
No. I need to see you now.

325
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,951
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

326
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,799
Gimme a minute.

327
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,428
I appreciate you making time for me.
You're the only one I can talk to.

328
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,632
It's my pleasure.

329
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:25,350
Most guys don't come here
for my conversation.

330
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,313
Something's
happening to me, Stevie.

331
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:36,195
Some kind of plot.

332
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,234
There was an accident
at the shop.

333
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,108
A man was nearly killed
thanks to me.

334
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,673
Now the guys at work
are against me.

335
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,353
They want me out.
I can't blame 'em.

336
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,034
It's the way
they're going about it.

337
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,874
Their eyes. Their little games...

338
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,428
What?

339
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,194
E-R.

340
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,317
E-R.

341
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:08,152
T-U-C-K-E-R.

342
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,594
Trevor?

343
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,393
Tucker?

344
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,909
Maybe you're taking
this accident thing a bit too hard.

345
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:18,788
I mean,

346
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,112
if they wanted you out

347
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,718
they'd just fire you.

348
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,150
I'm not worried
about being fired.

349
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,630
Then what are you worried about?

350
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,991
I don't know yet.

351
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:49,715
- There you go. Made to order.
- Thank's.

352
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,790
Surprise!

353
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,989
Gotcha. That one's going
on the frigde.

354
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,912
Here. Let me get one
of you and Nicholas.

355
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,191
By the carousel.

356
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,392
Just a minute.

357
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,791
Okay. Ready.

358
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,867
Smile.

359
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,595
It helps to push the button.

360
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,877
Trevor? What is it?

361
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,438
This place.

362
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,315
- Brings back memories.
<i>- Good memories I hope.

363
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,668
Yeah.

364
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:45,270
I haven't been here
since I was a kid.

365
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,599
My ex.

366
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,353
Probably calling to wish me
a happy Mother's Day.

367
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,753
Could you?

368
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,918
Yeah... No sweat.

369
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,671
I'll take Nicholas for a ride.

370
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,875
Thanks.

371
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,635
Hi!

372
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,070
How long have you known
my mother?

373
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,558
About a year.

374
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,953
How'd you meet her?

375
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,357
Well, we just kind of met...

376
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,115
- Are you gonna see her again?
- I hope so.

377
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,912
- Would you like that?
- I guess so.

378
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,238
Wanna know a secret?

379
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,148
What?

380
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,669
My father left us
when I was your age.

381
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,637
Wanna know something else?

382
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:39,957
It made me reali<e
what a wonderful mother I had.

383
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,955
You'll realize that too someday.

384
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,959
What's that?

385
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,959
It's a ride.

386
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,829
"Route 666."
What's it mean?

387
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,115
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

388
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,199
Can we go on it?

389
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,719
Well, Nicholas, maybe
we should wait for your mother.

390
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,990
Looks like someone
had a bad cracked up.

391
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,717
Filler up cowboy!

392
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,348
Won't be eating there
anytime soon, eh, Nicolas?

393
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,436
Look at that!

394
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,909
You should close
your eyes, Nicolas.

395
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,752
Jesus...

396
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,556
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

397
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,558
Shady Lady.

398
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,551
Oh, my God!

399
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,157
Stop!

400
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,832
A right Nicolas.

401
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:50,553
A right! A right!

402
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,189
Nicholas.

403
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,475
Nicholas!

404
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:23,954
Nicholas!

405
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,477
I need some help here!

406
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,911
Somebody get a doctor!

407
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,750
Hang on, Nicholas.
I'm going for help.

408
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,319
Nicholas!

409
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,750
I swear to god,
I don't know what happened.

410
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,316
He's epileptic.
I should've told you.

411
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,514
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No. It'll pass.

412
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,835
It's okay, baby.

413
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,150
This hasn't happened
for a while.

414
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:22,832
I didn't think to mention it.

415
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,672
I could kill myself
for taking him on that ride.

416
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,273
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

417
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,117
He won't even remember it.

418
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,396
It'll be as
if nothing ever happened.

419
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,594
Wanna come in?

420
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,436
I think you could use a drink.

421
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,070
I hope wine's okay with you.

422
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:34,872
It'll work.

423
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,391
What good is a home
if you can't relax in it!

424
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,358
I'll have to remember that.

425
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,073
Trevor, can I ask you something?

426
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,909
Should my lawyer be present?

427
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,958
Why are you always leaving me
such generous tips?

428
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,594
Do I?

429
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,671
Twenty dollars for coffee and pie?

430
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,751
And entertainment.

431
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,119
Entertainment?

432
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,349
You.

433
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,395
Trevor, you don't have to buy
my companionship.

434
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,315
Sorry.

435
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,793
It wasn't meant that way.

436
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,471
If you really want to spoil me,

437
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,631
take me to the movies sometime.

438
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,633
It's a deal.

439
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,351
My goodness. There must be
a hole in this glass.

440
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:47,874
I'll get it.

441
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,069
- You wait on me enough.
- Thanks.

442
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,037
It's the last door on the left!

443
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,149
Reznik.

444
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:30,918
I want you
on the Swansea Lathe today.

445
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:32,752
Where's Sanche<?

446
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:36,070
That's an irrelevant question,
Reznik. I'm asking you.

447
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,509
Shit!

448
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,034
If there is anything
we can do for you let us know.

449
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,712
Thank you, Mr. Furman.

450
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,428
See him out.

451
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,511
Who it is,
Vampire Miller.

452
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,351
- You're okay?
<i>- Good, good.

453
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,478
- You be easy.
- Yeah, man. Take it easy.

454
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,753
My god, Miller.

455
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,879
Where do I begin?

456
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,314
Don't sweat it, kid.
There's nothing to say.

457
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:34,713
I wish there was someway
to repay you.

458
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:40,069
For a start
give me your left arm.

459
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,229
In fact, that's why
I came by. Right, Tucker?

460
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,469
Fair is fair.

461
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,550
We'rejust ra<<in' you, Reznik.

462
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,193
You can keep your arm.
And I'll keep my settlement.

463
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,749
Hell, most guys would give
an arm and a leg

464
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,638
for a deal like this.
I guess you can call me lucky.

465
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,835
Well,

466
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,554
Miller, if there's
anything I can do...

467
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,794
Forget it.
No hard feelings, huh?

468
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,077
See you around, pal.

469
00:50:58,399 --> 00:50:59,718
Jump the line.

470
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,199
Somebody help me.

471
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,475
Somebody.

472
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,312
Reznik! I gotcha, I gotha!

473
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,310
Be cool... Be cool...

474
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,514
Who did it?

475
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:30,793
One of you threw
the fucking breaker!

476
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,439
Or was it all of you?

477
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,353
- Cool your heels, man.
- Was it you?

478
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,238
Or you? Was it you?

479
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:40,038
Nobody did shit, you asshole!
You're imagining things again!

480
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,078
Yeah? Have you been fishing
with lvan lately, Reynolds?

481
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,752
Let's see you talk
your way out of this one!

482
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,949
Where is it?

483
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,598
What a fuck now, Re<nik?

484
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,958
Get him off me!

485
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,472
You're through, you fuck!

486
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,757
Pack up your shit,
get outta here, you're fired!

487
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,831
Motherfucker's crazy.

488
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,513
You lost it, man.

489
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,952
Damn it, where is it?

490
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,918
Asshole.

491
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,232
What the fuck
did you do with it?

492
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,549
Idiot.

493
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,390
Fuck you! Get out!

494
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,314
Hey.

495
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,395
What...

496
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:00,234
It's an occupational ha<ard.

497
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,071
So, Trevor,

498
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,472
you gonna rescue me
from this miserable life or what?

499
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,628
Y'know,

500
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,673
I could give it up
for the right guy...

501
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,867
Boy did that come out wrong.

502
00:55:42,919 --> 00:55:44,716
What I mean is...

503
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,998
I'd y'know,

504
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,118
stop hooking...

505
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,515
if you wanted me to.

506
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:57,236
I mean there's a lot of lesser
paying gigs out there, right?

507
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,836
I think I would like that.

508
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,712
- Mr. Reznik!
- I'm sorry.

509
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,552
I thought you were
somebody else...

510
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:31,311
You gave me such a scare.

511
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,835
What are you doing
in my apartment?

512
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,594
There's a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

513
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,749
That's impossible.

514
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,558
- I was going to leave a note.
- A note?

515
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,877
- What kind of note?
- About the leak...

516
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:50,355
What's that terrible smell?

517
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,717
There's no leak in this apartment.
Now if you'll excuse me.

518
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,950
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, I'm sure.

519
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:58,474
If you need anything,
please call first.

520
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:58,912
Miller...

521
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:19,788
Miller!

522
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,469
Miller!

523
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,352
Eh, Reznik!

524
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,551
Pleasant surprise.

525
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,917
- We need to talk.
- Take a look at this.

526
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,869
Picked it up at Grossman's.
Top of the line.

527
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,676
That's enough yard work
for one day, dear.

528
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,511
I need to be
doing something.

529
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,238
I can't be watching
soap operas all day.

530
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:41,798
The lawn will be here tomorrow.

531
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:44,268
But you won't if you don't
listen to the doctor.

532
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:46,555
Margie, this is Re<nik.

533
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,438
The man who cost me an arm.

534
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:53,711
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

535
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,876
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

536
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,591
Is there someplace we can talk?

537
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,914
Check it out.

538
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,316
Ain't she a beauty?

539
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,957
8 cylinders.

540
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,830
Magnasteer
Speed-sensitive steering.

541
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:21,469
ABS braking
with road-texture detection.

542
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:24,836
Prevents lock up, helps you maintain
control in an emergency.

543
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,035
'Course she's an automatic.

544
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,315
I really wanted
a manual transmission,

545
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,040
but I figured my shifting
wouldn't be so hot.

546
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:36,834
You know I'm not
at National anymore. Right?

547
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:40,787
Yeah. I heard about that.
Sounds like you nearly lost one, too.

548
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:43,675
Don't you find
that a bit ironic, Miller?

549
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,319
Ironic?

550
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:48,393
Sorry, kid, but I left school
in the 8th grade.

551
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,551
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

552
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,351
Moments after
you left the shop,

553
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,273
someone powered up my machine
with my arm in it.

554
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,195
- I nearly got killed.
- Accidents happen.

555
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,713
It was no accident.

556
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,275
Accidents happen
out of negligence.

557
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,311
This happened out of spite.

558
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:10,551
- That's some vocabulary, kid.
- Spite.

559
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:13,597
Ill-will. Vengeance.
Vengeance means revenge, Miller.

560
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:15,670
I'm sure you know what
"revenge" means, don't you?

561
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,434
I'm on to you, Miller.
Despite your stupid jokes

562
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,318
you secretly blame me
for the accident.

563
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:22,276
New car or not,
you despise me for it.

564
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:23,918
How'd you get into my place?

565
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,593
Duplicate key?
Credit card? What?

566
01:01:25,759 --> 01:01:27,317
Fuck you, Miller!

567
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,913
This shit's gonna stop!

568
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,637
Get off my property, punk.

569
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:02,032
Bastards.

570
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,795
Shit.

571
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,148
C'mon!

572
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,669
C'mon!

573
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,948
C'mon!

574
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,272
7-4-3-

575
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,796
C-R-N. 743cRN.

576
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,516
743cRN.

577
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,679
What?

578
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,711
Shit!

579
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,188
Fuck.

580
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:39,828
Fuck!

581
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,509
<i>I'm sorry, sir,</i>

582
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:46,352
but we don't provide motorist
information to the general public.

583
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:49,750
I'm not a member of the general public.
This guy's a friend of mine.

584
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:52,150
You don't know
your friend's address?

585
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,715
We just met.
I don't know him that well.

586
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,277
Sir, this is the DMV.
Not a dating service.

587
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,431
Look, ljust
want to talk to him.

588
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,558
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't help
you unless a crime has been committed.

589
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:05,471
Has a crime
been committed?

590
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,679
Please. I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremely important.

591
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,877
Sorry, sir.
No crime, no information.

592
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,109
What if I told you
I was hit by this car?

593
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,513
I don't see any bruises.

594
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:26,954
If you did would
you give me an address?

595
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:29,835
No. But the police might.

596
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,874
What is it, sweetie?
Tired?

597
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:34,712
You want to go take a nap?
We're almost home.

598
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,871
I want to report
a hit-and-run.

599
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,632
Bring it back
when you're finished.

600
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,794
- Fill it out over there.
- Thanks.

601
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:04,314
Mr. Reznik?

602
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,431
Are you sure
about these plate numbers?

603
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:12,469
743 cRN. That's the one.

604
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,348
- Have you ever had a car stolen?
- No. Why?

605
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:19,828
Because the car that allegedly
hit you was your own.

606
01:07:20,759 --> 01:07:23,876
1965 Red Pontiac Firebird.

607
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,598
Registered in your name.

608
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:29,236
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totaled in a wreck.

609
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:41,792
Do you reali<e it's a felony
to file a bogus police report?

610
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:46,438
Wait a minute. I think you have
some explaining to do.

611
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,109
Jesus, Reznik!

612
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,599
We just want to talk to you!

613
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:19,673
Re<nik! Re<nik!

614
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:21,393
Reznik!

615
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,238
Trevor?

616
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,559
Oh, my god.

617
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,353
Trevor.
What happened?

618
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,674
Trevor. Tell me.

619
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,112
How the hell did it happen?

620
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,910
I was crossing the street.

621
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,391
The light changed on me.

622
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,319
Did he stop?

623
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,230
No, he just keep going.

624
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,389
Fucking hit-and-run drivers.

625
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:28,550
They ought to be hanged.

626
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:32,915
It was my fault.
I wasn't paying attention.

627
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,838
Trevor, I got to get you
to a hospital.

628
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,675
You may have
some internal injuries.

629
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,434
- They're just bruises.
- You see this?

630
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,432
This is a bruise.

631
01:11:44,599 --> 01:11:47,033
That is a train wreck.
All right?

632
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:50,869
What is it with you and doctors
anyway? Don't you trust anyone?

633
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,273
I trust you.

634
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,550
Now I know you're crazy.

635
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:00,950
Can I stay here tonight?

636
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,039
Baby, you can stay here
every night.

637
01:12:04,999 --> 01:12:06,432
You know that.

638
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:09,473
What?

639
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,196
What's going on in
that cra<y head of yours?

640
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,114
I really want this
to work, Stevie.

641
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:21,268
But?

642
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:25,349
You know so little about me.

643
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,149
What if I turn
into a werewolf or something?

644
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,280
I'll buy you a flea collar.

645
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,908
Hello.

646
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,637
- Stevie?
- Yeah?

647
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,799
Thanks.

648
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,034
I set out some clean clothes for you.
You're stuff's not dry yet.

649
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,714
Do you always keep men's clothes
lying around?

650
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:18,992
Some regulars like to keep
a clean change of clothes here.

651
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,073
I'll probably just throw them
out now, right?

652
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,708
A perfect fit.

653
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:30,550
Yeah! Trevor, I don't have
a si<e 26 waist here.

654
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,711
How about that idea?

655
01:13:32,879 --> 01:13:35,518
I could get a job
selling menswear.

656
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:38,833
Those tricks
get paid vacations, too.

657
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:41,149
I could settle for that.

658
01:13:41,999 --> 01:13:43,432
It's not a bad life.

659
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,275
It could be worse. You know
what else I want to do?

660
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,031
I want to clean up
this place

661
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:50,235
and get rid of all that
fucking junk.

662
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,998
Probably looks like
I'm a terrible housekeeper,

663
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:57,071
which I sometimes am, but I can
be also very organi<ed.

664
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,117
I'd do more of that.

665
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:02,270
I would love
to paint the place.

666
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,473
Just make it nice,
be organi<ed

667
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,313
and neat and paint it white...

668
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,470
It'd be nice to have a white,
beautiful place

669
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:42,199
and... a decent stove.

670
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:43,872
It's not a lot to ask.

671
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,355
Well, don't look so surprised.

672
01:14:48,519 --> 01:14:50,908
Even a call girl scramble an egg.

673
01:14:53,879 --> 01:14:57,554
It's funny I never did this
for a guy before...

674
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,275
even cook for my husband.

675
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,757
Jesus christ.

676
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:08,671
Where is he?

677
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,274
Who?

678
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:13,077
You know who.

679
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:16,955
- Trevor?
- Don't.

680
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,274
Jesus, Trevor. What's wrong?

681
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,238
This! Lvan!

682
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,677
He's your ex, isn't he?

683
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,592
- What?
- Why's he doing this?

684
01:15:29,999 --> 01:15:32,035
It's because
I'm fucking you, isn't it!

685
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,478
Now it makes sense.
I'm fucking you!

686
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,517
So he's fucking me!
Where is he?

687
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,910
Hiding in the closet?
Beneath the bed?

688
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:42,274
I don't know what
you're talking about, baby...

689
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:44,512
Don't "baby" me!

690
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:46,831
"Yeah, baby!

691
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:49,429
I'll change my whole
fucking life for you!

692
01:15:49,599 --> 01:15:51,715
I'll do anything
you want, baby!"

693
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,951
You know what?
I don't deserve this...

694
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,478
What'd you do?

695
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:00,549
Slip this from my wallet
while proposing to me?

696
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,871
Fuck you! You left that
in my tip jar the other night.

697
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:06,109
- Bullshit!
- I thought you wanted me to have it!

698
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:08,395
Cut the crap, Stevie!

699
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,393
What's the big deal
about a goddamn picture?

700
01:16:11,559 --> 01:16:14,756
They say the guy in this photo
doesn't exist. This says he does.

701
01:16:14,919 --> 01:16:18,116
I don't understand what
the fuck are you talking about.

702
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,152
I'm talking
about your ex! Lvan!

703
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,309
Who?

704
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:25,868
This guy standing next to you
with the fish?

705
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,632
I am not in that photo.

706
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,910
I'm looking at a picture of you

707
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:35,549
standing next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

708
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,833
It's not me!

709
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,593
Trevor.

710
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,069
It's you. Look.

711
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,550
You lying whore.

712
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,914
Get the fuck out,
you fucking freak!

713
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:12,035
You bet a fucking will,

714
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,988
- you fucking whore!
- You fucking freak!

715
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,715
Now I know why
you're so afraid of doctors!

716
01:17:18,879 --> 01:17:20,392
'Cuz you're a fucking psycho!

717
01:17:24,519 --> 01:17:27,955
<i>My ex, the fucking psycho...</i>

718
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:29,791
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Baby....</i>

719
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,392
<i>... fucking psycho?</i>

720
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,393
Where is Maria?

721
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,914
- Who?
- You know who.

722
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,637
Maria. My waitress.

723
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,155
My. You're chatty tonight.

724
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:22,953
Darling. I'm your waitress...

725
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,869
What's going on here?
I've never seen you before.

726
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,189
What are you talking about?

727
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,587
You come in here every night...
sitting on that same stool...

728
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,478
staring at your coffee.

729
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:38,869
To be honest, I was starting
to think you were a mute.

730
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:40,597
I want to see Maria.

731
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,670
Mister. There is no Maria
that works here.

732
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:50,836
Is everybody in on it?

733
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,749
Let's have a laugh on Trevor,
is that it?

734
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,355
Whatever lvan's paying you,
he's wasting his money.

735
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:04,077
Go home, mister.

736
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,592
Get some sleep.

737
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:26,228
Don't forget your Post-lts.

738
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,836
Christ, Stevie.

739
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,631
How could you?

740
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:19,238
Nicholas?

741
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:56,637
You ougth to pay
your utility bills, Parthner.

742
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,357
You know how difficult
is shaving in the dark?

743
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:05,030
What have you done with Nicholas?

744
01:22:08,879 --> 01:22:11,268
What have I done with Nicholas?

745
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:17,427
Nicholas?

746
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:20,788
He can't hear you now, pal.

747
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:26,709
Come off it.
You know he's dead.

748
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,556
You ought to see
someone about that...

749
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,469
faulty memory of yours, pal.

750
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,350
Might make your life
a little easier.

751
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,518
By the way,

752
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:47,476
I love the little notes
you leave yourself.

753
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,871
The one on the refrigerator
just kills me...

754
01:22:56,879 --> 01:22:59,234
Where's your hospitality, partner?

755
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,869
God!

756
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:09,749
People might get
the wrong idea.

757
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,078
Who are you?

758
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:23,635
It looks you have some
explaining to do, parthner!

759
01:26:25,599 --> 01:26:27,271
I know who you are!

760
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,477
I know who you are!

761
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,833
I know who you are!

762
01:26:57,039 --> 01:26:59,633
I know who you are!

763
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,754
Going somewhere, Mr. Re<nik?

764
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:39,276
Yes, Mrs. Shrike. I'm moving.

765
01:28:40,039 --> 01:28:41,631
I didn't receive notice.

766
01:28:41,799 --> 01:28:45,109
Your lease requires you to give
30 days notice in writing...

767
01:28:45,519 --> 01:28:48,079
It wasn't planned.
Something came up.

768
01:28:48,599 --> 01:28:51,193
You can keep
my security deposit.

769
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,112
I won't be needing it anyway.

770
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:57,197
Really, Mr. Reznik.

771
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,275
You used to be
such a good tenant.

772
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,516
I just don't understand it...

773
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,514
Isn't that pretty?

774
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,877
Would you care to sell it?

775
01:29:22,759 --> 01:29:23,794
No.

776
01:29:24,799 --> 01:29:26,391
It was my mothers.

777
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,631
I've made arrangements
to donate all my things.

778
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:33,915
A truck will be coming by
this afternoon.

779
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,513
Well, if you're just going
to give it away...

780
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,512
If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

781
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,557
I'd like to report
a hit-and-run.

782
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:57,113
We're still gonna need
to get your statement.

783
01:30:57,399 --> 01:30:58,627
Later.

784
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,750
I just want to sleep.

785
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:13,075
I just want to sleep.
