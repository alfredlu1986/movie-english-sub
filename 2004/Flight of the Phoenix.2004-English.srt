2
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,580
Hey, guys. What do y'all think
the deal is with those clowns?

3
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,657
I don't know, but we're not
expecting supplies.

4
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,556
Hey, Rod.
Where you goin', man?

5
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,925
To pack. We're done here.

6
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,687
This is bullshit.
You knew about this.

7
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,680
Kelly. What can I do for you?

8
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,222
You're closing me down.

9
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:50,023
I am not closing you down.
Atlanta is closing you down.

10
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,063
You said you'd back me all the way.

11
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,633
And you said you'd find oil here.

12
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,224
Frank Towns, right?

13
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,297
Hi. I'm Kelly Johnson.

14
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,866
- Hi, Kelly.
- It's my rig.

15
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,527
- Oh.
- So, how long we got?

16
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,606
Just as long as it takes to cap that well
and get your crew on the plane.

17
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,571
This is bullshit!

18
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,342
You can't just show up
and shut us down.

19
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,646
Yeah? Well, just watch me.

20
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:51,052
Yeah, yeah. I've heard your reputation.
"Shut It Down" Towns.

21
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,057
I thought it was inflated.

22
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,754
You know, you screw up...

23
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,024
you pay the price.

24
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,326
Nobody here screwed up.

25
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,631
Really? Well, somebody somewhere
thinks that you did.

26
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,433
You owe me 10 bucks. She's a redhead.

27
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,410
You really enjoy your job,
don't you, Towns?

28
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,987
Kelly, right?

29
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,057
Kelly, there are few things
I do enjoy...

30
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:28,524
but getting my balls broken while I'm
trying to do my job isn't one of them.

31
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,462
Now, get your shit packed, get your crew
together and load this airplane.

32
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,864
And by the way, when we reach Beijing,
you're off the clock.

33
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,902
Have a nice day.

34
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,336
- Thanks very much.
- A.J.

35
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,033
- Yeah.
- Let's get this garbage out of here.

36
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,614
- Nice.
- Good job. Nice one.

37
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,850
These oil rigs...

38
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,359
they attract the sorriest
bunch of zeroes ever.

39
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,294
- Who tied that up?
- Need a little help, man?

40
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,299
- Yeah, right.
- We're gonna be fine. Thanks.

41
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,505
Come on.
Let's clear this shit up, man.

42
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:17,201
- Help me out.
- I just finished loading this thing up!

43
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,278
What a team.

44
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,556
- Oh, man!
- Hold up, man.

45
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,523
- Davis, what are you doing?
- You know I do this when I get on a plane.

46
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,753
- It's good luck, all right? I ain't crashed yet.
- Come on. Move it.

47
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,022
You keep talking like that,
you're gonna jinx us.

48
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,860
- I ain't jinxin' us. This is for good luck.
- Settle down.

49
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,958
Hey!

50
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,506
- You ladies calm down.
- You want to try pushing me into my seat?

51
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,235
- You must be Rodney.
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,472
I knew this guy that worked
with you out in Kuwait.

53
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,072
Didn't that rig get shut down too?

54
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,085
What's your problem?
We're the ones losing our jobs.

55
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,590
We're the ones who had to fly to this
shit hole and pick up all the garbage.

56
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,353
Okay, guys. Knock it off.

57
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,453
You ladies have a safe flight.

58
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,798
Lucky he walked away.

59
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,475
Yes, I... I think you may find it
more comfortable back there...

60
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,476
with the rest of them.

61
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,547
Sure.

62
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,985
Ticktock, Liddle.

63
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,920
Yeah. Don't get too attached to it.
I'm gonna want it back.

64
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,084
- We're all set?
- Looks like we got one more.

65
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:44,492
That can't be. Everybody's here.

66
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,327
I'll let him know he's walkin'.

67
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,526
I guess I need a ride to Beijing.

68
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,104
Not on this flight, Goober.

69
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,902
Anybody know who this guy is?

70
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,536
It's a long story.

71
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,187
Get on board. A.J., start us up.

72
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,349
You're the boss, Frank.

73
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,064
Okay. All set, Mr. President.

74
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:31,336
I think it's about that time that
we do the checklist as the two Bills.

75
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,344
What do you say, buddy?

76
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,244
Well, why change
a good thing? Go ahead, good buddy.

77
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:39,909
Allow me to grab my bulletin.
Seat belts.

78
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,216
I always like to have a little something
strapped to my lap.

79
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,189
Check.

80
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,260
Windows, doors and hatches.

81
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,727
Closed and secured
so no one can disturb us.

82
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,270
Water injection.

83
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,537
That's what she said.

84
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,545
Check.

85
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,547
Gyros.

86
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,880
Set and uncaged,
just like yours truly.

87
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,546
And last, but not least, cow flaps.

88
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,783
Till the cows come home.

89
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,360
I think we're ready to go.
You gonna kiss your lucky man?

90
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,656
- I'll make it happen right now.
- Clear left.

91
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,461
- Clear right.
- All right. Here we go.

92
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,070
My wife was pregnant
with this little guy when I left.

93
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,145
I haven't even met him yet.

94
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,806
That's nice. You must really be
looking forward to getting home.

95
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,884
You have no idea.

96
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,714
- You wanna see my family, bro?
- Yeah.

97
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,848
Check her out, man.
She's my whole life.

98
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,527
When I get back home,
I'm gonna open up a restaurant.

99
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,724
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sammi and Sandra's Sweet Salsa Shop.

100
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,356
That's tight, right? You like that?

101
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,661
How do I know her though?
She look familiar.

102
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,666
What you talking 'bout, man?
You don't know her.

103
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,367
Yeah, yeah, I do.

104
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:44,337
Oh, now I recognize her.

105
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,220
That's a big one, Frank.

106
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,231
What do you want to do?

107
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,200
- Try kissing that lucky man again.
- Frank.

108
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,930
If we go back,
we'd have to get refueled.

109
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,199
God knows how long that'd take.

110
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,071
Let's go up to 14. I've never seen one
go that high before.

111
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,510
Give me full power. Watch the climb.
About 700 feet a minute.

112
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,741
You're the boss, Frank.

113
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,291
Jesus.

114
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,461
What the hell was that?

115
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,165
- That was the aerial, Frank.
- Oh, great.

116
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,402
- I'll go in the back and calm them down.
- Got it.

117
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,539
Hello again, ladies.

118
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,585
As the frequent fliers
amongst you can probably tell...

119
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,246
we're experiencing
some turbulence this morning...

120
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,188
so I kindly ask you to remain seated...

121
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,784
and try not to shit yourselves
all over my airplane.

122
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,797
- What was that noise just now?
- Everything's fine.

123
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,629
A wind gust just tore off the aerial,
but we're gonna keep going.

124
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,865
- The aerial for the radio?
- No, the one for the satellite TV.

125
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,803
- Genius.
- Christ, just turn around.

126
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,705
Thank you so much.

127
00:12:55,407 --> 00:13:00,572
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You planning on flying over the storm?

128
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,045
Wanna close that door
and get the hell back to your seat?

129
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,844
- I believe you're too heavy.
- Will you deal with this?

130
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:12,821
- Look like it's goin' higher.
- We'll go around it.

131
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,257
Set a course 1-8-0 due south.

132
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,522
About 200 miles oughta do it.

133
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,529
Copy. 1-8-0.

134
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:27,371
We won't make it.
The plane is overweight.

135
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,204
Never as bad as this.

136
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,719
All right.
We're comin' around it. Okay.

137
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,620
Okay.

138
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,457
Oh, God.

139
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,258
Come on!

140
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,269
We're in trouble here, A.J.

141
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,308
Check the map.
Find the nearest place we can set it down.

142
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,971
Lhugar's our best shot,
but it's 300 miles south of the basin.

143
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,809
Maybe we can outrun it.

144
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:21,715
Lhugar radio, this is Amacore Transport,
8-7-3-Bravo. Over.

145
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,630
Our location is approximately 40 degrees,
nine minutes north latitude...

146
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,636
84 degrees, 42 minutes east longitude.

147
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,367
- Here we go.
- You puttin' the gear down?

148
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,911
Never get it back up again if we don't.

149
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,946
Mayday, mayday!
Repeat. Mayday, mayday!

150
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,346
Any stations copy?

151
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,316
A.J., ready the passengers.

152
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,955
- Listen up. We got a major problem.
- Oh, God.

153
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,462
Looks like we have to make
an emergency landing.

154
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,500
- Oh, shit.
- Make sure you're strapped in.

155
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:06,263
And if you believe in God,
it's time you call in a favor.

156
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,444
Oh, God!

157
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,849
A.J!

158
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,720
Come on, baby. Come on.

159
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,199
Oh, crap!

160
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,919
No! Oh! Aah! Help!

161
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,533
Oh, God!

162
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,455
Everybody okay?

163
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,421
Everybody okay?

164
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,498
A.J.?

165
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,203
A.J!

166
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,707
- I'm okay.
- You all right?

167
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,505
Are you hurt?

168
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,512
Dr. Gerber's on board.

169
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,447
Where is he?

170
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,849
He's right here.

171
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,423
Jesus! Fire!

172
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,797
Hey! Hey, where do you
think you're going?

173
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,993
- I can't stay in here man. I can't breathe!
- Hey!

174
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,128
That storm is blowin'
a hundred miles an hour out there!

175
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,106
It'll take your skin off before you get
five feet. Now sit down! Sit down!

176
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:34,144
Everybody sit down!

177
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,380
Were you able to send a mayday
before we came down?

178
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,248
We got no response.
The radio's down.

179
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,884
Someone's coming for us
though, right? Right?

180
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,088
Just as soon as the storm is over.

181
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,824
They know where to look for us?

182
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,265
We don't have the same kind
of radar tracking we have in the States.

183
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,963
- Oh, fantastic.
- And it's a big desert, isn't it?

184
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:08,372
We were, uh, due to refuel
in Langhu right about...

185
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,711
right about now, so it'll take 'em
a couple of hours to miss us.

186
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,719
So for right now,
everybody just sit tight.

187
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,812
Conserve your oxygen.

188
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:24,690
Hey, Captain? Don't think
we don't know what you did.

189
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,158
Not many pilots, you know,
could've done that...

190
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,826
so... thank you.

191
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,606
Yes. Thank you, Captain.

192
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,818
Yeah!

193
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,656
It's like being in an hourglass.

194
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,164
I'm just a chef, but even I know ain't no
way a cell phone's gonna work out here.

195
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,035
Well, there's no harm in trying, is there?

196
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,202
You never know.
You never know.

197
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:17,372
I think the company man's losing it.

198
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,178
What the hell are you laughing at?
This is your fault!

199
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,482
- Why is it his fault?
- All that stuff about jinxes.

200
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:26,887
You can't talk like that sitting
in a plane on the bloody tarmac!

201
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,825
- You're the one who put the jinx on us.
- Oh, shut up.

202
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,364
What'd I tell you?

203
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,625
Bunch of zeroes.

204
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,930
Shouldn't somebody say somethin'?

205
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,575
Captain?

206
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,415
I don't think I'm the right person.

207
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,367
What the hell
do they expect me to say?

208
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,447
I don't even know those guys.

209
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,016
Maybe to say you're sorry.

210
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,128
You're looking to join those two?
Keep it up.

211
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,955
So what's his story?

212
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,034
- Who, him?
- Yeah.

213
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,137
He just blew in one day.

214
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,368
Blew in in the middle
of the Mongolian desert?

215
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,672
Said he was taking a year off work,
hitching around the world.

216
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:37,305
He was supposed to fly out a few weeks ago.
His ride never came.

217
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,350
He's been stuck with us ever since.

218
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,197
Not bad.

219
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,369
- That's the last one.
- All right.

220
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,701
Well, we got a decent amount of water.

221
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,274
We each drink a pint a day...

222
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,107
that gives us enough for about 30 days,
if we don't exert ourselves.

223
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,307
Which I'm guessin' wasn't a concern
with the rest of this crew.

224
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,385
I don't see you breaking a sweat, stud.

225
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,581
- Hey, chef!
- Yo.

226
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,056
Chef, how are we doin' on food?

227
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,959
Well, the good news is that
besides the powdered eggs...

228
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,191
all the food's been canned
in water or juice.

229
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,702
The bad news is, it's all peaches
and hearts of palm.

230
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,508
Well, that buys us
a couple extra days.

231
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,634
Ain't that just great news.

232
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,825
So how screwed are we?

233
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,892
Pretty screwed.

234
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,022
Where are we?

235
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:05,091
Somewhere around here, in the middle of
the Yol Valley, 200 miles west of our course.

236
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,567
- We're still in Mongolia?
- Nah.

237
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,608
I think we're in China.

238
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,042
Just over the border.

239
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:18,138
Wouldn't suppose there'd be
a Four Seasons Hotel out here, would there?

240
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,085
Langhu, a few hundred miles
just due south of here.

241
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,624
Well out of walking range.

242
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:34,330
I could make it.
I could walk to Langhu.

243
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,923
I'm in good shape.
I ran three marathons.

244
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,536
In a row, I hope.

245
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,372
Have you walked in the desert before?

246
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,806
I hiked in the Mojave with my girlfriend.

247
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:49,436
This isn't the Mojave.

248
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:54,382
This is the Gobi. And let me warn you,
July is the hottest month in the Gobi.

249
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,616
You will be taking a pint of water,
and you'll sweat 10.

250
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,785
I'll just go by night.

251
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,332
You'd have to.
But how would you keep your course?

252
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,264
A compass.

253
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:15,338
Beyond these dunes,
we are surrounded by Altai Mountains.

254
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,670
And they are mostly magnetic rock.

255
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,044
Have you ever seen a compass dance?

256
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,518
What about this map?
I'll just take this map.

257
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,055
How old is that map, Captain?

258
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,456
Too old, the way the sand shifts
around here all the time.

259
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,519
And Captain Towns's calculations
could be off by 20 percent.

260
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,397
- No offense. I'm not saying that they are.
- None taken.

261
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,504
But even if the captain
is one percent in error...

262
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,198
and you march 300 miles by the stars...

263
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,935
you'd miss Langhu, and you wouldn't
even know it was there to miss.

264
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,944
You'd be walking in a circle.

265
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,105
- You're right-handed?
- Right.

266
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:01,515
That means your right leg's more developed
than your left. You take a longer step with it.

267
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,985
You'd be walking
in a left-handed circle.

268
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,648
You know what?
Forget it, all right? Y'all win, okay?

269
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,488
This isn't about winning or losing.

270
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,062
This is about staying alive.

271
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,179
Hey, Rod?

272
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,044
Hmm?

273
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:36,683
You don't...

274
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,416
You don't think the suit was right...

275
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,719
do you?

276
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,919
That I jinxed us or...

277
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,698
Don't worry about it, John.

278
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,492
Just try and get some sleep.

279
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,248
Maybe I should save this.

280
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,464
God!

281
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,869
Oh, man.

282
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,774
Hello?

283
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,180
Help me!

284
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,118
Kelly. You seen Davis this morning?

285
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:54,157
Knowing him, he's still sleeping.

286
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:56,317
- Go wake his ass up.
- Davis!

287
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,895
Get up, you big baby!

288
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,260
Davis!

289
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,029
- Wake your ass up, man.
- Davis?

290
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,369
Well?

291
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,275
His stuffs all here.

292
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,780
Any of you lads seen Davis this morning?

293
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,645
He's not there.

294
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,887
Davis!

295
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,287
- This was you...
- Davis?

296
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,860
- Telling him he jinxed us.
- Davis!

297
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,259
- Oh, come on. I didn't mean that.
- Quit screwing around!

298
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,331
- Davis!
- He couldn't have gone far.

299
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,424
- Could he? Could he?
- Yo, Davis!

300
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:41,631
- How the hell could we lose someone? Davis!
- John!

301
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,503
We should have paired up.
Someone should have been watching him.

302
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,577
Hey! Not another word from you.
You hear me?

303
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,306
- This ain't funny no more!
- John!

304
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,077
- Davis!
- Davis!

305
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,312
- John!
- Davis!

306
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,686
- Davis!
- It's coming.

307
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,526
Davis!

308
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,625
He's got to be out here somewhere.
I've got to go find him!

309
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,134
Too late, Rodney!

310
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,238
Hey! Get back here!

311
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:17,671
Right. I'm not losing another friend
out here. I have to go and find him!

312
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,107
No! No one else dies, understand?

313
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,179
He's only a kid, for Christ's sake!

314
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,874
- Alex! Alex!
- God! Jesus! John!

315
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:28,440
Alex! Towns is right! He's right!

316
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,851
- You can't help him!
- John!

317
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,947
- You can't.
- John!

318
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:16,463
What kind of odds do you give us
a search party's gonna find us?

319
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,661
About five percent.

320
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,772
Right. Five percent.

321
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,171
So, based on a five-percent chance...

322
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,574
you're gonna choose
to sit on your ass and do nothing?

323
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,047
As opposed to what?

324
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,016
Trying to figure a way out of here.

325
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,884
- Look, we are in the middle of a desert...
- Yes. I know.

326
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,753
With no radio, very little water,
even less food.

327
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,850
If we try to walk out of here,
we're gonna last about two days.

328
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:47,226
The odds of crashing an airplane
are certainly less than five percent...

329
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:49,458
so I would consider myself
an optimist.

330
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,899
Or maybe just an asshole.

331
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,913
All right.

332
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:09,282
Listen, since Davis just disappeared,
they're pretty freaked out.

333
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,015
- They should be.
- They're looking to you.

334
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,250
Lady, this is not the Girl Scouts.

335
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:18,192
I am not everybody's den mother.
They are grown men. They can deal with it.

336
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,730
Thanks a lot.

337
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,901
You're welcome.

338
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,981
Kelly, please, come sit with me.

339
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,585
I'm just curious.

340
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,144
The pipe jacket in the back...
what's it all worth?

341
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,589
Not much.
It's worn or used up. Nothing.

342
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,820
It's the same with the tools.

343
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,623
Why?

344
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,034
Hang on a minute.

345
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:59,625
You don't think anybody's coming.

346
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,728
Do you?

347
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:05,899
- Well, do you?
- I don't know, Alex.

348
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,843
Don't be pathetic.

349
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,973
I'm telling you, they're coming.

350
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,143
I know they are.

351
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,484
- For who, you?
- Yes, for me.

352
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,489
And for you.

353
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,219
They have a corporate responsibility
for all of us.

354
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,263
They're out there right now, searching.
It's just a matter of time.

355
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,825
Ian, you did a cost-benefit analysis before
recommending our site be closed down, right?

356
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,496
Yes, I did.

357
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,133
Don't you think they'd do the same thing
before mounting a search for us?

358
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,177
Add it up.

359
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,009
Don't kid yourself, Ian.

360
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,018
We hitched a ride with the trash...

361
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,554
not the other way around.

362
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,362
Screw this. I'm outta here.

363
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,472
Yeah, I'm coming with you,
and I'm taking some water.

364
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:10,699
No one touches the water!

365
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:14,538
Hey. Whoa. What's going on here?

366
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,579
- What does it look like?
- Hey!

367
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,649
- Get back here!
- Hey!

368
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,548
Hey, knock it off!

369
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,054
- Go back!
- Let go!

370
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,155
It's gone, you fools!

371
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:39,836
I have an idea.

372
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,870
I have an idea.

373
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,940
I can get us out of here.

374
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,441
I can get us out of here.

375
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,711
I've been examining the plane.

376
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,649
You see, the... the C-119...

377
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,778
is a twin-boom design...

378
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:01,221
and the starboard boom here
isn't damaged...

379
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,556
which is great because if-if
the starboard engine stays where it is...

380
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,460
at the forward end
of the starboard boom...

381
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,126
this boom then becomes the fuselage...

382
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,236
becomes the plane.

383
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,396
Do you see what I'm saying?

384
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,806
And-And while the port area
of the tail unit is intact...

385
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:24,608
we will still have to redesign
the tail section.

386
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,876
What the hell is he talking about?

387
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,475
He's talking about
building a new airplane.

388
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,148
- Out of the old one.
- Yes, Captain.

389
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,817
And flying ourselves out of here.

390
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:38,918
Yeah, why didn't I think of that?

391
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:41,930
Why don't we build a swimming pool,
while we're at it?

392
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:44,159
Oh, that's funny.

393
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,201
Yeah.

394
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,269
Well, you know,
there are no component problems...

395
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,842
and we have all the parts and tools
we need on board.

396
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:56,379
- I assure you, we can do it.
- It's impossible.

397
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,608
At first glance, it seems impossible
that a bee should fly...

398
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,548
but it does.

399
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,485
I think a bee stung you
on your big dumb-ass head.

400
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,981
What do you know about airplanes?

401
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,561
I design them, Mr. Towns.

402
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,130
That's what I know about airplanes.

403
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:21,333
You might have mentioned that little piece
of information a bit earlier on, Elliott.

404
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,676
Who do you work for?
What company?

405
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,839
Sizemore and Pratt.
They're in Long Beach.

406
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,042
They do mostly experimental aircraft.

407
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:39,111
Mm-hmm. And you understand that
engine's got a 2,000-pound thrust?

408
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:40,212
Yes. So?

409
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:43,557
When it gets started,
it's gonna tear your bee apart.

410
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,097
Well, you'll just have to
be careful this time.

411
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:51,726
The design is perfect. The only flaw
is that we have to rely on you to fly it.

412
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,441
I say we build the damn plane.
Why the hell not?

413
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,512
- Get us out of here.
- Let's build it, man.

414
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,104
It's better than doin' nothin',
fightin' over water.

415
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:09,152
- It's worth a try.
- Oh, yeah. It's worth a try!

416
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:13,622
If we had a few months and an unlimited
supply of water, which we don't.

417
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,625
And if you do try, you won't live
long enough to finish it.

418
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,355
None of you will.

419
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,365
- We could work.
- So what do you think we should do?

420
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,736
- Nothing.
- What?

421
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:31,274
The longer we wait, the better chance
we have of somebody spotting us.

422
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,922
Where's Liddle?

423
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,197
Oh, shit.

424
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,699
Has anybody seen Liddle?

425
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,235
He's definitely not in here.

426
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,839
Oh, God. We lost another one.

427
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,173
He'll never make it.

428
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,249
Shit.

429
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,514
Maybe he doesn't give your sit-on-your-ass-
and-do-nothing plan much hope.

430
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,751
Hey, you're not going after him.

431
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,124
No one else dies, remember?

432
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,637
I'll go.

433
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,673
I'll bring him back.

434
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,072
- A.J.?
- Yeah?

435
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,373
Throw me that canteen.

436
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,479
Good luck.

437
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,586
- Yeah.
- Captain, Liddle's first name is James.

438
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,895
Jimbo.

439
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,208
Liddle!

440
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,763
Liddle!

441
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,006
No.

442
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,839
Someone's already been here.

443
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:30,880
The dead guy's Kyle.

444
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,108
He had a really nice Seiko.

445
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,449
I know, 'cause he won it from me
in a poker game back at the patch.

446
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,686
Someone came along and took it.

447
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,694
Nomads.

448
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:50,426
Smugglers, probably.
That's the last thing we need.

449
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,069
You okay?

450
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,907
I'm not going back.

451
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,809
I'm just resting.

452
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,847
You look like you could use some water.

453
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,328
So, just between the two of us...

454
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,197
no bullshit, Captain Towns...

455
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:29,533
do you think they're ever gonna find us?

456
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,534
It's a long shot.

457
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,941
So why not try and build the plane?

458
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,779
Why give people false hope?

459
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,853
Come on, man.

460
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,952
Most people spend
their whole lives hanging on...

461
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:51,960
to hopes and dreams that are never gonna
come true, but they hold on to 'em.

462
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,554
Why are you gonna give up on 'em now
when you need 'em most?

463
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:00,535
You're assuming I'm one of those people
who has hopes and dreams.

464
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,967
I find it hard to believe that a man
who learns to fly never had a dream.

465
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,539
Look, how could I let those people
build that plane...

466
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,050
when I don't believe it'll work?

467
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:20,613
And every day they waste trying to build it
brings 'em one day closer to dying.

468
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,957
I think a man only needs
one thing in life.

469
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,058
He just needs someone to love.

470
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,401
If you can't give him that,
then give him something to hope for.

471
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:40,738
And if you can't give him that...

472
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,779
just give him something to do.

473
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,954
James, you'll never make it.

474
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,961
Then I'll die trying.

475
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,940
There are people counting on me.

476
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,343
Okay! Okay, okay.

477
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,784
Okay.

478
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,377
We'll build it.

479
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,457
Just come back with me.

480
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:33,094
How do I know you're not full of shit?

481
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,570
Here.

482
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,576
Take it.

483
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:51,671
You can give it back when we get home.

484
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,443
- What?
- Nothing.

485
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,172
- I'm just amazed.
- By what?

486
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,248
That during these dire times...

487
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,250
you take the time
to thank God for anything.

488
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,879
Well, we're still alive, aren't we?

489
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,688
Let me tell you a story.

490
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,728
A rabbi and a priest
attend a boxing match.

491
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,095
They watch as the boxers
come into the ring.

492
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,432
The rabbi sees one of the boxers
cross himself.

493
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,802
So the rabbi turns to the priest
and asks...

494
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:53,705
"What does that mean?"

495
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,770
The priest says, "Not a damn thing
if the man can't fight. "

496
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,482
Holy shit. Liddle!

497
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,823
Holy shit! They made it!

498
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:14,192
They're back! They're back!

499
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,245
- There you go.
- Yeah.

500
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,219
Liddle and I had a talk.

501
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,953
I think we should build the plane.

502
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,889
Wha...

503
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,154
Elliott...

504
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:48,288
can you really design this thing
the way you said you could?

505
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,561
- No bullshit?
- Yes, I can.

506
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,499
Well, we're either all in this together
or no one at all.

507
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,609
No compromises.

508
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,280
I'm in.

509
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,077
Yeah.

510
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,318
Yeah, me too.

511
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,786
Shit. Me three.

512
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,481
Okay.

513
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,294
Get some rest.

514
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,989
We start tonight.

515
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,726
Let's take them inside. It's cooler.

516
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,496
- Hold on.
- Let me take this.

517
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:35,401
If we do this,
we'll be cutting our lives in half.

518
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,980
We'll be drinking twice
as much water, Frank.

519
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,606
We don't have any other choice.

520
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,345
Why?

521
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,115
'Cause it's too early to give up, A.J...

522
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,691
and too late to do anything else.

523
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:52,523
I'm glad that you've finally
seen the light, Mr. Towns.

524
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,426
Hey.

525
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,765
Let's get one thing straight.

526
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,034
I'm not taking orders from you.

527
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,177
Get some rest.

528
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,722
Hey, Towns.

529
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,822
Thanks.

530
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,122
Are you kidding me?

531
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:29,721
I'd do anything to avoid another
hopes-and-dreams speech.

532
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:41,310
Okay, gentlemen, our-our
first task is to separate the wing here...

533
00:49:41,444 --> 00:49:45,403
so... so we can join it
with the main fuselage, okay?

534
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,359
Crank it up, man!

535
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,865
I'm gonna need some help.

536
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,658
- Make sure they're good and tight, Ian, eh?
- All right.

537
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,697
There you go.

538
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,666
You still got some of them
old muscles up there, don't you?

539
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:43,034
You guys need to be careful
when you step on the wing, okay?

540
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,609
Man, I thought this would be easy.

541
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,643
Hey, no coffee breaks.

542
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,179
That means you too.

543
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,250
You know, I liked him a lot better
when all he did was hum.

544
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,548
Yeah, you still got it.

545
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,220
Whoa! Aah!

546
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:06,989
- Watch what you're doin', man.
- You got it, Rod?

547
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,997
Hang on.

548
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,531
- On three, yeah?
- Let's do it.

549
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,296
One, two, three!

550
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:18,032
Again! One, two, three!

551
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:21,337
- There you go!
- One more time! One, two, three!

552
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:26,006
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

553
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,516
I'll be damned.

554
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,092
That's a start, Frank.

555
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,563
Oh, geez.
Somebody turn out the lights.

556
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:52,141
- How much water did we drink?
- Too much.

557
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,473
And that's at night.

558
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,489
Two-eighths.

559
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,657
- Frank.
- Hmm?

560
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,097
You okay?

561
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,702
When I was out there,
when I found Liddle...

562
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,399
- Yeah?
- I saw something pretty weird.

563
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,169
What?

564
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,542
You know that poor son of a bitch
that fell out of the airplane?

565
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:35,414
- Yeah?
- I found shell casings all around his body.

566
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:38,316
Looked like someone had been
using him for target practice.

567
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,652
Oh... shit.

568
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,629
Just keep that to yourself, all right?

569
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:50,700
I don't want to give 'em
anything more to worry about.

570
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,791
Here.

571
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,868
- Whoo, that's a fire, boy!
- Oh, yeah.

572
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,447
Hey, Patch.

573
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:10,178
How 'bout a nice ice-cold
double mint Frappuccino?

574
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:12,982
Screw that.
How 'bout a Bacardi and Coke?

575
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,080
Ahh. With a lot of ice.

576
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:18,718
- And one of 'em little umbrella things.
- Yeah!

577
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,661
- How 'bout a hamburger with a lot of cheese?
- Whoa, whoa.

578
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,962
Hamburger, yeah. Cheese, mmm.
I'm tryin' to watch my figure, you know?

579
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,069
Yeah!

580
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,632
- One day.
- Yeah. Someday soon, man.

581
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,628
How's it going?

582
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:07,138
- Is everybody okay?
- Sammi!

583
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,473
Ah, geez.

584
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,776
Oh, my God.

585
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,873
Everybody here?

586
00:54:14,984 --> 00:54:17,680
Oh, Christ.

587
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:21,450
Oh, no.
Tell me that wasn't all the fuel.

588
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:40,705
We're gonna need
the remaining fuel for the plane.

589
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,610
- We're gonna have to work during the day.
- What?

590
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:49,481
And what kind of hole
is that gonna put us in with the H20?

591
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:53,078
We're gonna run out before
we even finish the damn plane.

592
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:59,224
Not necessarily. Day shift output
is always higher than night anyway.

593
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:02,696
If we add in the fact that we're gonna
be able to see what we're doing...

594
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,666
I'd estimate
that our productivity per pint...

595
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,702
would actually increase.

596
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,736
We'd drink more, finish sooner.

597
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,611
"Come to the Gobi," they said.

598
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,347
"Great prospects," they said.

599
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:29,585
"Sun, sand, oil. "

600
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:32,160
Well, two out of three ain't bad.

601
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,138
How's it coming?

602
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,368
- What?
- How's it coming?

603
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,935
- Good.
- Good. Well, don't take all day.

604
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,451
And you two can step it up here as well.

605
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,521
Get a move on.

606
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:18,963
- Okay. Go for it.
- All right. Here goes.

607
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:23,101
Easy, Towns.
For God's sake, this is surgery!

608
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,349
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

609
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,751
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

610
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:36,291
- Whoa! Yeah!
- Yeah!

611
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,292
Yes!

612
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:41,693
- Hey, give me some.
- How's it look, A.J.?

613
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,766
Looks good, man!

614
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,266
So, gentlemen...

615
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,704
and lady...

616
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:53,469
our task today is to mate
the port wing with the starboard.

617
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,476
Okay?

618
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:01,648
For that, Sammi, we need you. Okay?

619
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:09,314
You sure you know what to do?

620
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,655
Yeah, I think so.

621
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,753
Sammi, you have to join the wings.

622
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:18,095
We have only one chance with this.
If it doesn't work, we don't fly.

623
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:21,032
And we all die horribly.

624
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,161
Yeah, no pressure on me, right?

625
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:27,504
Just a little bit.
But you'll be a'right, man.

626
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,578
Make us proud.

627
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,883
Whew.

628
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,419
What am I doing? I'm a chef.

629
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,423
Slowly!

630
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,425
Even. Straight! Take it easy.

631
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:47,496
Jeremy, keep in line with Rodney.

632
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:57,063
- Stayin' straight?
- Yeah.

633
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,233
Jeremy!

634
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,073
Don't let go! Don't let go!

635
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,306
Watch out, Sammi!

636
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,905
- Hold on!
- I got it!

637
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:11,046
- No!
- Get back!

638
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,088
Shit!

639
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,354
Oh, Sammi.

640
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:35,571
See? Piece of cake.

641
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,442
You mad Mexican bastard!

642
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,573
What were you thinking?

643
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,583
Sammi!

644
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,585
Jesus!

645
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,587
Anybody got a change of underwear?

646
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,589
You can always borrow Rady's.

647
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:52,593
- I'm not sure how clean they are though.
- You made us proud, Sammi.

648
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,663
Thought you'd shit yourself.

649
00:58:56,265 --> 00:58:59,065
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about.

650
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,234
No, no. What are you doin'?

651
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,932
- God, please. Turn this shit off.
- What's the problem?

652
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,975
- Listen, man, your deejay rights
have been revoked.

653
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,619
Hey, I was gonna play that next, man.

654
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,339
Hey.

655
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:16,942
Cheers, man.

656
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,545
Them things'll kill ya.

657
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,447
Hey, what are you doing, Ian?

658
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,347
Oh, just sending an e-mail
to an old friend.

659
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,886
What? Really?

660
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,518
You're a funny fucker.

661
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,901
No, no, no, no.

662
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,437
We do not have time
for rods and linkages.

663
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:19,440
As you should know, we have
an extremely large lifting surface.

664
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,442
It's oversized for the weight load.

665
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,445
We won't need more than
10 to 15 degrees of pitch control...

666
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,947
and all of that will need to be
nose-down pitched.

667
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:29,279
That's where we need to apply
better torque flexing.

668
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,785
Are you even listening to me?

669
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,654
Maybe it'll rain.

670
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,341
It is raining.

671
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,284
It's electrical.

672
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,345
- Jesus. We gotta get out of here.
- Why? What does that mean?

673
01:02:07,456 --> 01:02:09,014
- It's electrical!
- What?

674
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,025
The storm... it's electrical.

675
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,027
If lightning hits anything,
it'll be the plane.

676
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:13,728
So what?

677
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:15,961
- The plane's not grounded!
- I don't understand your problem.

678
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,500
You don't understand?
That wing is full of fuel.

679
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:25,372
Oh, my God. It'll explode.

680
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:29,035
Come on! Come on!
We've gotta get clear!

681
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,045
A.J! Get out of there!

682
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,116
- Hurry up!
- Elliott!

683
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:43,154
Come on! Give me some help!

684
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,989
- Jeremy, come on!
- No!

685
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,658
Take the winch out as far as you can!

686
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:11,881
Now bury it and get the hell away!

687
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:20,190
Elliott! Oh, for Christ's sake!

688
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:34,275
Frank!

689
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,614
Thank you.

690
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,096
Frank! Are you okay?

691
01:03:56,198 --> 01:03:58,166
Yeah. Yeah.

692
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:01,432
You'd think someone...

693
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,370
who designs airplanes
for a living would...

694
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,941
know they need to be grounded.

695
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:24,891
Fo... Een... Phoenix.

696
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:27,359
You from Phoenix or somethin'?

697
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,558
No. It's not the city.

698
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,861
The phoenix was a desert bird...

699
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,901
from Egyptian mythology.

700
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:37,494
Consumed itself with fire...

701
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,607
rose renewed from the ashes.

702
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,972
Final answer?

703
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:43,772
Final answer.

704
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:47,406
Very good, Mr. Towns. And Mr. Liddle.

705
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,917
Yeah, you learn a lot of useless bullshit
waiting to take off.

706
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,822
I thought you weren't religious, Rady.

707
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:58,691
Spirituality is not religion.

708
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,659
Religion divides people.

709
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,731
Belief in something unites them.

710
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,335
Is that spelled right?

711
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,338
Hey.

712
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,876
Nah. It is crooked though.

713
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,945
51, 52, 53, 54...

714
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,947
55, 56, 57...

715
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:23,813
58, 59, 60, 61...

716
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:27,286
62, 63, 64.

717
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:45,829
Well, he'll just have to compensate.

718
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:01,714
All right. Could you hand me the...

719
01:06:04,092 --> 01:06:06,060
Thank you.

720
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:20,438
Okay, I need everyone
over here right now. Now!

721
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:25,577
- Whoa. What the...
- A.J.

722
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,410
Someone's stealing water.

723
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:33,019
I've had a suspicion
for the last few days...

724
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,749
so I've been checking the levels.

725
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,954
We don't need a gun.

726
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,724
A.J.

727
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,331
You planning on
shooting someone, A.J.?

728
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,373
While you've all been sleeping...

729
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:55,443
I've been working.

730
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,979
And, therefore,
I require more water.

731
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,313
- Are you kidding me?
- Why didn't you just ask?

732
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:07,354
Because I'm in charge
of building my plane...

733
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,890
and I don't need to
ask anyone anything.

734
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,460
We could all die of thirst!

735
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:16,223
You need me, Towns.

736
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:18,322
Don't forget that.

737
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:20,560
You need me.

738
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,729
Everyone here is dispensable
except me.

739
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,006
They aren't nomads.

740
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,011
How do you know?

741
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:40,081
No women or children.

742
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:50,080
Smugglers or arms dealers.
Either way, it's bad news.

743
01:08:50,225 --> 01:08:52,125
But they could help us.

744
01:08:52,227 --> 01:08:55,628
They could have water.
Maybe we could bargain with them.

745
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,631
What do you think?

746
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:00,463
- Should we go over there and find out?
- Whatever you wanna do, Frank.

747
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:03,697
What are you doing?
You can't go over there.

748
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:06,933
We can't risk losing the pilot.

749
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:09,442
Then I'll go. You cover me.

750
01:09:09,544 --> 01:09:11,944
Did you hear what I just said?

751
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,947
We got this, Elliott.

752
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,950
Ian, don't you think
you should go as well?

753
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:17,951
Why me?

754
01:09:18,052 --> 01:09:19,843
Because you know most
of the local dialects.

755
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,555
- You do?
- Hold on.

756
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:25,991
He's had to. He's worked all over the Gobi
doing negotiations with local crews.

757
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:29,086
It's gon' be cool, man.
I got your back.

758
01:09:29,197 --> 01:09:31,631
And who's gonna look after yours?

759
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,006
All right then.

760
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,843
- Good luck, Frank.
- Good luck.

761
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:40,967
You know, Alex, I...

762
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:43,094
I just want to say that...

763
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:46,106
you know, when I moved you
to the back of the plane...

764
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:49,302
that was stupid and wrong,
and I'm really, really sorry.

765
01:10:51,446 --> 01:10:53,937
Now's not the best time to talk.

766
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:14,993
Ian, now's the time to talk.

767
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,512
Ian.

768
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,849
What the hell?

769
01:11:29,584 --> 01:11:31,484
Screw this.

770
01:11:35,657 --> 01:11:37,557
Um...

771
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:41,387
airplane, uh...

772
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:43,123
Just... Just try "airplane. "

773
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:45,995
Airplane.

774
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,695
Ah.

775
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:03,249
What's he saying to me?

776
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:05,979
I think he's offering to share water.

777
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,305
- What are you saying?
- They want to know where the plane is.

778
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:26,135
Don't tell them anything else.

779
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,868
- It's okay.
- Ian...

780
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,809
Do not tell them
where the goddamn plane is.

781
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,845
- What the hell are you doing?
- What's going on?

782
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:45,717
I'm not sure. Looks okay.

783
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:51,965
- That's my watch!
- Shh.

784
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,729
No!

785
01:13:05,747 --> 01:13:08,215
- No!
- Oh, shit.

786
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,688
Oh, shit!

787
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,531
Alex. Alex?

788
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,033
Look at me. Look at me.

789
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:29,035
Don't die.
Look at me. Look at me.

790
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:31,537
- Alex.
- Come on, Alex.

791
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,608
Come on, man. Stay with me.

792
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,935
Alex.

793
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,045
Alex, I'm here.

794
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:42,776
Frank!

795
01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:45,045
Come on, man.

796
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,557
Stay with me. Alex.

797
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:53,892
Alex, look at me. Alex.

798
01:13:53,995 --> 01:13:55,963
Help!

799
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,293
We're almost there!

800
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:11,269
Set him down over here!

801
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,290
Oh, God!

802
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:27,520
Don't really know what to do here.

803
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,393
Is there nothing you can do?

804
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:33,160
Uh, wh...
We could clean the wound.

805
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,203
- But we'd need water.
- How much water?

806
01:14:36,304 --> 01:14:37,931
As much as he needs!

807
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,352
No. No!

808
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,934
No! He's gonna be okay!

809
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,903
He's gonna be okay!

810
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:19,042
What did he say?

811
01:16:16,037 --> 01:16:19,006
If I hadn't seen the watch, he...

812
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,445
If you hadn't done what you did...

813
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,515
we'd all be dead.

814
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,543
It's okay.

815
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:45,258
- You found any water?
- Yep. Just a little bit.

816
01:16:45,366 --> 01:16:47,561
Oh, good.

817
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:53,166
- Help, you guys!
- Come on!

818
01:16:53,274 --> 01:16:55,242
Give us a hand!

819
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,103
Help him! Come on!

820
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:01,114
Holy shit.

821
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,250
Come on!

822
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:06,513
What the hell is this shit?

823
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:12,558
What is he saying? What is he saying?

824
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,924
Ian, what is he saying?

825
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:18,594
We didn't know what else to do.

826
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,600
We couldn't just let him die.

827
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:23,899
And why not?
These bastards killed Rodney.

828
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,641
There's not enough water for anybody else,
and he's not getting any peaches.

829
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:30,802
Maybe we can give him
some of Rodney's share.

830
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,813
Yeah. Why don't you just offer him
your watch while you at it, asshole?

831
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:37,248
- He's a human being, man!
- We should have just let them go their own way.

832
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,252
They probably wouldn't even
have seen us.

833
01:17:39,387 --> 01:17:42,151
Don't be stupid. They would have
killed us all if they had a chance.

834
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,919
- You don't know that.
- I know they ain't hesitate when they killed Rodney!

835
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,960
What are you people thinkin', man?

836
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:51,691
- He can't stay around here.
- Oh, yeah? Well, where are we gonna take him?

837
01:17:51,799 --> 01:17:54,666
Pick his ass up and drag him back
where you found him at.

838
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:56,896
Shit!

839
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:03,135
Well, that settles that.

840
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:10,683
What the hell is the matter with you?

841
01:18:10,785 --> 01:18:13,720
Oh, shut up.

842
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:18,053
He would have survived only a couple
of days drinking all of our water.

843
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,821
I did us a favor.

844
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:25,224
You murdered him, asshole!

845
01:18:26,634 --> 01:18:29,159
No, no, no, no, no, no.

846
01:18:30,838 --> 01:18:35,207
The great Captain Towns
murdered him.

847
01:18:37,078 --> 01:18:39,205
In his infinite wisdom...

848
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:43,182
he let you go over there,
and I told you not to!

849
01:18:44,385 --> 01:18:47,047
And now we're one man short.

850
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:52,059
That's 12 man-hours lost
every day we work.

851
01:18:52,193 --> 01:18:56,027
Last night alone
cost us 84 man-hours...

852
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,064
because none of you worked at all!

853
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,293
You made the wrong decision!

854
01:19:00,401 --> 01:19:02,869
You could have killed us all again!

855
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:06,338
You knew we were overweight! I told you
that then, and you just didn't listen!

856
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,968
I had to take on another passenger!
You! Remember?

857
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,876
If it weren't for your colossal
arrogance and stupidity...

858
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:15,245
we wouldn't be here at all!

859
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,544
Get up!

860
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,357
Someone's gonna have to
go talk to him.

861
01:19:58,459 --> 01:20:01,428
Give him the hopes-and-dreams speech.

862
01:20:01,562 --> 01:20:03,530
Worked on me.

863
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:10,002
All right.

864
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:12,004
I'll go with you.

865
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:14,233
Man, I'm tired of this guy.

866
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,010
Yeah.

867
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:20,080
But we need him.

868
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:33,527
Elliott?

869
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:43,668
We can still finish the Phoenix.

870
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:50,010
Come on, Elliott. You're the only one
who can get us out of here.

871
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:55,938
To tell you the truth,
I'm no longer interested.

872
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,280
We've wasted too much time already.

873
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,655
If I had the strength of 10 men...

874
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,591
I would have had that thing
built by now.

875
01:21:07,962 --> 01:21:10,522
But all I have is you...

876
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:13,225
and your unreliable people.

877
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:25,444
We're ready to be reliable now.

878
01:21:25,546 --> 01:21:28,572
Oh.

879
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:31,083
You're ready to be reliable now?

880
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:33,779
Mm-hmm.

881
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:37,091
Say "please. "

882
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:41,587
You're kidding.

883
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:44,290
Say "please. "

884
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,664
Please.

885
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,672
What?

886
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,140
Please.

887
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,438
Say it again. Louder.

888
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,513
Please.

889
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:05,285
Jeremy?

890
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:09,422
Please.

891
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,287
"Please" what?

892
01:22:15,396 --> 01:22:18,331
Please, can we finish the plane, sir?

893
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,401
Please?

894
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:22,662
Ian.

895
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:26,901
Please, let's finish it.

896
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,806
That's nice.

897
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,288
Mr. Towns.

898
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,026
Who's the boss of everyone?

899
01:22:56,704 --> 01:22:58,672
You are, Elliott.

900
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:02,367
You're the boss of everybody.

901
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,169
Now, can we please...

902
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,510
finish the airplane?

903
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:13,109
Please?

904
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:31,705
Careful.

905
01:23:42,116 --> 01:23:46,018
Did you clean the sand out of the engine
and do your preflight, Mr. Towns?

906
01:23:46,153 --> 01:23:49,520
- Three times.
- Well, do it again.

907
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,849
What the hell are they waitin' for?

908
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,044
They're waiting for us
to be too weak to fight back.

909
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,752
It's ready.

910
01:24:59,393 --> 01:25:01,224
Know what this looks like?

911
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:03,092
Like a plane.

912
01:25:03,197 --> 01:25:05,097
With wings and everything.

913
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:08,863
Think it'll fly?

914
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,600
I'll shit myself if it does.

915
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,271
Oh, it'll fly.

916
01:25:21,415 --> 01:25:23,383
It better.

917
01:25:47,608 --> 01:25:49,508
How you doing?

918
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:52,511
I'm thirsty, hungry and tired.

919
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:55,013
And I gotta get that thing
up in the air.

920
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,744
But otherwise,
I'm having a hell of a time.

921
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,752
How about you?

922
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:01,616
I'm laughing.

923
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:05,055
All I have to do is sit back,
relax and enjoy the flight.

924
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,963
You'll get us out of here.
I know you will.

925
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:18,962
Um, Frank,
I wanted to ask you something.

926
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,634
What did Alex say to you
just before he died?

927
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,113
"Don't crash. "

928
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:34,785
Take something only to cover yourselves
up with. Nothing more.

929
01:26:34,922 --> 01:26:38,449
Hey, where's the chart?
I want to tape it to the floor.

930
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,186
It's in my bag right there.

931
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:53,262
I need you to check these cables
one more time.

932
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,513
This the outfit you work for?

933
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,022
This catalog.

934
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:12,092
Yeah.

935
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:21,330
These are models.

936
01:27:22,369 --> 01:27:25,338
Wh... Where's the big stuff?

937
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,071
Uh, well...

938
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:33,078
there's the, uh...

939
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:35,080
Stealth Magnum.

940
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:37,810
I designed that one a few years ago.

941
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,385
The biggest we make...

942
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,422
would have to be the Albatross.

943
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,958
Horrible name.

944
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,052
It's a six-foot wingspan
parasol model.

945
01:27:49,196 --> 01:27:54,224
But it's not my design because it's a
glider, and I only work on power models.

946
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,963
But you design the big stuff too.
Right, Elliott?

947
01:27:57,071 --> 01:28:01,735
Planes that carry people.
Planes like the Phoenix. Right?

948
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:06,145
No, no.

949
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:09,216
Sizemore and Pratt
only build model airplanes.

950
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:14,487
But... that's who you design for.

951
01:28:14,588 --> 01:28:16,920
I'm their chief designer, yes.

952
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:21,653
You build toy planes, man?

953
01:28:21,762 --> 01:28:25,960
No, I most certainly
do not design toy planes.

954
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:32,632
A toy plane is one of those balsa wood
creations that run on a rubber band.

955
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,503
- Those are not toys.
- These are toys.

956
01:28:34,608 --> 01:28:36,132
Those are not toys.

957
01:28:36,243 --> 01:28:39,906
They're not full-sized aircraft either,
Elliott.

958
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,312
You see this shit?
He's a goddamn toy maker!

959
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:47,080
I think, Mr. Towns, you should appreciate
two very important things.

960
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,213
First of all, precisely similar
principles of aerodynamics...

961
01:28:50,357 --> 01:28:53,617
apply to both scale
and full-sized aircraft.

962
01:28:53,718 --> 01:28:54,818
What is he saying?

963
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:57,697
We should have waited, man.
We'd still have water left.

964
01:28:57,831 --> 01:29:00,464
Air foil surfaces,
lift-and-drag coefficients...

965
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:04,231
the whole pattern of heavier-than-air
construction are all precisely similar.

966
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:06,238
We're gonna die out here.

967
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:09,776
The second thing you should realize
is that a model plane has to fly itself.

968
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,606
There is no pilot.

969
01:29:11,712 --> 01:29:15,478
The design must be even more efficient
than that of a full-sized aircraft.

970
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:19,019
Well, I'm looking
through your catalog here...

971
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:23,249
and I don't see anything about
a flying sled with people on the wings!

972
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,358
They're toy airplanes!

973
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,553
What kind of crap is that?

974
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:31,028
My plane will fly.

975
01:29:31,131 --> 01:29:34,862
You knew all along that you
was buildin' a toy airplane!

976
01:29:41,575 --> 01:29:43,475
Ian!

977
01:29:43,577 --> 01:29:45,477
Ian, what are you doing?

978
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:49,242
We'd have had two more weeks
if it weren't for you.

979
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:52,985
They could have found us.

980
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,021
- The plane will fly!
- Ian, don't be stupid!

981
01:29:56,123 --> 01:29:59,854
We should have listened to Towns
in the beginning.

982
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,895
Sit tight, save water,
and they'll find us.

983
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,192
- What are you doing?
- But no.

984
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,234
- You had to build your plane.
- Frank!

985
01:30:08,335 --> 01:30:11,065
- Frank!
- And you're not even one of us.

986
01:30:11,171 --> 01:30:14,038
- Ian! Put that gun down!
- My plane will fly!

987
01:30:14,141 --> 01:30:16,632
- Ian!
- Nobody's shooting anybody!

988
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,644
We're not going out like that!

989
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,737
- My plane will fly!
- Give me the gun!

990
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:24,648
No, no, I was just saying,
I'm a very important person to them.

991
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,410
- Ian!
- They're looking for me.

992
01:30:26,511 --> 01:30:28,411
All they needed was more time.

993
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,915
We just needed more time!

994
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:34,152
- Ian! Ian!
- We need time!

995
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:37,025
Give me the gun! Give me that gun!

996
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:39,361
- My plane will fly!
- Come on.

997
01:30:46,473 --> 01:30:50,273
Everyone, look! Look!

998
01:30:57,217 --> 01:31:00,050
Holy shit.

999
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:10,363
I told you.

1000
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:14,000
I told you.

1001
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:17,968
We have to get inside!

1002
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,567
Inside! Get inside!

1003
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:38,189
Wait a minute!
All the weight's on the Phoenix!

1004
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,312
I can't believe it.

1005
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:08,421
We build a plane...

1006
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:13,026
we can't even fly it out of here.

1007
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:15,857
All that sand...

1008
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:17,931
it's probably not even gonna start.

1009
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:21,067
It'll start.

1010
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:31,343
Listen.

1011
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:33,413
We built this plane.

1012
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:38,543
With our own hands we built it.

1013
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,514
We can sure as hell dig it out.

1014
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,398
Did you hear what I said?

1015
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,368
We built it.

1016
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,973
We're not garbage.

1017
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,576
We're people...

1018
01:33:04,678 --> 01:33:06,646
with families...

1019
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,506
and lives to live.

1020
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,355
All of us.

1021
01:33:21,261 --> 01:33:23,491
I don't wanna die like this.

1022
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:29,134
Come on.

1023
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:31,636
Let's get the hell out of here.

1024
01:33:35,175 --> 01:33:36,938
Let's go home.

1025
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,470
Come on!

1026
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,510
Come on! Get up!

1027
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,485
Come on. Come on!

1028
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:39,665
All right, that's far enough.

1029
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:01,861
It's kinda beautiful, isn't it?

1030
01:35:01,995 --> 01:35:04,623
Don't tell us you wanna stick around.

1031
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:07,325
Not with you, I don't.

1032
01:35:11,738 --> 01:35:13,831
Whatever happens now...

1033
01:35:15,842 --> 01:35:18,367
we did something
pretty amazing here.

1034
01:35:19,713 --> 01:35:22,181
Yes, we did, didn't we?

1035
01:35:23,717 --> 01:35:25,685
Good luck.

1036
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,984
Uh...

1037
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:32,651
Captain Towns...

1038
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,197
we only have, uh...

1039
01:35:37,297 --> 01:35:39,959
five chances at this, so, uh...

1040
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,469
good luck.

1041
01:36:03,056 --> 01:36:05,024
Okay.

1042
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:16,268
Hey, Frank...

1043
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:18,770
I want you to borrow this.

1044
01:36:18,872 --> 01:36:21,670
It's always been good luck for me.

1045
01:36:23,877 --> 01:36:25,845
Who needs luck?

1046
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,347
Clear.

1047
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:05,841
Come on, baby. Come on.

1048
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:11,050
Come on!

1049
01:38:13,754 --> 01:38:16,882
Come on.

1050
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:38,672
- Come on.
- Come on.

1051
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:42,044
- Turn over.
- Yes!

1052
01:38:43,316 --> 01:38:45,284
Please!

1053
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:50,752
Come on!

1054
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:58,593
Shit.

1055
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:08,640
I'm gonna fire the next cartridge
with the ignition off...

1056
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:10,710
to clear the cylinders.

1057
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:16,571
But, Captain Towns,
there are only two left!

1058
01:39:16,683 --> 01:39:18,617
I know.

1059
01:39:19,686 --> 01:39:21,881
But I...

1060
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:43,805
Oh, shit!

1061
01:39:45,378 --> 01:39:47,676
Jesus!

1062
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:56,989
Okay.

1063
01:39:58,525 --> 01:40:00,493
Come on.

1064
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:09,367
Come on, baby.

1065
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:15,031
- Come on!
- Come on.

1066
01:40:15,141 --> 01:40:17,803
- Come on!
- Come on!

1067
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:20,573
Frank! Go rich on the fuel!

1068
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,046
Come on, baby!

1069
01:40:24,117 --> 01:40:27,382
Come on!

1070
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:30,251
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1071
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:32,290
Ohh!

1072
01:40:34,394 --> 01:40:36,362
Yes!

1073
01:40:38,098 --> 01:40:40,123
Yes! Come on!

1074
01:40:40,233 --> 01:40:43,964
- Yeah!
- Yes! We make our own luck!

1075
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:45,594
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on!

1076
01:40:45,705 --> 01:40:47,263
Yeah!

1077
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:52,539
Yes! Yes!

1078
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:56,138
Everybody! Up!

1079
01:40:56,249 --> 01:40:59,241
Let's go home! Come on!

1080
01:40:59,352 --> 01:41:02,446
- Yeah!
- Come on! Let's go!

1081
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:04,819
We're going home!

1082
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:15,263
Yes!

1083
01:41:16,369 --> 01:41:18,269
One for the lucky man!

1084
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:25,211
Thank you.

1085
01:41:49,869 --> 01:41:52,099
Mr. Towns!

1086
01:41:56,776 --> 01:41:58,903
Hang on!

1087
01:42:29,242 --> 01:42:33,042
- Towns, we have a problem!
- Elliott, where's my rudder? I've lost my rudder!

1088
01:42:33,146 --> 01:42:37,606
- That's what I'm trying to tell you!
- Well, stop talking and fix it!

1089
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:43,152
Shit.

1090
01:43:07,847 --> 01:43:09,815
Aah!

1091
01:43:22,195 --> 01:43:25,392
Towns, get us outta here!
This shit ain't funny no more!

1092
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,846
Here we go!

1093
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:14,779
Yeah!

1094
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:16,849
Hey, boy!

1095
01:44:20,653 --> 01:44:22,678
Yeah!

1096
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:28,388
We're flying! Yes!

1097
01:44:29,662 --> 01:44:31,562
Yes!

1098
01:44:31,664 --> 01:44:33,427
Whoo-hoo!

1099
01:44:39,973 --> 01:44:42,806
Yeah! Yeah!

1100
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:47,278
I'm comin' home, baby! I'm comin' home!
