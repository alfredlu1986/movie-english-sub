- Look after your carriage, mister.
- Oh, please, sir! Please!

21
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,200
Is this your daughter, madame?

22
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,800
I will take her, half cash down
and half in consuls.

23
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,400
Surely, Mama, you cannot sell me
to the highest bidder, though he is a lord.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Why ever not, child?

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
We cannot flout the rules
of good society.

26
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,700
Mind your backs. Excuse us.

27
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
<i>You can catch a lord
with 30,000...</i>

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,200
Is this an inconvenient moment?

29
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,700
I've returned for another look, Mr. Sharp,
but I can always come back another time.

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,600
<i>No need, my lord.
There it is.</i>

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,300
<i>Virtue Betrayed.</i>

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Look.
Look as long as you want.

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
- And the price?
- Four guineas, my lord. Just as I said.

34
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,300
They're all four guineas.

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,700
Not that one!
That one is 10!

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,700
<i>Virtue Betrayed is 10 guineas.</i>

37
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,700
- Oh, but that is too much, little miss.
- Good.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,900
The model was my late wife.
The child doesn't want to part with it.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,100
And if I give you 10 guineas
for this picture of your mother,

40
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,600
will you be happy then
to see it go?

41
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,400
No.
But it will be too much to refuse.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Hmph. Very well then.

43
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Ten guineas it shall be.

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Mark!

45
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,200
<i>I'm very much obliged, sir.</i>

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,300
<i>- Good day to you, Mr. Sharp.
- Good day, my lord.</i>

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,400
The orphanage can take her,
but I thought you might find her useful.

48
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,400
With both parents dead,
there's no one to fuss.

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,300
You can...
do what you like with the child.

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,300
Hmm.
How fluent is her French?

51
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,700
Oh, very.
Her mother was Parisian.

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,700
An opera girl.

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,500
I see.

54
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,400
Well, the less said
about that the better.

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Good-bye, Miss Sedley.
You are a credit to us.

56
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Take this copy of the great
Dr. Johnson's dictionary
as a token of our good wishes.

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Thank you,
Miss Pinkerton.

58
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,900
You've tidied the library?
Yes, Miss Green.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the sheet music?
It's all put away?

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, it is,
Miss Green.
Well, what about the study hall?

61
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,300
Have you swept it
thoroughly?
I have and for the last time.

62
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Don't be too sure, Miss Sharp.

63
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,500
Life can be very unpredictable.

64
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,200
Oh, I do hope so,
Miss Green.

65
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
<i>Miss Sharp,
I can't pretend to understand...</i>

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
why you prefer the post
of a country governess
to your position here.

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
- Can you not, Miss Pinkerton?
- And you feel quite ready to leave us?

68
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm glad to hear it.
Then good day to you,
Miss Sharp.

69
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,300
Good day.

70
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, Miss Pinkerton?

71
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,200
Am I not to have
myJohnson's dictionary?

72
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Very well.
Here you are.

73
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,000
Treat it as a symbol of the education
we have given you.

74
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,200
I certainly will,
Miss Pinkerton.

75
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
<i>Bye.!</i>

76
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
<i>Silly old trout.
She doesn't know a word of French,
though she's too proud to admit it.</i>

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
<i>Vive la France.!</i>

78
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Vive Napoleon!

79
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Becky, how can you be
so wicked and vengeful?

80
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,300
<i>And why not?
In all the years I spent there,</i>

81
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,300
I only ever knew
kind words from you.

82
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,300
<i>Revenge may be wicked,
but it's perfectly natural.</i>

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,800
<i>Perhaps it is.
But you're wrong to make me say so.</i>

84
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,300
<i>Never mind that.
Let's talk ofhow I'm to spend
my precious week of freedom.</i>

85
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,400
My first priority
is to form an opinion
of Captain Osborne.

86
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,900
<i>I take that duty
very seriously, you know.</i>

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It will not tax you.
George is quite perfect.

88
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,600
<i>- And so he should be. And your parents?
- Get on there.!</i>

89
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I must confess
I'm a little nervous of them.

90
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,500
Just be yourself
and everyone will love you.
I do.

91
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,400
- Tell me more about your brother.
- Jos?

92
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,300
There's nothing to add
to what you already know.

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,100
He's home on leave from India.
The position is a fine one.

94
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,100
<i>It has made him rich.</i>

95
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,700
But I'm afraid his life is a lonely one.

96
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,600
If only he were married.

97
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Come on! Get up!

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,500
And what children exactly...

99
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
are to have the benefit of
your instruction, Miss Sharp?

100
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,000
The daughters of Sir Pitt Crawley
of Queen's Crawley, ma'am.

101
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,000
<i>He's among the first
gentlemen of Hampshire.</i>

102
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,300
<i>Or so I was told
when I applied for the position.</i>

103
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Mmm.
He is not so prominent that
we have ever heard of him.

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Do you know the county at all?
No.

105
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,300
But that does not frighten me.
I love to visit new places.

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,800
- Really?
- Oh, indeed!

107
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,200
How I envy men who can explore for
themselves all the wonders of the world.

108
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,100
<i>And, uh, should you like
to visit India, do you think?</i>

109
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,700
<i>India?
I cannot think of anywhere
I'd rather see.</i>

110
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,700
The palaces of Delhi,
the Taj Mahal,
the Burning Ghats...

111
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,900
Have you made a study
of India, Miss Sharp?

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
<i>Not so much
as I would like.</i>

113
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm enraptured with every scent
and flavor of the East.

114
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,900
Oh, gad, if you think so.

115
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,000
Biju, fetch a plate.

116
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,400
<i>Becky, be careful.!
Those curries can burn.!</i>

117
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,400
So, Miss Sharp, how do you
find your first taste of India?

118
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,900

You've the voice of an angel

130
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
<i>Oh.
Yes.</i>

131
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,800
You must have some lessons,
my dear.

132
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
Captain Dobbin!

133
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,400
Is George not here?
Yes.
Where is my dear godson?

134
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,800
Pray don't concern yourselves.
George sends his regrets.

135
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,700
<i>- Work holds him prisoner.
- But he is coming to the picnic
at Vauxhall tomorrow?</i>

136
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,000
- Do please say that he is.
- Oh, he wouldn't miss it for worlds.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,700
Come to bed, now.

138
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,300
You must be finished
with all those boring
old numbers.

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,500
If only I could be.

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,700
I wish Jos wasn't
taking her to this silly
Vauxhall picnic.

141
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,700
He'll drink too much,
and who knows what he'll say
if the little minx works on him.

142
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,400
LetJos marry whom he likes.
She has no fortune,
but nor had you.

143
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,900
<i>Better her than a black
Mrs. Sedley from Boggley Wollah...</i>

144
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,900
and her dozen
mahogany grandchildren.
Now, now, now.

145
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,100
George,
your Amelia awaits.

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Ho-hum, Dobbs.

147
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,300
Unflagging devotion is all very well,
but it does rather take out the challenge.

148
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,300
So tell me, what is
the hanger-on governess like?

149
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,400
Amelia.
Miss Sharp.
Thank you.

150
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,600
Step carefully now.

151
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,100
<i>And here he is. It's George.</i>

152
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,500
My dear Amelia.
I can't tell you how much Becky
has been longing to meet you.

153
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,300
<i>I want to be quite sure you're
good enough for dear Amelia.</i>

154
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,500
And who's to decide? You?

155
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,400
Oh, but, Becky only meant...

156
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Come, Miss Becky.

157
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,400
May I show you the pavilion
and all the delights I've prepared for us?

158
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,100
You may show me anything
you choose, Mr. Sedley.

159
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,500
She was only joking.
I don't care for governesses
to joke at my expense.

160
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Miss Sharp! Miss Sharp!

161
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,900
I thought I was to help unravel your silks,
not to be sold into slavery.

162
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Nonsense, Mr. Sedley.

163
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Stay still, I beg you,
or I shall never have
them untangled.

164
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,700
I surrender.

165
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,400
I am your prisoner.

166
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,800
You have only to ask
and I shall release you.

167
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,100
But...
why would I ever want that?

168
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,500
Hmm.

169
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,500
I hopeJos isn't
getting in too deep.

170
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,100
Becky is my friend,
dearest George.

171
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,300
And I would welcome her
as a sister, as I hope you would.

172
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,600
<i>Biju, we're ready.
Hmm.</i>

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,200
Dearest Miss Sharp,
I give him to you.

174
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,800
What?
Your beautiful bird?

175
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
No, I couldn't!

176
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,400
You say you love everything
that comes from India.

177
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,700
Take him.

178
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,500
He is my ambassador.

179
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,000
Hello.

180
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,000
Amelia!

181
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Well?

182
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,500
He called me "dearest" twice,
and he squeezed my hand.

183
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,400
And look.
He gave me his precious bird.

184
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,900
- Well, surely that is a good sign.
- I know! I know!

185
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,900
Feel my heart,
how it beats.

186
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What are you playing at
with the little governess?

187
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,900
- Well, I told her I was...
- Jos. Jos.

188
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
You've forgotten
how these things work.

189
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,300
Do you think the fellas
down at the club...

190
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,300
would let their wives
dine with a governess?

191
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,500
Seriously, Jos,
if I'm to marry your sister...

192
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
lf?

193
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,800
<i>What are they talking about?
Can you guess?</i>

194
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Yes.
I think I probably can.

195
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,800
Oh, Becky, who knows?

196
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,500
It might turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

197
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,900
The disguise
is very convincing.

198
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,900
Good luck.

199
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,800
Here. This is for you.

200
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,500
Oh.
It's one of my father's.

201
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,300
I've nothing else to give.

202
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Oh, I couldn't.
Take it.

203
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,600
I want you to have it.

204
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,000
At least I know
it will be safe with you.

205
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, Becky!

206
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
<i>Good stuff! Inside!</i>

207
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,500
Off I go then.

208
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,700
Couldn't I pay for a seat inside?

209
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,700
They're all taken.
But don't worry.
I prefer the open air.

210
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>Hello, madame.
Hurry along now.!</i>

211
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,100
Bye!

212
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,800
<i>Get it on there.!</i>

213
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
<i>Queen's Crawley.!</i>

214
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Yes?

215
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,100
Can you tell Sir Pitt Crawley
that Miss Sharp has arrived.

216
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,200
And bring in my trunk
if you please.

217
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,900
- Miss Sharp?
- Yes, Miss Rebecca Sharp.

218
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,600
Governess to your master's children.
Now, will you kindly let me pass?

219
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
Certainly.

220
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,100
As for telling Sir Pitt,
there's no need.

221
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,300
Why not?
You've just told him yourself.

222
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,300
<i>♪ For these and all Thy other gifts ♪</i>

223
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,000

224
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,500
<i>♪ Amen ♪
Ah.!</i>

225
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>You haven't met Lady Crawley,
my dear.</i>

226
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,800
She's the girls' mother.
She's not the mother of my sons.

227
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,600
<i>Is she, Pitt? No.</i>

228
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Pitt's mother, my first wife,
she was the daughter of a lord,

229
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,300
<i>which makes him grander
than all of us put together,
doesn't it, Pitt?</i>

230
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,200
Whatever you say, sir.

231
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, yes. Very grand.

232
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,300
Too grand for me.
But this one ain't.

233
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,300
<i>Her father was an ironmonger,
wasn't he, my lady?</i>

234
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,100
<i>He was, sir.
Yeah.</i>

235
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,300
When shall we discuss
the girls' lessons?

236
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,900
My strengths are music,
drawing and French,

237
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
but I can teach them
whatever you wish.

238
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,900
You'll be kind to my girls,
Miss Sharp?

239
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh!

240
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,700
Don't worry. I'll treat them
just as sensitively as they deserve.

241
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,900
Hmph.
Hmph.

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,900
What is this?
It's, uh,

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,100
<i>"Potage de mouton à I'Ecossaise. '"</i>

244
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,000
<i>Oh, mutton broth.</i>

245
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,500
What sheep was it, Horrocks?
When did you kill?

246
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,500
One of the black-faced Scots, Sir Pitt.
We killed on Thursday.

247
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,900
Did she squeal?
Didn't she just.

248
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,100
Oh, good.
Always improves the flavor, that.

249
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,300
<i>Oh.
"To be honest, dearest Amelia,</i>

250

would think a baronet should be.

<i>No lights after 11:;00,

Go to bed in the dark,

254
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,900

for your candle every night, hmm?

255

Uh, Miss Sharp,

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I thought you might like to see
my pamphlet on the Chickasaw tribes.

<i>I swear, Mr. Crawley,

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,800
he's a soldier
through and through.

307
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,500
- I'm warned.
- Mm-hmm.

308
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,900
<i>With a little liquor, I can do it.</i>

309
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You must be bored
as a brick down here.

310
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,300
I have your father
and brother for company.

311
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,900
Precisely.

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,400
Not a great many laughs
in Miss Crawley, I can tell you.

313
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,500
I seem to remember
anchovy paste is a favorite delicacy
of yours, Aunt Tilly.

314
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,100
But not for do... doggies.

315
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't agree.
I suspect she's the quickest wit
in the room.

316
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,500
No, no, no.
I mean my brother, not my aunt.

317
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,200
They used to call him
"Miss Crawley" at Eton.

318
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,600
Go on. Admit it.

319
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,800
<i>He looks a little underweight.
He's the dullest dog
in shoe leather.</i>

320
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Really, Captain Crawley.

321
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,000
Are you trying to steer me
towards an indiscretion?

322
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Why?

323
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,400
Would you like me to?

324
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,600
No man has managed it yet.

325
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
- What was that?
- Nothing. A false note.

326
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,800
<i>Allez, Rose, Celia. Dépêchez.</i>

327
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,400
Faites vosà obeissances a votre tante.

328
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,300
<i>Don't waste your time,
Miss Sharp.</i>

329
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
All foreign languages
are ancient Greek to my sisters.

330
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,100
And they always will be
if they're not spoken before them.

331
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,100
I quite agree, Miss Sharp.
What a treat to find someone
cultured in this house.

332
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,700
<i>Vous parlez bien.
Merci.
My mother was French.</i>

333
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,700
A French mother?

334
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Now, that's altogether
too romantic for a governess.

335
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,600
Who was she?
Have you heard
of the Montmorencys?

336
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,000
<i>Who has not?</i>

337
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,500
<i>So, you're an impoverished aristocrat.</i>

338
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,200
Pity.
I had you down for an adventuress.

339
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,400
And are they mutually exclusive?

340
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,500
<i>Oh, please tell me there's something
disreputable in your past.</i>

341
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,700
Well, my father was an artist.

342
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Ah, that's better.
A starving one, I hope.

343
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,400
Absolutely ravenous.

344
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Who's ravenous... besides me?

345
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,300
Horrocks? When's dinner?
Any minute now,
Sir Pitt.

346
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Good.
I'd best excuse myself.

347
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Come along, girls.

348
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,000
- Is Miss Sharp not to dine with us?
- Well, don't ask me. Ask Pitt.

349
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
<i>Mm.
Nephew?</i>

350
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,200
I hope she's not banished
in my honor.

351
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,200
You know I am nothing
if not democratic.

352
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,300
It's no great sacrifice
in the cause of peace.

353
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Of course,
Miss Sharp must dine with us
if you wish it, Aunt.

354
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,600
Dinner is served!

355
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,800
Good!
Come along, my dear.
You'll sit by me.

356
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
And after dinner,
we shall abuse the company.

357
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,600
Really,
the hoops she makes
us jump through.

358
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,100
I don't mind, Mama.
I like Miss Sharp.
Mm.

359
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,600
Caesar liked Brutus
and look where it got him.

360
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,600
<i>- ♪All these and all Thy other gifts may...♪ 
- Pitt!</i>

361
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
Amen.

362
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,500
<i>Aunt Matilda,
you are the guest ofhonor.</i>

363
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,800
Um, what shall we drink to?

364
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,600
<i>Better food and a warmer room.</i>

365
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,900
Should we not drink to peace at
last... with Napoleon safe on Elba?

366
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,900
To the men who put him there...
to Wellington and Nelson.

367
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,300
<i>Wellington and Nelson.</i>

368
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,400
Wellington I grant you, hmm,

369
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,400
but, um, it is hard
to match Nelson's heroism...

370
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
<i>with his private life.</i>

371
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,800
<i>The life of Alexander
did not bear much scrutiny.</i>

372
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,600
Is he not a hero, either?
Quite right, Miss Sharp.

373
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,700
And to my mind, that was
the best part of Nelson's character!

374
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,900
He went to the deuce for a woman.

375
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,700
<i>There must be some good
in a man who'll do that.
Hmm.</i>

376
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,100
I adore imprudent matches.

377
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,100
- Wellington and Nelson.
- Wellington...

378
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Mm. You set no store
by birth, then?

379
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,100
<i>Birth?
Look at this family.!</i>

380
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,300
We've been
at Queen's Crawley
since Henry II,

381
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,600
but not one of us here
is as clever as Miss Sharp.

382
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,300
- To all the King's officers!
- All the King's officers!

383
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,300
The King's officers.

384
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,200
Mmm, lobster.

385
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,900
Delicious.

386
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,000
<i>Come in, my dear.
I've left my toadies in London.</i>

387
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,400
And what bores they are
downstairs.

388
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
It falls to you
to make me laugh.

389
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,600
She's clever enough,
isn't she, Firkin?

390
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,100
I think Miss seems
very clever.
Oh, yes.

391
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,100
If merit had its just reward,
you ought to be a duchess.

392
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,400
Mm.
You set no store by birth, then?

393
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Mm.

394
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,900
Silly old fool,
grabbing at my money
for her daughter's intended,

395
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,900
that hypocrite Pitt.

396
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
He should put down his Bible
and do the dirty work himself.

397
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,500
<i>With a decent position,
you could put the world on a leash.</i>

398
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,200
Perhaps I'll surprise you
and run away with a great man.

399
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,900
Oh, that'd be perfect.
I love elopements.

400
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,700
I've set my heart on Rawdon
running away with someone.

401
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,500
A rich someone
or a poor someone?

402
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,300
Well, above all,
a clever someone.

403
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,600
He's the dearest of creatures,
but not the wisest.

404
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,800
What's the matter?

405
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, it's the lobster.

406
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,000
They've poisoned me
with the lobster.

407
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,500
Off you go.

408
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,100
<i>Sir Pitt? Mm.</i>

409
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,200
<i>Can I not be of any assistance?</i>

410
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,900
<i>L- I don't think so, madam.
The doctor is with her now.</i>

411
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,500
The best we can do
is pray, pray for her soul.
Mm.

412
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000
And for her
hundred thousand.
Ohh.

413
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,200
<i>Will she live, Doctor?</i>

414
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,800
<i>Well, I've pumped her.
I've purged her.</i>

415
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,400
There's nothing more I can do.

416
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,200
Now, it rests with the Lord.

417
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,500
Uh, would you like to settle
with me now, Sir Pitt?

418
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,700
Tomorrow,
if you don't mind, Doctor.

419
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,900
I only pays on results.

420
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,800
<i>How do I look?</i>

421
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
A good deal stronger.
They will be disappointed.

422
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Lady Southdown hovers
at the door night and noon.

423
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500
"Mm-mm, I always travel
with my medicine chest.

424
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,700
"Can I not be of any assistance...

425
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,500
with my special tonics?"

426
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
<i>That's a dose I doubt I'd live through.</i>

427
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,400
Nonsense!
It's Captain Rawdon
that needs you dead.

428
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,800
Lady Southdown and Mr. Pitt Crawley
want you well enough to change your will.

429
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,500
Rebecca Sharp,
I've made up my mind.

430
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,000
You must come with me
to London.

431
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,500
I insist upon it,
and so does Byron.

432
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,400
And we won't be gainsaid,
will we?

433
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,300
But what could I say
to dear Sir Pitt,
after all his kindness?

434
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
Oh, leave him to me.

435
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,400
When a man has two sons
and a rich spinster sister,

436
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,000
he seldom gainsays her,
my dear.

437
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,400
Must you go, Rawdon?
Uh, l-I thought you might stay
for some shooting.

438
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Oh, no. I... I thought it best
to see them safely back home...

439
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,500
to, uh, Mayfair.

440
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,800
Clear the way, there!

441
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,500
There she goes,
the best little governess
the girls ever had.

442
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,100
Mm, mm.
Suppose I better write to
Miss Pinkerton for a replacement.

443
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Let me, Sir Pitt.

444
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,000
Mm, Miss Pinkerton is an old friend,
and I should so like to be useful.

445
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,400
Mm.

446
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,100
Meddlesome old cat.

447
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,100
<i>"My dear, Miss Pinkerton, mm.</i>

448
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,800
<i>"Apupil of yours has recently
come to my notice, mm.</i>

449
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,100
<i>"I should so like to know
more ofher history.</i>

450
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
<i>Her name is Rebecca Sharp. '"</i>

451
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,200
The governor will miss you.

452
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,800
Sir Pitt has been good to me.

453
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,800
Who wouldn't be?

454
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,400
Apples! Juicy apples!
Come on, people!
Juicy apples!

455
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,500
Welcome to London.

456
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,100
<i>Oh, goodness.! Look busy.
The mistress is home.!</i>

457
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,200
Here we are, my dear.

458
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,800
Who was that?

459
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,500
It's my neighbor,
the Marquess of Steyne.
Why?

460
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,200
No reason.

461
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,600
Are you going out?
I'm meeting Tarquin and Villiers.

462
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,100
<i>And the rest of the chaps.</i>

463
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
We might play some billiards.
Ah, yeah.

464
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Lord Tarquin
and the HonorableJohn Villiers.

465
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
It is not done to pronounce
"the Honorable" aloud.

466
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,700
Well, well.
You know these things
better than I.

467
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,500
What I wonder is: Do they ask
you to their homes, these chaps?

468
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,500
Do you meet their mothers
and their sisters?

469
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,800
Sometimes.

470
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,600
Because you shall not want,
you know?

471
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,400
The British merchant's son
shan't want.

472
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,900
<i>You may marry whom you please
and keep her well.
Father.</i>

473
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
George is engaged.
It's understood...

474
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,900
Then it can be un-understood.

475
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,700
Don't you see, boy?

476
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,100
There's nothing you can't have
if you will reach for it.

477
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,800
Why not a viscount's daughter?
Better yet, an earl's.

478
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,800
Or marry an heiress
and buy a peerage for yourself!

479
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,600
You shouldn't read in a carriage.
It will make you sick.

480
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,600
Reading always makes me sick.

481
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,300
Who's it from?

482
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,500
My friend, Amelia Sedley.

483
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,700
I thought she might have set a date
for her marriage, but it seems not.

484
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,300
And who is her intended?
Captain George Osborne.

485
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,800
Osborne?

486
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,200
Any relation to the Duke of Leeds?

487
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,500
Oh, no, ma'am.
He's a tradesman's son.

488
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,700
Oh!
I know Osborne.

489
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,700
He's in one of the line regiments.
He's as green as this grass...

490
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,600
<i>and will go to the deuce
to be seen with a lord.</i>

491
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Captain Osborne's vanity
must make him a tempting victim.

492
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,200
I say, Aunt. Why don't we do
Miss Sharp a favor...

493
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,500
and invite them over?
If you think it would be amusing.

494
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I am glad to see
Miss Crawley knows your worth.

495
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,900
As long as George knows yours.
Of course he does.

496
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,100
<i>- Shall I play for you?
- Oh, thank you, my dear.</i>

497
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Rawdon, will you explain
the rules of piquet to Miss Sedley?

498
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,800
- I've quite forgotten.
- Be careful, Amelia.

499
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,500
Captain Crawley
knows his cards.
I'm warned.

500
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Oh, there are
no fortunes in piquet.

501
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,600
All the same, be kind to her.
She is my only friend.

502
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,800
Not your only friend,
Miss Sharp.

503
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,500
<i>Rawdon, you explain.</i>

504
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>Now, come along.</i>

505
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>- You may discard up to five.
- Oh, do go away.</i>

506
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,100
So, Miss Sharp.

507
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,700
- How do you like your new place?
- My place?

508
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
How kind of you to remind me.

509
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
It's quite tolerable, thank you.

510
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,100
And they treat me very well.

511
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
But then,
this is a gentleman's family...

512
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,000
and quite a change
from tradespeople.

513
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,200
You seemed to like tradespeople
well enough last year.

514
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Joseph Sedley, you mean?
It's true.

515
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,700
If he'd asked me,
I would not have said no.

516
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,900
How very obliging of you.

517
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,500
I know what you're thinking.

518
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,300
What an honor to have had you
for a brother-in-law.

519
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,100
Captain George Osborne,
son ofJohn Osborne, Esquire,

520
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,700
son of...
what was your grandfather?

521
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,800
Never mind.
You cannot help your pedigree.

522
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,700
<i>Miss Sharp.
Come and take over from Rawdon.</i>

523
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,500
He's worse than useless.

524
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Ah, 'tis true.
This is not my game.

525
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,300
Osborne, would you care to come
and play something a little more grown up?

526
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,600
Bye!

527
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,300
Do thank
Miss Crawley for us!
Crawley. Miss Sharp.

528
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,100
Are you cross with me?

529
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,100
Cross? I could kiss you.

530
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,900
To see George Osborne fleeced
makes the perfect end to the perfect day.

531
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh, dear!

532
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,600
I was rather hoping
the evening wasn't over yet.

533
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,200
Oh?

534
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,100
I was wondering...

535
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,800
if you might like to
show me your room.

536
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,000
Of course.

537
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,800
I'll run and ask
Miss Crawley's permission.

538
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,600
Don't joke.

539
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,200
Really, Captain.

540
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,000
You cannot imagine I would do anything
to incur your aunt's displeasure.

541
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,700
I thought you and I
had an understanding.

542
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,300
Well, I understand this.

543
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,700
Two men and two men only
will enter my bed chamber...

544
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,700
my husband and the doctor.

545
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,200
You know my heart, Becky.

546
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,400
You know
I'd do anything for you.

547
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm flattered.

548
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,800
But Aunt Tilly's
views on these things
came out of the Ark.

549
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,400
That's not how she sounds.
Oh, don't be deceived.

550
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,600
She talks like Oliver Cromwell
but thinks like Charles I,

551
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,700
and, believe me,
it's an outside wager
she'll ever change her mind.

552
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,700
It's lucky, then, Captain,

553
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,900
that you're a gambling man...

554
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,800
and no stranger
to taking a chance.

555
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,600
"Dearest Becky, a letter from Jos
arrived from India this morning...

556
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,300
filled with regrets
about a certain person."

557
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,800
Has Miss Sharp
taken to Mayfair?

558
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,200
She seems quite at home
in her new life.

559
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,400
I do not doubt it.

560
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,100
I had thought her
a mere social climber.

561
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,700
I see now
she's a mountaineer.

562
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,500
"I should tell him, dear Becky,

563
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,700
"he has missed his chance
for his goddess has acquired
other suitors.

564
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
<i>Your loving friend,
Amelia Sedley. '"</i>

565
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,700
Aahhh.

566
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,900
This one's for you.
It's from Mr. Pitt.
Read it.

567
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,000
"Dear Aunt,
I have both happy
and sad news to relay.

568
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,500
"The good news
is that I'm married.

569
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,000
LadyJane Sheepshanks has done me
the honor of becoming my wife."

570
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,300
Well, no great surprise there.

571
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,300
Well, she's a nice enough girl.

572
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
Although, I don't envy him
his mother-in-law.

573
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,200
What's the bad news?

574
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,000
"I am sorry to tell you
that my stepmother, Lady Crawley,
has gone to a better place."

575
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,700
After Queen's Crawley,
almost anywhere's a better place.

576
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,200
Come on!
The best thing for you, my girl,
would be...

577
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,400
No, no. Too strict.

578
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,400
Hmm. Thank you.

579
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,400
Madam,

580
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,200
would you consider, um...

581
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,500
Good gracious!
Here's Sir Pitt!
Oh, my dear, l-l-I can't see him.

582
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,800
My mood,
my nerves won't stand it.

583
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,600
<i>- Go away.!
- Yes, Sir Pitt.</i>

584
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,900
<i>Ah, good.!</i>

585
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,600
It's-It's not Miss Crawley
I want to see, it's you.

586
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,800
You have to come back
to Queen's Crawley.

587
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,300
You've heard my news?
Only just now.

588
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm very sorry.
If there's anything I can do...

589
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,100
There is. There's plenty for you to do.
Everything's wrong since you left.

590
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,800
You must come back!
Well...

591
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,800
Marry me!

592
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,200
<i>Come back as Lady Crawley,
if you like.</i>

593
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,900
But do come back!

594
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,800
What? Oh!

595
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,700
- Don't leave me down here forever.
- Oh, Sir Pitt.

596
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,200
I can't.
Can't or won't?

597
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,300
Wouldn't you like to be
an old man's darling?

598
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,000
No, Sir Pitt, I really can't.

599
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,300
The truth is, I'm married already.

600
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,000
Married?

601
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,600
Oh well, it was worth a try.

602
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,900
Well, what a chance is lost!

603
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,300
Never mind, my dear,
we'll set him up,
won't we, brother?

604
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,200
I'll buy him a shop
or commission a portrait.

605
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,700
Whoever he is, he and his family
are very lucky to have you.

606
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,200
- I hope you think so.
- Indeed I do.

607
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,500
Then if you cannot take me
for a wife and sister,

608
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,700
will you not love me
as daughter and niece?

609
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,900
What?

610
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Dear Sir Pitt,
dearest Miss Crawley, it's true.

611
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,000
I've married Rawdon.

612
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,000
Rawdon!

613
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
My... Rawdon?

614
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,200
Coal!
Pick 'em up, boy.

615
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,300
<i>Look after her, Firkin.</i>

616
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,300
Poor, dear Miss Crawley.
I do worry so.

617
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,000
Don't waste your syrup
on me, Miss Sharp.

618
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,700
Just get back in the knife box
where you belong.

619
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,900
<i>Are you all right, Miss?
I will be if you're going past Baker Street.</i>

620
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,900
<i>Would that be proper, Miss?</i>

621
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
More proper than
standing here in the street.

622
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
Now give us a hand
with the trunk.

623
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,500
<i>You...</i>

624
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,100
We'll be in Queer Street
if she don't come round.

625
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,600
I'd rather be in Queer Street with you
than Park Lane with any other.

626
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,300
But, Rawdon, she will come round.
She said herself, she'd love you to elope.

627
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,300
It's all talk, you know.

628
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,800
She loves romance in her novels,
but not in her family.

629
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,200
Where they're concerned,
she's as snobbish as Queen Charlotte.

630
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,800
Well, then...

631
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,000
We'll have to send
an ambassador to plead our case.

632
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,400
Oh, yes?
Mm.

633
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,200
What kind of ambassador
would that be?

634
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:42,000
I'd say a very little one,

635
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:47,400
with rosy cheeks and blue eyes,

636
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,300
and probably not too much hair.

637
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,900
What?

638
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,700
You mean...

639
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,300
Oh, you brilliant, darling girl.

640
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,600
Well, that will mend fences
if nothing else will.

641
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,200
Oh, Becky!

642
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,000
When one thinks of how she tended you.

643
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,200
And all the time...
Oh, I should have guessed that
nobody does anything for nothing.

644
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,500
But for a pauper's daughter,
a penniless governess,

645
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,800
<i>to make off with my Rawdon.
Ohh.</i>

646
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,000
Oh, dear.

647
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,500
Oh, at least her mother was a Montmorency.
I suppose we must cling to that.

648
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,900
Not a bit of it. I have it
on the best authority.

649
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,000
Her mother was an opera girl
in the chorus at Montmartre!

650
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,000
- What?
- I have it on the best authority.

651
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,900
Yes, yes, yes! All right!

652
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, very well. I know what I must do.

653
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,800
Would you be so kind
as to bring my little desk here?

654
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,400
Certainly. Where is it?
Where's her little desk? I can't see it.

655
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,700
It's over here.

656
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,900
<i>- I almost feel sorry for poor Rawdon.
- Mm...</i>

657
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,400
But I cannot let that girl
profit from her scheming.

658
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,400
Nor should you.

659
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,500
I'm glad to see that
you've changed your opinions.
Firkin.

660
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Do you remember when
you told us all at Queen's Crawley...

661
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,900
That you adored imprudent marriages?

662
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,300
Not in real life.

663
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,500
What do you want?
Time, Osborne, that's what I want.

664
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,000
<i>I owe you nothing.!
I will give you nothing.!</i>

665
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,300
<i>You owe me friendship.!
You have no friendship
coming from me, sir.!</i>

666
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Oh!

667
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,800
<i>Do we have enough of this china?</i>

668
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,100
It's to be a buffet and I don't
want to risk the Crown Derby.

669
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
Oh, listen to this.

670
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,700
"Emperor Napoleon Escapes
from Elba and Marches on Paris.

671
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,200
<i>Allies Prepare for War. '"</i>

672
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,900
- Amelia, what's the matter, dear?
- Will it affect George?

673
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,900
Well, he's a soldier, isn't he,
for all his swagger,

674
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,800
and there's more to soldiering
than gold braid and regimental dinners.

675
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,800
Amelia?

676
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,400
Amelia!
Oh!

677
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,600
If she means to be a soldier's wife,
she must learn to bear such things.

678
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,500
<i>Now, I've been thinking about...
I must tell you.
I can put it off no longer.</i>

679
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,000
We're ruined, Mary. Lost.

680
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,300
<i>Everything is gone.
But we're giving a soiree.</i>

681
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,600
There'll be no more soirees
or balls or dinners either.

682
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,700
That life, finished for us.

683
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,100
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

684
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,500
<i>The debt that finished me, the man
who tipped me into the abyss,</i>

685
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,100
is none other than
George's father, John Osborne.

686
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,300
<i>By order of the trustees of the Sedley
Estate, this auction will now commence.</i>

687
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,700
<i>Lot 368, an inlaid ebony writing desk.</i>

688
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,100
<i>Shall we say... four guineas? Five?</i>

689
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,400
<i>Any more? Come on.
Going, going...</i>

690
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,000
Sold.

691
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,600
Lot 369.

692
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,800
<i>A Clemency
Drawing Room Piano.</i>

693
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,000
I sang to that.
Would you like it?

694
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,700
We will start at three guineas.
Four?

695
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,000
- Five.
- Five at the back.

696
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,900
- Six.
- It's Captain Dobbin.

697
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,800
<i>Seven? Eight?
I know him.
He's in the Ninth.</i>

698
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,600
<i>Nine? Ten.</i>

699
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,400
<i>Any more?
Sold to the captain.</i>

700
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,700
Lot 370.

701
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,600
<i>A landscape painting signed,
"Francis Sharp, 1801. '"</i>

702
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,900
What? What's the matter?
My father painted it.

703
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,200
<i>I gave it to Amelia.</i>

704
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,000
<i>- I'll get it for you.
- Shall we say, five guineas?</i>

705
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,000
<i>Six, at the back. Seven.</i>

706
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,700
Eight. Nine.

707
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,100
Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

708
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,000
<i>Thirteen. Fourteen.</i>

709
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,000
<i>Fifteen, at the back.</i>

710
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,700
<i>Going once. Going twice...
Leave it.
It doesn't matter.</i>

711
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,100
Sold for 15 guineas
to the Marquess of Steyne.

712
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,700
<i>Why would Lord Steyne
bother with a little auction like this?</i>

713
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,700
He collects my father's works.

714
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,000
A true collector will go anywhere
to get what he wants.

715
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,800
An amboyna and rosewood
quartetto table.

716
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,800
- Captain Dobbin.
- Miss Sharp.

717
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,900
I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Crawley. Crawley.

718
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
Are you taking up
the piano, Captain?

719
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,000
<i>I have a... friend who will
get some use of it, I think.
Any more?</i>

720
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,200
- Indeed she will.
- Good day.

721
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,300
Going... Sold.

722
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,300
<i>I saw Miss Sharp
at the auction this morning.</i>

723
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,800
How is George?

724
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,200
George is well, I think. But busy.

725
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,400
Too busy to come here.

726
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,100
I'll fetch some tea.

727
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,700
When you next see him,
will you give him this?

728
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
I painted it.

729
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,700
It's not wrong, is it, to remind him
of the one who loves him most?

730
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,500
Of course not.

731
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh, look what he's done!
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

732
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
I can't believe it!

733
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,900
Oh, thank God!
Thank God!

734
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,900
Mama! It's all right!

735
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,100
George has bought me the piano,
and he'll be here directly.

736
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Oh, thank God!

737
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,600
I tell you, George, you must go to her.

738
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,000
She's dying.

739
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,900
Miss Sedley asked me to give you
this when I saw you next.

740
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,200
For God's sake, George.
You haven't even opened it.

741
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,300
No need.

742
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,400
They're all the same.

743
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,200
<i>Georgy.! What are you playing at?
We're waiting for you.</i>

744
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,300
<i>Good day to you, Captain Dobbin.
I'm just leaving, sir.</i>

745
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,300
Good.
There's a friend of Maria's
they want me to meet.

746
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,700
Ah, uh, may I present
my son, George?

747
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,800
This is Miss Rhoda Swartz.

748
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Miss Rhoda was talking aboutJamaica
and her sugar plantations there.

749
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,800
Although I don't remember it.

750
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,800
I left when I was three.

751
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,900
Maria, may I borrow you
for a moment, please?

752
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,100
Can you forgive us?

753
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,400
Your father does not much
trouble to conceal his plans.

754
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,100
Which are?
For us to marry, of course.

755
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,700
Indeed.

756
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,000
Come. Sit by me.

757
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,700
Let us speak frankly.

758
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,000
My fortune is great, my birth is not.

759
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,100
So, I must choose
between a poor nobleman...

760
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,700
or a rich bourgeois like you.

761
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,200
Upon my word, you've
a very precise grasp of the matter.

762
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,900
<i>I would have liked a title.</i>

763
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,700
But my guardian says,
if you and I combine our fortunes,

764
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,800
we may buy one
whenever we wish.

765
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,500
I cannot believe you are
seriously suggesting Miss Swartz...

766
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,500
as the companion of
my heart and hearth!

767
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,600
Why not?

768
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,500
Well, to begin with,
she's not English.

769
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,200
Hoity-toity!
Less fastidious, if you please!

770
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,300
What's a shade or two of tawny when
there's half a million on the table?

771
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,600
<i>Why, with that money, we'll have you
in the House of Lords in no time.</i>

772
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,800
<i>Just think. Dining at Kew,
dancing at Carlton House.</i>

773
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,400
- And what of honor?
- Honor?

774
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,400
<i>Yes. Honor.</i>

775
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,600
You may buy a string of ancestors
to hang upon your walls,

776
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,400
but I see you have not bought
the breeding that goes with them.

777
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,200
- You made me give my word to Amelia.
- Be silent, sir!

778
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,500
You dare speak
that object's name to me?

779
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,600
"Dare," sir, is not a word to be
used to a captain in the British army.

780
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,700
For I am a gentleman,
though I am your son.

781
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,600
I'll say what I like to my own child.
And I say this:

782
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,900
I have not slaved for 40 years
to see you marry a beggar maid!

783
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,900
You made the match!
And I can unmake it!

784
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,100
You will marry whom I say, sir.
And I say you will marry Miss Swartz.

785
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:32,600
<i>Either that or take your pack and walk
out of this house without a shilling.!</i>

786
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,100
Do I make myself clear, sir?

787
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,900
As a bell, sir.

788
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,900
<i>Georgy. Georgy.</i>

789
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,100
<i>Come on, you lads.!
War is come to Europe.!</i>

790
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,200
<i>My brother wants tojoin.!</i>

791
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,600
If you're here to plead his case,
you've made a wasted journey.

792
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,800
Mr. Osborne, we're on the brink of war.

793
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,600
Should anything happen to George,
you'd never forgive yourself
if you hadn't parted in charity.

794
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,800
May I not take him
a message from you? Please.

795
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,700
Very well.

796
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,000
Let him only come home to his old room
and things will be as they were before.

797
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,400
They cannot be.

798
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,400
Why not, if I say they can?
Because...

799
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,900
George married
Miss Sedley this morning.

800
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,200
I go from here to
their wedding breakfast.

801
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,400
Will you not come with me?

802
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,300
Welcome, Mr. Sedley.
Sedley. Welcome home.

803
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,800
- Crawley.
- Righto.

804
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,400
Mrs. Crawley.
So,

805
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,400
have you found many changes
since your last visit from India?

806
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,000
Some.

807
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,300
And one in particular
that I regret very much.

808
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,600
<i>Dobbin.! Osborne.!</i>

809
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,700
There's news here for all of us.
It's the order for Belgium.

810
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,100
<i>We embark next week.</i>

811
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,900
Men need war like the soil
needs turning. I'll enjoy it!

812
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,900
You're surely not going
over there in your condition?

813
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Of course I'm going!
Why should the men have all the fun?

814
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,400
And didn't Eleanor of Aquitaine ride
into battle pregnant and bare-breasted?

815
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,900
<i>By Gad, if there's a woman alive
who could do the same, it's you.!</i>

816
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,500
<i>Be careful of the model, Mrs. Crawley.</i>

817
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,100
Queen Eleanor was
locked up by her husband.

818
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,600
And emerged from her prison
to govern England.

819
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,200
Bravo.

820
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:25,300
What about you, Sedders? Will you
be joining us on our little excursion?

821
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,500
<i>If it weren't for my duties in India,
I'd be over there like a shot. Oh yes.!</i>

822
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,000
- I'll go.
- You cannot.

823
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,500
<i>Well, why shouldn't she?
She can keep Becky company.</i>

824
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,900
- To victory!
- Victory!

825
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,800
- Victory!
- To victory.

826
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,000
We won't know anyone.
Whose fault is that?

827
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,100
If you would only put yourself out
to be civil once in a while.

828
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,400
The Crawleys have been here
no longer than us, and Mrs. Crawley's
the talk of the town.

829
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,300
Is that what you would have me be,
the "talk of the town"?

830
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,200
<i>Here comes the famous Mrs. Crawley.</i>

831
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,300
<i>Why she is famous
is a mystery to me.</i>

832
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,200
Why does everyone receive her,
as for General Tufto?

833
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,300
<i>He must find her
command of French useful.</i>

834
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:03,300
<i>- I know I should.
- A real lady wouldn't speak it half as well.</i>

835
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,600
- Hush, my dear.
- Lady Darlington. Lady Bareacres.

836
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,300
Good evening, Mrs. Crawley.
Good evening.

837
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,400
You're making an exhibition of yourself.

838
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,000
Good evening.
Good evening.

839
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,400
Can I leave you in charge?
I see some sheep that need shearing.

840
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,300
Go. You manage our income,
and I'll see to your career.

841
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,400
Wait here a minute.

842
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,500
George, I feel... I feel sick.

843
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,900
General Tufto.
Mrs. Crawley.

844
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,400
Can I tempt you
with some refreshment?
That would be delightful.

845
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,600
Mrs. Crawley.
Yes, good evening.

846
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,800
I hope your dance card
isn't quite filled yet.

847
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,700
- Hardly. I've just arrived.
- I am the early bird, then.

848
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,200
<i>And I, presumably, the worm?</i>

849
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:18,000
General Tufto, this is
Captain Osborne of the Ninth.

850
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,600
That is Osborne with an "E."
Make sure you spell it right...

851
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,700
when you mention him
in dispatches.

852
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,900
If only spelling
was my forte.

853
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,800
My dear, please.
Thank you.

854
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,400
Would you like me to fetch you
some water? Or a chair?

855
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
Or a doctor?

856
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,300
Is Amelia all right?

857
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,100
<i>I expect so. Dobbin's with her.</i>

858
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,200
Shouldn't you have more care of her now?

859
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,400
You mean, now that yet another
rope has come to bind me?

860
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,700
You're not like Amelia, Mrs. Crawley.

861
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,100
Nothing will quench your fire.

862
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,200
Captain Osborne.

863
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,500
Will you fetch me
my shawl and my nosegay?

864
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,900
Of course.

865
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,000
I wish you'd let me come with you.
No. I mean it. Go back at once.

866
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,500
I'll tell George you're safe.
Don't.

867
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,800
It will only annoy him
that I've left the ball early.

868
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,300
But why did he bring you at all?

869
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,500
Just tell me you're happy.

870
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,300
We're happy enough.

871
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,600
How prettily the Duchess
has arranged things.

872
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:48,400
She always does. Or don't you go
to her parties back in England?

873
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,900
No matter. We won't
know her back in London.

874
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,600
- I see you've been busy.
- Very.

875
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,500
Osborne.
Crawley.

876
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,500
Ready for a hand
or two of cards?

877
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,200
- If Mrs. Crawley...
- Of course.

878
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,500
I'll leave you to it, gentlemen.

879
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,900
<i>- George, don't drink anymore.
- Nonsense, Dobbs.</i>

880
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,500
Come and have a drink yourself,
and light up your lantern jaw.

881
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,100
<i>What's happening?</i>

882
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,200
Your Grace. My lords,
ladies and gentlemen.

883
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,700
The enemy is past the River Sambre
and our left is already engaged.

884
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,900
<i>We march in three hours.</i>

885
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:31,200
- Becky!
- Rawdon! Rawdon!

886
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,700
I'm not afraid, but I'm
a big target for a shot.

887
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,300
And if I should go down,
I want you to know what there is.

888
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,600
I've had a good run here,
so you've a wad of money.

889
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,100
There's a horse left to sell, and...

890
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,900
well, those trunks
are worth 30 alone.

891
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,100
You mean, we owe 30 on them.

892
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,600
Yes.

893
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:11,200
Well, I'll wear me old uniform,
so you can sell the new one.

894
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,900
What with the saddles,
guns, rings and...

895
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,600
and this little lot...

896
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,700
you'll have enough
to keep you dry,

897
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,100
<i>get you back to London before...
I'll manage.</i>

898
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:29,300
Won't you just.

899
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:33,700
There never was a woman
who could manage like you,
Becky Sharp.

900
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,300
You won't do anything brave, will you?

901
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,300
Promise?

902
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,900
What?

903
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,600
Tears?

904
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,700
Tears from my strong little Becky?

905
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,500
I'm a woman in love, aren't I?

906
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,600
Oh, my darling.

907
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,000
<i>If you should awake
to find me dead...</i>

908
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,200
Shh!

909
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,900
You must be sure, at least, of this:

910
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,800
That you are a woman
who has been truly loved.

911
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,700
<i>S'il vous plaît. Aidez-nous.</i>

912
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,100
<i>Somebody, please sell us a horse.!</i>

913
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,300
Mrs. Crawley! Mrs. Crawley,
over here, if you please!

914
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,900
Lady Bareacres. What a surprise.

915
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,300
We sent our servant to the inn
to look for a horse,

916
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,900
but the only one left
is Captain Crawley's.

917
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,000
Fancy.

918
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:39,400
- What will you take for it?
- Nothing from you, my lady.

919
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,500
Don't be silly, my dear.
We've always been friends, haven't we?

920
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,000
- No. We have not.
- Now listen to me.

921
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:53,300
You can come with us if you wish,
but we must, and will, have that horse!

922
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,100
- Hmph!
- Why couldn't you be civil to the woman?

923
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,300
<i>Mrs. Crawley.!
Mrs. Crawley, come back, please.!</i>

924
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,100
<i>Mrs. Crawley.! Discretion
being the better part of valor,</i>

925
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,800
- I'm afraid it is time to quit Brussels.
- Are we really losing, Lord Darlington?

926
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,300
They say the enemy
has broken through the lines.

927
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:23,900
Which brings me to my point.
Did you sell Lady Bareacres your horse?

928
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,700
Doesn't anyone love me for myself alone?

929
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,300
You may buy it if you give me
a seat in your carriage.

930
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,800
- Done.
- Quickly! We must get it.

931
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,600
<i>- Why must she come with us?
- First, because I like her.</i>

932
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,600
Second, she's pregnant.

933
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,600
Third, it's the condition
upon which she gave us the horse.

934
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,600
Mrs. Crawley, hurry!
We must leave now!

935
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,100
Now! Please!

936
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,500
<i>Please.! Help me.!
Has anyone seen George Osborne?</i>

937
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,900
One moment.

938
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:15,200
<i>George Osborne of the Ninth.!
Please.!</i>

939
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,500
Amelia! What are you doing?

940
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,400
You shouldn't be out here!
Come along.

941
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,800
<i>Mrs. Crawley.!
Come now, if you're coming.!</i>

942
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,100
Lord Darlington, is there
room for Mrs. Osborne?

943
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,400
Only if you give up your place.

944
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,300
Don't worry about me. I'll wait
here for George, whatever comes.

945
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,300
We'll meet again in London.

946
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,700
Well, I do hope so.
Good luck to you.

947
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,100
Drive! Drive!

948
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,800
There must be news of my George!

949
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,300
Amelia, you must
take hold of yourself!

950
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,700
We're soldier's wives.
We live with uncertainty.

951
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,100
How would you feel if
you had spent last night alone...

952
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,700
while your husband danced
with another woman?

953
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:16,900
If you have stolen his last evening
from me, I shall never forgive you!

954
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,200
How could you say such a thing?
I won't listen to it.

955
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,500
If you must hear the truth,
your George is not...

956
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,700
What?
My George is not what?

957
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,000
Is not the man to see you risk
your health... or his baby.

958
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,500
Come inside,
and we'll wait together.

959
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,000
What would Miss Pinkerton
say of us now?

960
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,900
Two mothers-to-be
in the midst of a war.

961
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:20,000
<i>Not quite what we studied
in etiquette class.</i>

962
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,500
Are you frightened?

963
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,200
Of giving birth, I mean.

964
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:31,600
Hmm. You know me.
I'm tough as a nut.

965
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,000
I'll probably have my baby after tea and
then dance at a ball the same evening.

966
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm not frightened, either.

967
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,200
At least, not for myself.

968
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,000
As long as George's child is well.

969
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,500
It's the bagpipes.

970
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,100
<i>- But... that means...
- Victory.</i>

971
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,200
Victory!

972
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:28,400
<i>"My dearest father,
though we parted in anger,</i>

973
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,100
<i>I want you to know I will not disgrace
you in the challenge that lies ahead. '"</i>

974
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,200
Mr. Osborne. Mr. Osborne.

975
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
Captain Dobbin.

976
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,300
Rather, I beg your pardon, Major Dobbin,
since better men than you are dead...

977
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,700
and you've stepped
into their shoes.
Better men are dead.

978
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,800
I wish to speak of one.
Make it short, sir.

979
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,500
You are aware his widow
has been left a pauper.

980
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,800
<i>I do not know his widow.
Nor wish to.</i>

981
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,600
And what of his child?

982
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,900
Will you not wish to know that?

983
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:27,400
It's just another consequence
of George's disobedience and folly.

984
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,300
She would have me give you this.
If it's a message from that woman,
I do not wish to read it.

985
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,400
It is a message from your son, sir.

986
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,600
<i>She has carried it for you
from that day to this.</i>

987
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
<i>"Forgive me if you can.</i>

988
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,600
<i>"And try to remember
your loving and grateful son.</i>

989
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,100
<i>George. '"
Georgy!</i>

990
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,700
My boy!

991
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,900
My darling boy!

992
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,800
<i>- Isn't he an angel?
- An angel.</i>

993
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,800
<i>When George died I thought,</i>

994
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,500
I will never have room in my heart
for anyone else.

995
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,500
We weren't expecting you today.

996
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,500
I've come to tell you
I've put in for a transfer.

997
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,100
- I embark next week for Bombay.
- Bombay?

998
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,500
Heavens. Why Bombay?

999
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,100
<i>Because it is as far away
from here as I could manage.</i>

1000
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,200
I see.

1001
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,600
But I will resign my commission,
and I will stay in England...

1002
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,000
- if you ask me to.
- If I ask you to?

1003
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,800
<i>I will not go if you tell me not to.</i>

1004
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,400
You must seeJos
when you get there.

1005
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:34,400
I can write to you?
Tell you how Georgy is doing?

1006
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,400
William, l...

1007
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,100
l...

1008
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,400
The agents will forward any letters.

1009
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Well, good-bye.

1010
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,100
We'll meet again one day.

1011
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:07,800
<i>Good-bye.</i>

1012
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,000
This one here stays.

1013
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,900
Come, come, Rawdy.
This is your new home!

1014
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:37,400
Scullery, dining room,
boudoir.

1015
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,800
Oh!

1016
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,200
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of sad tidings, Colonel.

1017
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,000
<i>You know how I esteemed your aunt.
There was no suffering.</i>

1018
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,200
Mr. Pitt and LadyJane looked
after her tenderly until the end.

1019
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,700
I'll bet they did.

1020
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:23,400
Right. Let me know if there's
anything more I can do for you.

1021
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,400
<i>She cut me out.</i>

1022
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,400
Pitt has swept the pool.

1023
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,800
Oh, Becky,
it's you and Rawdy
I feel sorry for.

1024
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,800
Don't.
It'll come right. You'll see.

1025
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,200
I'm a governess, and you're a gambler.
We were never going to shoot into society.

1026
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,100
It'll take time.

1027
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,200
What will we eat in the meantime?

1028
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,500
Oh, my dear, let me manage that.

1029
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,800
We're Crawleys,
and Crawleys have credit.

1030
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,000
You'll be surprised to see how well
we can live on practically nothing a year.

1031
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:22,900
Excuse me, ma'am. Master Rawdy
has something to show you.

1032
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,000
What is it, Nurse?

1033
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:30,400
<i>Walking.!</i>

1034
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,200
<i>Walking.!</i>

1035
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,500
Well, if those aren't
the stoutest steps...

1036
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,000
<i>I've ever seen a young man take.</i>

1037
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:44,800
Why, you'll be marching
to the colors in no time, my boy.

1038
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,000
- Come!
- Yes!

1039
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,400
Ya-ha! Rawdy!

1040
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:04,300
How are you today, my boy? Huh?
Fine, sir.

1041
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:07,900
Good. Here we go.

1042
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:20,000
- Yes?
- Are you a soldier, sir?

1043
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,300
Yes, my boy. I am.

1044
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,600
My papa was a soldier, sir.
He fell at Waterloo.

1045
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,000
I'm sorry to hear that.
What was his name?

1046
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,900
Captain George Osborne,
sir, of the Ninth.

1047
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,300
Oh, but I knew him well.

1048
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,900
Stop!

1049
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,500
What's the matter with you?

1050
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,400
Nothing.

1051
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,300
Oh, for heaven's sake, Maria.
Out with it.

1052
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:28,000
It's just that I was driving in
the park the other day, and...

1053
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,200
<i>And?
And, and, and, and, and?</i>

1054
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:36,900
Father. I saw little George.

1055
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,300
<i>He was with Mr. Sedley,</i>

1056
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,500
<i>and I knew him at once.</i>

1057
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,100
He's as beautiful as an angel.

1058
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,100
And... And so like him.

1059
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,200
Dash it, Becky.

1060
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,400
Is this really the best we can manage?

1061
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,200
There's my desk. Here's the key.

1062
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:20,200
If you can find a spare penny piece
in it, I'll take my hat off to you.

1063
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,800
Unless you mean for once
to make a contribution.

1064
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,000
The whole animal
was made of scrag end!

1065
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,800
If only the butcher didn't want
to be paid. How can he be so selfish?

1066
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:40,600
<i>Don't be hard on me, old girl.</i>

1067
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:44,000
<i>I've had a run ofbad luck.</i>

1068
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,500
Things'll get better.

1069
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,800
<i>That Mr. Moss is here.
I've brought him up.</i>

1070
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:58,900
Take him back down again,
damn you. Until we've finished eating!

1071
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,400
- Rawdon, please.
- Needs must, Colonel.

1072
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,400
And I hope you've got
good news for me.

1073
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Moss,
but we're not magicians.

1074
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,600
We can't give you the money
if we haven't got it.

1075
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,300
Why not? You can spend it
when you haven't got it.

1076
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,500
Oh, you're wasted as a bailiff.
You should write for the stage.

1077
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,200
And you should go on it.
You're a good enough actress.

1078
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:20,500
That is enough! We cannot pay it,
and there it is. Now get out.

1079
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,200
All right, I'll go.
But I'll be back.

1080
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,500
Clear the way there!

1081
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,600
Get out of the way!

1082
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,700
Is this really your home then?

1083
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,900
Yes, it is.

1084
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
How is such a thing possible?
What do you want with me, sir?

1085
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,200
I have a proposal to put to you.

1086
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,100
Why do you do that, Mama?
It is so degrading.

1087
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,900
I do it so we can eat.
Hunger is degrading too.

1088
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,400
That is our food, Georgy!
It is not a toy!

1089
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,500
I hate our food.
And I have no toys.

1090
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,900
None that I want anyway.

1091
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,400
How can you be so cruel?

1092
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,400
Cruel?

1093
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,900
When he might have had
the finest education money could buy.

1094
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,100
When he could have been
as rich as a lord.

1095
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,600
<i>And his own mother
steals his future...</i>

1096
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,400
because she wants to
tuck him up in bed.

1097
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,900
"A mother's love is worth
more than palaces in Mayfair."

1098
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,900
Do you not remember
what Major Dobbin wrote?

1099
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,900
- Pray don't talk about Major Dobbin.
- Why not?

1100
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
What's the point,
now he's engaged?

1101
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,500
What?

1102
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,900
Oh, didn't you read Joseph's letter?

1103
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,000
<i>"How are you, my dear Amelia?</i>

1104
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,200
"And how is all your little family?

1105
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,900
"If you did but know how brightly
your image burns for me...

1106
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,100
<i>"and how I dream of you
and Georgy hand-in-hand.</i>

1107
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
<i>"Every detail of your daily life
is precious to me...</i>

1108
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:33,400
<i>as I sit and write
beneath the Indian sun. '"</i>

1109
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,500
<i>"Dear William.</i>

1110
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:43,200
<i>"Thank you for your letter which took
three months to reach me... Mother?</i>

1111
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,400
<i>But was very welcome when it did. '"</i>

1112
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,400
Mother, what are you doing here?
I was coming to see you on Saturday.

1113
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,900
<i>"Georgy is in good health...
I made Georgy some shirts.</i>

1114
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,300
<i>And living with his grandfather. '"
I was going to leave them for him.</i>

1115
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,200
Oh, Mother. I couldn't wear
your funny old shirts now.

1116
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,500
Good day to you, madam.
Come along, Georgy.

1117
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,500
You are silly, Mama.

1118
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,600
<i>- Silly old Mama!
- "I am persuaded it is better.</i>

1119
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,500
<i>So, for his sake, I must submit. '"</i>

1120
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:33,000
Listen, Dobbs, if you'd rather
leave it for some other time,
I can easily find someone else.

1121
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,100
No. No, no, I'm coming.

1122
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:39,900
<i>"I confess it was with quite a pang that I
read Joseph's news of your engagement. '"</i>

1123
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
What?

1124
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,800
Dobbs, I can't breathe!

1125
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,100
<i>Good Lord, Dobbs.
Have you lost your mind altogether?</i>

1126
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,500
It's time I returned to England.

1127
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,100
Here's your medicine, Sir Pitt.

1128
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:23,100
Take it away. There's no medicine
can cure what ails me.

1129
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:27,000
I'm dying, Horrocks.
This is the end.
Oh, come, Sir Pitt.

1130
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:31,200
Shall I fetch Mr. Pitt?
Or the doctor?

1131
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,200
Or the lawyer?

1132
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,300
That's the question, Horrocks.

1133
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,000
Pitt's had Tilly's money.

1134
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Shall he have mine too?

1135
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:49,900
Or should it go to Rawdon? Hmm?

1136
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,400
And foxy little Becky?

1137
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,600
I can fetch the lawyer
if you want me to, sir.

1138
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:59,700
Uh? Oh, no.

1139
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:05,000
No. Let Pitt have it all. Yeah.

1140
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,100
He's a pompous beggar,

1141
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:11,600
but he'll keep
this old place together.

1142
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,200
And your piano practice?
I hope you've not been neglecting it.

1143
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,600
No, Miss... I mean Mrs. Crawley.

1144
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,400
I'm glad to hear it.
You must play for me.

1145
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,600
And, Rose,
what is your best subject?
French.

1146
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:43,700
No airs. No bid to bury
her governess's past.

1147
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,700
You cannot dislike her for that, surely?

1148
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,200
No. I agree.
Not for that.

1149
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,200
Uh, Rawdon, after luncheon,

1150
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,500
perhaps you'd like to see my pamphlet
on the emancipation issue?
Oh, God, help me.

1151
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,700
Uh, Mrs., uh, Crawley,

1152
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:04,100
when you told Miss Crawley
that your mother
was a Montmorency...

1153
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:09,000
I never said that. I spoke once
of the Montmorencys, but that's all.

1154
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:12,100
She must have misunderstood me.
My mother sang opera.

1155
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,700
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

1156
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,200
What shall we do after luncheon?

1157
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,800
<i>Well, we are in mourning.
Uh, uh, yes.</i>

1158
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,900
Y-You are right to say so,

1159
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:30,100
but I don't think my father's death
should banish all social converse.

1160
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:34,800
Then what I should like to do best
would be to play something
with our little boys.

1161
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,900
Little Pitt has not been well.

1162
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:45,200
W-Well, I gave Little Pitt
some tonic before lunch.

1163
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,600
- I remember how your medicines
helped poor Miss Crawley.
- Mm.

1164
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,600
<i>Well...</i>

1165
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,600
L... We...

1166
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,900
We're all, uh, family here,
so l-I feel we may speak openly.

1167
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,700
<i>L- I hope, um, Aunt Matilda's
final disposition...</i>

1168
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,200
h-h-has not...

1169
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,100
Miss Crawley gave me the most
wonderful husband in the world.

1170
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,900
How could I be angry with her?

1171
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,700
I'm glad her fortune will restore
the glory of this place and this family,

1172
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,900
of which I'm proud to be a member.

1173
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,100
Ohh.

1174
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,900
It is we Crawleys, madam,
who are the gainers by your marriage.

1175
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:29,100
- Thank you.
- Mm.

1176
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,000
Bye, Rawdy!

1177
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,900
<i>Bye, Auntie Becky.!</i>

1178
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:40,100
<i>Bye, Uncle Rawdon.! Bye.!</i>

1179
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,800
I like AuntJane.
Don't you, Papa?

1180
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:48,700
I do. Pitt's lucky there.
She's kind and good.

1181
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,000
I could be good on 5,000 a year.

1182
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,100
Oh, do you not care for her, then?

1183
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:58,100
What does that matter?
Don't you see what this means?

1184
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:02,800
We're back in the family.
At long last we've begun.

1185
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:09,300
<i>Careful of that table now.
That's valuable, that is.</i>

1186
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:18,800
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1187
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,400
I told you I'd be back, lady.
Here, look, you'd better wrap up
that cooker glass.

1188
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,000
No! How dare you try and bring out
my things on the street!
Here, let me have that!

1189
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,700
I'll call the constable!
You can call the King for all I care!

1190
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,800
Give it back to me!
I'm takin' it!
You're not having this!

1191
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:34,700
Give it to me!
I wonder if I might be of some help.

1192
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,500
A pleasure doing business.

1193
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,600
Just go.

1194
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,300
We meet at last.

1195
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:04,700
I know you, Lord Steyne,
you do not know me.

1196
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:09,000
You will have forgotten, but you were
kind to my father once, many years ago.

1197
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,500
I am seldom praised for...
for being kind.
What was his name?

1198
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,400
Francis Sharp.

1199
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,500
You are Francis Sharp's daughter?

1200
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,200
He had a great talent
for painting, as I recall,

1201
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,400
and none at all for life.

1202
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:34,100
I'm attempting to redress that balance.
It is my challenge.

1203
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:43,400
I've watched you in the lists.
I wish you luck.

1204
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,600
<i>It will not be easy.</i>

1205
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,900
Of course, it's the women
who keep the doors of society closed.

1206
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,400
They do not like outsiders to discover
that there's nothing behind them.

1207
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,800
Should you like to come
to Gaunt House?

1208
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,900
Very much, my lord.

1209
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,700
You will be bored there.

1210
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,800
My wife is as gay as Lady Macbeth...

1211
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:10,800
and my daughters-in-law
as cheerful as Goneril and Regan.

1212
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:14,300
They will bully you and snub you
and patronize you.

1213
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,100
But that's what you want, I suppose.

1214
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,400
It is.

1215
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:29,200
You should take this.

1216
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,500
You don't want him
back tomorrow.

1217
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,200
You're playing with fire, Becky.
Dearest, be reasonable.

1218
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:07,300
You can pander all you like
to the great and the good.

1219
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:11,300
We're not their type,
never will be.
Of course we are.

1220
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:15,500
You have the best blood in England
in your veins if only you'd use it.

1221
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,900
You know,
Lord Steyne's planning a dinner
next week with the Minister of War.

1222
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,100
He promises to talk
of nothing but you.

1223
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,700
The cards are in your hand, darling.

1224
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,800
Must I show you how to play them?

1225
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,800
So now you are to instruct me
in games of chance?

1226
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,000
I just want you to think
on the winnings.

1227
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:39,300
Oh, I know what we have to win.
I'm just afraid of what we might lose.

1228
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:49,200
You're taking favors
from a tiger, Becky.

1229
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,200
I'm not afraid.

1230
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,100
Keep your eyes open.

1231
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,400
♪ Come with me ♪

1232
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:15,100
♪ And we will go ♪

1233
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:26,800
Must I repeat myself?
You will write a card to
Colonel and Mrs. Crawley.

1234
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,100
But Blanche writes them.

1235
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,800
Not this time, I don't.

1236
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,000
Lady Steyne, I cannot believe...

1237
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:43,300
that I am compelled
to issue a request three times.

1238
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,500
I will write it.

1239
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,200
Then I will not be present.
I will go home.

1240
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:00,300
Good! Stay there!

1241
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,700
<i>Let me be free of
your damned tragedy airs.!</i>

1242
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,300
<i>Who are you to give orders?</i>

1243
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:10,300
You're here to have children
and you're barren!

1244
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:14,100
<i>My son is sick of you.!
There's no one in the house
that doesn't wish you dead.!</i>

1245
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,500
Besides, what's the matter
with Mrs. Crawley?

1246
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,500
<i>She's not well born, it's true,</i>

1247
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:33,000
but she's no worse than
Fanny's illustrious ancestor,
the first de la Jones.

1248
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,500
- The money I brought to this family, sir...
- Purchased my second son as a husband...

1249
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:41,200
<i>whom the whole world
knows is mad.</i>

1250
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,300
Enough.

1251
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,100
This is my house.

1252
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,100
If I invite the trash from every prison
and brothel in London,

1253
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,600
you will receive them
and you'll make them welcome.

1254
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:23,400
Remember. You have no friends
beyond this door.

1255
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,600
<i>Lady Bareacres, what did you
make of the new Figaro?
I thought it was quite interesting.</i>

1256
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,800
I hear you sing
and play beautifully,
Mrs. Crawley.

1257
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,100
I wish you'd sing for me.
It would be my pleasure.

1258
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:33,900
What are you doing?
I've seen enough cruelty
in this house to want to inflict it.

1259
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:44,200
"Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal."

<i>Bravo. Bravo.</i>

1279
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,300
You are through the door.

1280
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,500
That boy of yours,
when does he go away to school?

1281
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,500
Oh, when he's older, I suppose.

1282
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:54,400
No, no. He must learn to stand
on his own two feet at once.

1283
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,800
Miss that lesson in childhood
and you'll miss it all your life.

1284
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,800
Well, I'm not sure Rawdon
could spare him yet.
And he's very spirited.

1285
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,300
I shall arrange it.

1286
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,500
No need to thank me.

1287
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:12,800
Perhaps then we could
see a little more of each other.

1288
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:17,300
Aren't you forgetting my husband?

1289
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,900
I never forget anything,
Mrs. Crawley.

1290
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,300
Least of all an unpaid debt.

1291
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,200
<i>She hasn't been at all well, has she?</i>

1292
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:43,400
Must I go?
Must I really?

1293
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:47,000
Can't I stay
if I promise to be good?

1294
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,900
It won't be for long, old chap.
Yes, it will.

1295
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,000
Come here.

1296
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:06,100
It's time, darling.

1297
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,800
Bye.

1298
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,900
<i>Tonight, Lord Steyne will unveil
his mystery performance...</i>

1299
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
<i>directed by himself
and performed by the Duchess of Lancaster,</i>

1300
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,700
<i>the Countess of Slingstone
and other great ladies
ofhis lordship's acquaintance.</i>

1301
01:52:56,100 --> 01:53:01,600
<i>Your Majesty, my lords,
ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.</i>

1302
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:05,100
The entertainment is about to begin.

1303
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:09,900
What has Steyne got planned,
Lady Steyne?
I wish I knew.

1304
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,800
<i>Extraordinary.</i>

1305
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,900
<i>- Steyne the Pasha and his nautch girls.
- I give you the ballet Zirnana.</i>

1306
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:56,300
It's Mrs. Crawley.

1307
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:56,900
<i>Well done, all.</i>

1308
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,400
<i>Bravo.! Bravo.!</i>

1309
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,500
<i>Extraordinary.</i>

1310
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,100
<i>- Yes.
- Bravo.!</i>

1311
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:13,200
Ah, Mrs. Crawley.

1312
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:15,400
To the victor the spoils.

1313
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:18,600
You have carried off
our hearts in triumph.

1314
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:20,700
If that is so, Your Majesty,

1315
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:23,900
then you may rest easy
that your heart will be
well looked after.

1316
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:30,500
That is a relief, for it has been
bruised in its time.

1317
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,600
You must tell me at dinner
how you mean to treat it.

1318
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,500
You will sit next to me.

1319
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:39,100
Precedence would make that
a little difficult, sir.

1320
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:43,000
<i>I am the King, Lady Gaunt.
I confer precedence.</i>

1321
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,600
Well, are you happy?

1322
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:55,200
I said that I would make you
queen of the night and I have.

1323
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:58,700
<i>I'm certainly grateful, my lord.
But not happy?</i>

1324
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,300
Well, which of us is happy?

1325
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:06,100
Not you? Surely you take
pleasure in your pictures.
Yes.

1326
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:10,000
I can hide behind them.
You, my lord, hide from what?

1327
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:13,000
From the simple truth that is known
to every shepherd and footman...

1328
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:17,200
<i>that the only thing of value
in this life is to love...</i>

1329
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,000
and be loved.

1330
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:24,700
I've hidden from it because
I didn't think that I would ever find it.

1331
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:28,200
Now I believe I have.

1332
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,700
You jest with me, my lord.

1333
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:37,200
I make a poor companion with
the splendors that surround you.

1334
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:43,800
The chief advantage
of being born into society...

1335
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:48,700
is that one learns early
what a tawdry puppet play it is.

1336
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:04,500
<i>You remember the child
who set a high price on this picture...</i>

1337
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,100
before she could bear to see it go?

1338
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,300
Not high enough.

1339
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,900
The trouble is, Mrs. Crawley,
you've taken the goods.

1340
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,400
It's too late to query the price.

1341
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:31,700
Colonel Crawley.

1342
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,700
May I walk with you?

1343
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,300
By all means, Wenham.

1344
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:40,200
Good evening, Colonel.
Oh, Lord!

1345
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:45,000
It's a small thing, Colonel.
£165 you owe Mr. Nathan.

1346
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:48,200
<i>For God's sake, Wenham, lend me 100.
I have 70 at home.</i>

1347
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:53,200
I'm sorry. I don't have £10
in the whole world,
my dear fellow.

1348
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,600
Don't worry.
Mr. Moss will take good care
of you, won't you, Mr. Moss?

1349
01:57:56,600 --> 01:58:00,200
I run the most comfortable
debtor's prison in London.
Come on.

1350
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,900
Unhand me!

1351
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,600
Good night.

1352
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:32,100
You sure I can't get
you anything, Colonel?

1353
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,100
My wife will be here
at any moment.

1354
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:38,000
If you say so, sir.
Ring the bell when you
want something.

1355
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:42,200
- You did deliver my letter, yes?
- I delivered it myself, sir.

1356
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:44,400
Is there no one else
I might call on?

1357
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:47,000
My brother, I suppose.

1358
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,900
But I hardly like to trouble him
when I know that Becky will be
on her way before too long.

1359
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:53,600
Even so, sir.

1360
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,500
Poor Rawdon. He's in prison.

1361
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:19,800
I know.
I'll send my man Wenham
with the bail tomorrow.

1362
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,700
One night won't kill him.

1363
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,700
Heaven knows
he's on familiar territory.

1364
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:37,600
Oh, Becky. Thank God.

1365
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
It is I, Rawdon. It's Jane.

1366
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
<i>When your note came, I read it.</i>

1367
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:47,300
I've paid Mr. Moss.

1368
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,700
This is no place for a woman like you.

1369
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:57,100
<i>You should not have come here.
I'm not worth it.</i>

1370
01:59:57,100 --> 02:00:01,100
Yes, you are.
You are worth it.

1371
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:03,200
I want to change, Jane.

1372
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:08,000
I mean to make a different life
for Rawdy and I.

1373
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,400
At least I mean to try.
Then you will succeed.

1374
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:17,700
Now, get your things
and I'll take you home.

1375
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,900
I must apologize...

1376
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,500
for my excessive zeal.

1377
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,200
You need no forgiveness from me.

1378
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:51,000
Oh, but I do.
I need your forgiveness.

1379
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,100
And your love.

1380
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,900
Suppose my wish is to finish now,
if I ask no other favor?

1381
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,800
You've had your wishes,
Mrs. Crawley.

1382
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,200
<i>Crawley. What kept you?</i>

1383
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:12,200
Nothing happened, Rawdon.
I beg you to believe me.
I'm innocent.

1384
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:15,300
<i>What are you two scheming about?
Tell him I'm innocent.</i>

1385
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:19,600
You, innocent?
When my money has bought
every trinket on your body?

1386
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:24,500
Let me pass, sir.
You cowardly, villainous liar!

1387
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:36,400
Rawdon! Rawdon, don't!
What are you doing?

1388
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:41,100
Come here!

1389
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,600
Take off that necklace.

1390
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,100
Now get out!

1391
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:05,900
Open it! Open it.

1392
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,600
I want to know
if you or he are lying.
Open it!

1393
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:26,500
A thousand pounds.

1394
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:32,800
You might have spared me
a hundred, Becky.

1395
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,400
I always shared with you.

1396
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:57,200
Rawdon! Rawdon, wait!

1397
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:00,900
<i>Please.! Forgive me.</i>

1398
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,700
Wait! Wait!

1399
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:09,200
I made a grave mistake.
I'm sorry.

1400
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,600
You cannot know
the journey that I have made.

1401
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:14,700
Oh, I should.
I traveled with you.

1402
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,400
Not from the beginning.

1403
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,600
Please, Rawdon.

1404
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:24,400
In my way, I've loved you.

1405
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:28,200
Then that is your misfortune.
Good-bye, Rebecca.

1406
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:59,300
<i>"Following the premature death
of His Excellency,
the Governor of Coventry Island,</i>

1407
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:04,200
"we hear the post is to be offered to
the distinguished veteran of Waterloo,

1408
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:06,300
Colonel Rawdon Crawley."

1409
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,400
Well, this is excellent.

1410
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:11,800
Excellent be damned!

1411
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:16,500
The place is a graveyard,
and it is Steyne who sends me to it.

1412
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,600
Well, whatever the reason,

1413
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:23,600
this is a chance
and you must take it.

1414
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:30,500
<i>Good boy. Steady now.</i>

1415
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,800
My life has not been much.

1416
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:41,600
Everything I've touched
has turned to dust,

1417
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:44,100
except that boy.

1418
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:49,400
Would you take care of him for me?

1419
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,500
Rawdon, I promise you
I will love him as my own.

1420
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,700
I do already.

1421
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,000
God bless you.

1422
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:08,100
Brother.

1423
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:33,100
Him.

1424
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,600
Who? Who said that?

1425
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,200
Of course.

1426
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:57,600
<i>Madame de Crawley.</i>

1427
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:00,200
Off to work.

1428
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:14,900
Place your bets.

1429
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:27,000
I'm sorry, I don't speak...
Is this your first time in the casino?

1430
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:31,900
And if it is?
You must use
your beginner's luck wisely.

1431
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:35,000
<i>The chance will not come again.</i>

1432
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:47,100
George. What would Amelia say
if she knew you were here?

1433
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:50,000
Not now, Dobbin.
May I present...

1434
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:52,600
But I know the major very well.

1435
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,600
Mrs. Crawley.

1436
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:58,500
Don't tell me it is
the infamous Mrs. Crawley.
George.

1437
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:05,700
It is, sir. So your mother must
be traveling on the continent.

1438
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,700
Your grandfather
forgave her in the end?

1439
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:12,500
He did, God bless him.
He left her well provided for.

1440
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,600
We've been traveling
with my mother's friend.

1441
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:18,800
Alas, Major Dobbin,
are you still only her friend?

1442
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,100
Come.

1443
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,900
You must see Mama.
Come tomorrow.

1444
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,900
<i>We're at the Erbprinz Hotel.</i>

1445
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,800
She won't want to be disturbed.

1446
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,000
Major Dobbin, I don't
remember you for a tease.

1447
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:36,800
I would love to.
Tell her I'll be there
in the morning.

1448
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,600
You must have known my father.

1449
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:42,700
Do you think I'm like him?

1450
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:47,200
Very.

1451
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:51,200
It is not your place
to issue invitations.
But if she's an old friend...

1452
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:55,600
She's an old acquaintance.
It's not the same.
Your mother won't wish to see her.

1453
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:01,700
Of course I want to see her.

1454
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:04,000
Becky. How could I not?

1455
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
That little devil brings mischief
wherever she goes.
She killed her husband.

1456
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:11,700
He died of tropical fever.

1457
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:15,000
You can hardly lay that at her door.
Can't I?

1458
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:18,600
They took her son from her.

1459
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:24,500
Rubbish.
Rawdon took the boy away
because cats are better mothers.

1460
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:27,800
And what do you know of motherhood?
You have no child.

1461
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:30,000
Don't I know it?

1462
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,400
And if I have any authority
in this house...

1463
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:35,500
Authority?

1464
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:38,300
<i>You have none, sir.</i>

1465
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:41,600
Who do you think you are?
My father?

1466
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:44,700
<i>My husband?</i>

1467
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:48,800
You're right.

1468
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:52,100
<i>I know what your heart
is capable of.</i>

1469
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:56,700
<i>It can cling faithfully
to a misty memory
and cherish a dream,</i>

1470
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:04,300
but it cannot recognize
or return a love like mine.

1471
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:09,500
- L-I have been your friend.
- No.

1472
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:14,700
You have allowed me
to be your friend.

1473
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
<i>We have spent enough of our lives
at this play, Amelia.</i>

1474
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,100
Let this end.

1475
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,500
We are both weary of it.

1476
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:50,800
When his cousin died, I knew
Rawdy would spend his life
at Queen's Crawley.

1477
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:54,400
He belongs there.

1478
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,700
But you must see him.

1479
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:59,300
Why don't you?
Does LadyJane prevent it?

1480
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:02,900
No. Jane would not
keep me from him.

1481
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,800
But Rawdy has
become a great man.

1482
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:13,300
I love him and I wish him well,
but my place is no longer with him.

1483
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,300
Tell me, how is Major Dobbin?

1484
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:20,200
I passed him as I came here,
looking very fierce.

1485
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:27,600
We have fallen out.
Over me?

1486
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:31,900
Over you, yes,
but over other things as well.

1487
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,400
Amelia Osborne, you're a damn fool.

1488
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:37,300
<i>He is your dearest friend.</i>

1489
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:40,200
It matters not what he thinks of me.
You should go and fetch him.

1490
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:44,700
<i>I cannot, Rebecca.
You don't know what lies between us.
I do.</i>

1491
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:48,400
Ever since I saw him buy that piano,
I've known how it stood between you.

1492
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,200
<i>That was George.
It was Dobbin.</i>

1493
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:55,300
- I saw him with my own eyes.
- George loved me.

1494
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:58,400
George Osborne loved
no one but himself.

1495
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:01,000
He'd have jilted you but for Dobbin
and left you if he'd lived.

1496
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:04,600
Stop! Silence.

1497
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,600
Dobbin was right.

1498
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:13,900
Wherever you go, you trail wickedness
and heartache in your wake.

1499
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,100
I came prepared for this.
George gave this to me at
the Duchess of Richmond's Ball.

1500
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,900
Whatever it is, I will not read it.

1501
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,800
"My darling, Becky, won't you save me
from a life of dreary toil?

1502
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:31,100
<i>Fly with me.
We will dance our way
across Europe. Your George. '"</i>

1503
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,800
That is the man you have
made your life a shrine to.

1504
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,700
I've been a fool.

1505
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:46,100
We have all been fools.

1506
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:52,300
<i>But you may still
remedy your folly. Go.!</i>

1507
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:03,200
<i>Hurry.
In the back.</i>

1508
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,900
Wait! Wait!

1509
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:27,400
<i>My Angel, take compassion upon us.</i>

1510
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:31,200
<i>Dine with Fritz and me at the inn
in the park. We'll die if you don't.</i>

1511
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:35,500
Tomorrow maybe.
Ask me again tomorrow.

1512
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:39,000
Today I'm a little tired.

1513
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:01,700
<i>I'm looking for a Madame de Crawley.</i>

1514
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:04,300
<i>Can you tell me
where I might find her?</i>

1515
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Mr. Sedley?

1516
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,600
Mr. Joseph Sedley?

1517
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:19,600
What are you doing in Germany?

1518
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:24,300
ByJove.
Have I found you?

1519
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:27,900
Amelia said you were here.

1520
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:34,400
Is it truly the beautiful Mrs. Crawley?

1521
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:43,400
I'm on my way back to India.

1522
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:46,000
India.

1523
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,600
<i>My gad, Mrs. Crawley.
What a turn up.</i>

1524
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:56,300
I do hope that traveling
will not tire you.
Oh, no, Mr. Sedley.

1525
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:00,000
You know I love to visit new places.

1526
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,300
It's so beautiful.
