3
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,693
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, mate.

4
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,195
Don't worry about it.

5
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,821
You all right?

6
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,200
Enjoy LA.

7
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,644
-He did it.
-It's all right.

8
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,226
Can you tell me why everything
is always about you?

9
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,770
Everything is not always about me.

10
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,272
That gearhead with his pocket protector
was being sarcastic.

11
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,815
-You damn well know it.
-"Sarcastic."

12
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,984
-I'm sorry, I just didn't see it that way.
-Oh, that's bullshit.

13
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,153
What about the dig about the makeover?
That was really nice.

14
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,655
What do you want me to do?
I work with the man.

15
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,575
You're perfectly capable
of taking care of your own shit.

16
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,162
You know something? The last time
I checked, you were sleeping with me.

17
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,374
So unless you want to start
fucking him, I suggest...

18
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,433
Pal, where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

19
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,643
-Back there.
-Thanks.

20
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,907
It was him in that gold Lexus
on the cell phone.

21
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,746
Are they still asking
for a change of venue?

22
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,709
He's enhanceable because of priors
in the early '80s.

23
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,340
-Where to?
-Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.

24
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,925
Downtown.

25
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,600
Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7:00 a.m., period. Okay?

26
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,229
Hold on.
Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea.

27
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,107
Take La Brea north to 6th into downtown.

28
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,319
So what? You'll be up late.

29
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,446
I'm pulling an all-nighter, too,
so save the tears.

30
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,865
I'll take the 105 east to the 110.
That's faster.

31
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,074
What?

32
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,869
I said, the 105 to the 110,
that'|| get you there quicker.

33
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,330
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

34
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,626
But once you get to La Brea north
of Santa Monica, then it's jammed.

35
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,002
The 110 north of the 10,

36
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,130
you get people driving to Pasadena,
and they drive slow.

37
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,842
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand, and then I...

38
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,264
Hey, surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

39
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,146
-Are we taking bets?
-Are we?

40
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,856
But what if you're wrong?

41
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,319
I don't think I'm gonna be wrong,
but if I am, the ride's free.

42
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,200
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

43
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,351
Go ahead, say it.

44
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,644
-Say what?
-Go ahead.

45
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,147
-I got lucky with the lights.
-You weren't lucky with the lights.

46
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,817
What you were was right. I was wrong.

47
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,445
Max.

48
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,415
You mind turning that up?

49
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,292
You like the classics.

50
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,044
I do. I used to play in high school.

51
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,422
-Let me guess. Woodwinds.
-No. Strings.

52
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,299
I never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

53
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,760
Could've fooled me by the way
you were unloading on that cell phone.

54
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,721
Different instrument.

55
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,809
If you had just listened to me, we'd be
all bogged down in traffic right now.

56
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,894
You would've made yourself
an extra five bucks.

57
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,773
Well, you keep that five bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

58
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,653
Really, it's not that... It's not
a big deal. Nothing big here.

59
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,572
Well, how many cabbies do you know

60
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,574
get you into an argument
to save you money?

61
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,952
There were two of us. I had to kill
the other one. I don't like competition.

62
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,126
Take pride in being good at what you do?

63
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,753
What, this?

64
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,172
This is-- No, this is part-time.

65
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,841
This is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.

66
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,803
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

67
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,268
-What else?
-Just shaping up some things.

68
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,479
Like?

69
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,398
Tell me.

70
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,276
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

71
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,030
It's gonna be like an island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

72
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,492
When you get to the airport,
you're not gonna wanna get out of my limo.

73
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,620
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases,

74
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,165
staff up, get the right client list,
you know, things like that.

75
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,670
How do you like being a lawyer?

76
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,174
-What are you, psychic?
-Little bit.

77
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,134
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

78
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,387
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

79
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,515
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

80
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,267
And the purse. A Bottega.

81
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:41,814
Anyway, a man gets in my cab
with a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

82
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,483
<i>You'?</i>

83
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,361
Clarence Darrow.

84
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,238
Well, no, not quite.

85
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,448
He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.

86
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,283
-Big case?
-Yeah.

87
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,662
-Got us here fast.
-Of course.

88
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,998
But you didn't answer my question.

89
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,460
Do you like what you do?

90
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,296
Yeah.

91
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,092
But not today.

92
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,054
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

93
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,100
I love standing in that courtroom.

94
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,437
At the same time,
I get this clenched-up thing

95
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,063
the night before the first days.

96
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,734
Clenched up? How?

97
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,000
I think I'm gonna lose,
I think the case sucks,

98
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,836
my exhibits aren't in order,
I'm not prepared enough,

99
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,047
people are gonna find out
that I don't know what I'm doing

100
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,800
and I've been running some charade
all these years.

101
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,927
I represent the Department of Justice,

102
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,180
and my opening statement is gonna
fall flat at the most important point,

103
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,807
and the jury's gonna laugh at me.

104
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,064
And then I cry. I don't throw up.

105
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,484
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

106
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,111
And then I pull myself together,

107
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,865
I rewrite my opening statement,
work my exhibits,

108
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,201
and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

109
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,036
That's my routine.

110
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,292
In the morning, it starts, and I'm fine.

111
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,128
You need a vacation.

112
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,631
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

113
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,425
Not in a cab.
You need to get your head straight.

114
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,054
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic, you know--

115
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,806
When was the last time you took a break?

116
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,683
-I go on a vacation all the time.
-How often?

117
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,726
A dozen times a day.

118
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,645
My favorite spot.

119
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,606
Maldives Island.

120
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,236
It's my own private getaway.

121
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,322
Things get heavy for me,
I take five minutes out,

122
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,283
and I just go there.

123
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,536
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

124
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,170
-Here. Take it.
-No. I couldn't do that.

125
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,340
Take it. Because you need it
a lot more than I do.

126
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,885
And it'll help you. I guarantee it.

127
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,525
Thanks, Max.

128
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,819
Go get 'em.

129
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,725
H9)'-

130
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,233
I don't know.

131
00:12:55,317 --> 00:13:00,739
In case you ever wanna investigate
a Fortune 500 company or...

132
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,868
argue cab routes.

133
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,019
H9)'-

134
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,067
Hey, yeah. Come on, man, I'm sorry.

135
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,821
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.
I'll take you.

136
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,580
-Where to?
-1039 South Union Street.

137
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,749
Gotcha.

138
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,975
-How long you think this'|| take?
-Seven minutes.

139
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,270
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

140
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,023
Two minutes to get across
the 110 to Normandie.

141
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,608
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

142
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,277
Over to Union is one.
Plus one for "shit happens."

143
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,279
-Okay if I time you?
-Knock yourself out.

144
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,114
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

145
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,992
You get an apology.
I already offered my free ride today.

146
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,786
-To who?
-Some girl.

147
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,289
Did you get a date with her?

148
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,502
-First time in LA?
-No.

149
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,463
Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here,
I can't wait to leave.

150
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,217
Too sprawled out, disconnected. You know.

151
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,303
-That's me. You like it?
-It's my home.

152
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,596
Seventeen million people.

153
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,848
This was a country, it'd be
the fifth biggest economy in the world,

154
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,101
and nobody knows each other.

155
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,562
I read about this guy,
gets on the MTA here, dies.

156
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,524
Six hours he's riding the subway

157
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,568
before anybody notices his corpse
doing laps around LA.

158
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,737
People on and off sitting next to him.

159
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,240
Nobody notices.

160
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,872
This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

161
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,835
-Regular ride?
-Yeah. I share it with the day-shift guy.

162
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,587
-Because you prefer nights?
-Yeah. People are more relaxed.

163
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,881
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

164
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,051
-How are the benefits?
-It's not that kind of job.

165
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,888
I'm not in this for the long haul.
I'm just filling in, you know.

166
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,349
Just temporary while I'm getting
some things shaped up.

167
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,851
This is just temporary.

168
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,978
-How long you been driving?
-Twelve years.

169
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,105
Really?

170
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,483
What other things you putting together?

171
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,576
I don't wanna talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

172
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,871
-No offense. I just...
-None taken.

173
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,374
You're one of these guys
that do instead of talk.

174
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,501
That's cool.

175
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:53,138
-Seven minutes. Man, you're good.
-I got lucky with the lights.

176
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,141
Yeah, sure. You probably know
the light schedules, too.

177
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,396
Listen, I'm in town on a real-estate deal.
Close in one night.

178
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,733
I got five stops to make.
Collect signatures, see some friends.

179
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,445
And then I got a 6:00 a.m. out of LAX.
Why don't you hang with me?

180
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,655
The car's not for hire, man.
That's against regs.

181
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,324
-Regulations?
-Yeah.

182
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,119
These guys don't pay you sick leave.
How much you pull down a shift?

183
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,747
-How much?
-350, 400.

184
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,375
Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.
I'll make it 600.

185
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,921
Man, I don't know.

186
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,506
Plus an extra hundred, you get me to LAX
and I don't have to run for the plane.

187
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,508
I don't know about this.

188
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,968
-I don't know.
-Yeah, you do.

189
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,179
-I don't know, man.
-Yeah, you do.

190
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,765
-Six hundred...
-Cool. We got a deal.

191
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,975
Here's 300 down. What's your name?

192
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,936
-Max.
-Max.

193
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:42,979
-I'm Vincent.
-All right.

194
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,361
I can't stay double-parked here, though.

195
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,946
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building.

196
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,030
All right.

197
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,882
Definitely not from around here.

198
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,987
There you go.

199
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,862
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

200
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,076
What the--

201
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,829
What the hell? Damn it!

202
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,540
My man, you all right?

203
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,959
Shit. Fuck.

204
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,550
He fell on the cab.

205
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,596
He fell from up there
on the motherfucking cab.

206
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,058
-Shit. I think he's dead.
-Good guess.

207
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,275
You killed him?

208
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,820
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

209
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,283
Oh, man. Fuck this, man.

210
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,910
-Red light, Max.
-Hold on. Hold on.

211
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,497
Put your hands down.

212
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,874
-Put your hands down.
-Okay. Okay.

213
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,797
Okay, help me out. Pop the trunk.

214
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,841
-What?
-Pop the trunk.

215
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,137
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.

216
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,140
-What you doing?
-I'm gonna roll him off the roof.

217
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,684
Can't leave him here.
So unless you want him up front with you.

218
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,144
But given the hygiene...

219
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,438
-Shit.
-Okay.

220
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,107
It's only a dead guy.

221
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,901
Grab his hands.

222
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,487
-I can't do this.
-Grab his wrists.

223
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,661
-You got it?
-Yeah. He's twitching and shit.

224
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,958
Fuck.

225
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,389
Okay. That's good enough.

226
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,896
-Let's go.
-Hey, why don't you just take the cab?

227
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,898
-Take the cab?
-Yeah, you take it.

228
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,776
I'll chill. I'll just chill.

229
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,154
They don't even know who's driving
these things half the time anyway.

230
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,698
They never check or anything.
Okay? So just take it.

231
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,324
You, me...

232
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,911
-You promise not to tell anybody, right?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,456
Promise.

234
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,291
Get in the fucking car.

235
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,002
Get in the car.

236
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,788
Ramone.

237
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,879
Ramone.

238
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,853
<i>Ramona!</i>

239
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,200
<i>Ramona!</i>

240
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,975
Fuck.

241
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,403
<i>Rampart watch commander.</i>

242
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,238
This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

243
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:11,909
Send two black-and-whites and
a night detective to 1039 South Union.

244
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,162
And contact SID. I got a crime scene.

245
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,997
<i>Roger. 1039 South Union.</i>

246
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,012
-What are you doing?
-I got to clean it up. It's a mess.

247
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,557
So? Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here,
and the light's green.

248
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,225
Leave the seats.

249
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,106
Asshole!

250
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,778
You no longer have
the cleanest cab in la-la land.

251
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,323
You gotta live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

252
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,204
7565 Fountain. You know it?

253
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,247
-West Hollywood.
-How long you figure?

254
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,208
I don't know, man, 17 minutes.

255
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,628
Why?

256
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,381
No, no, no. Hold on, man.

257
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,093
-I told you we had other stops to make.
-You said you had to visit some friends.

258
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,136
-Well, they're somebody's friends.
-No.

259
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,139
You drive a cab, I make my rounds...

260
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,227
you might make it through the night,
come out 700 bucks ahead.

261
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,604
I'm not trying to piss you off,
but I can't do this.

262
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,065
I can't drive you around
while you go around killing people.

263
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,150
-It ain't my job.
-Tonight it is.

264
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,780
Look, you don't get it.
I mean it. I mean it.

265
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,075
I'm not up for this.

266
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,452
-Okay, you're stressed.
-Yes, I am.

267
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,746
You're stressed. I understand that.

268
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,333
Now, you just keep breathing
and stay calm.

269
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,252
-Are you breathing?
-Shit.

270
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,420
-Are you breathing?
-Yes.

271
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,963
Okay, good.

272
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,344
Okay, look, here's the deal.

273
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,097
You were gonna drive me around tonight
and never be the wiser,

274
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,726
but e/gordo got in front of a window,
did his high dive.

275
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,229
We're into plan B. You still breathing?

276
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:07,191
We gotta make the best of it.
improvise. Adapt to the environment.

277
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:10,987
Darwin. Shit happens. lCh/ng.
Whatever, man. We gotta roll with it.

278
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,781
LCh/ng. What are you talking about, man?
You threw a man out of a window.

279
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,200
I didn't throw him. He fell.

280
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,745
Well, what did he do to you?

281
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,081
-What?
-What did he do to you?

282
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,083
Nothing. I only met him tonight.

283
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,294
You just met him once,
and you kill him like that?

284
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,380
What, I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

285
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,631
No, man.

286
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,884
Max, six billion people on the planet,

287
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,927
you're getting bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

288
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,389
-Well, who was he?
-What do you care?

289
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,933
-Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
-Yes, I know Rwanda.

290
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,311
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.

291
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,564
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

292
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,232
-Did you bat an eye, Max?
-What?

293
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,068
Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam,

294
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:54,155
Save the Whales,
Greenpeace or something? No.

295
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,074
I off one fat Angeleno,
and you throw a hissy fit.

296
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,826
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.

297
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,162
You don't know the guy
in the trunk either.

298
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,538
Man.

299
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,709
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
he was a criminal

300
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,086
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

301
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,672
What are you doing,
just taking out the garbage?

302
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,424
Yeah. Something like that.

303
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,802
- <i>Pull over I0 the right.
-Shit.</i>

304
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,681
-Get rid of them.
-How?

305
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,684
You're a cabbie.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

306
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,066
Just, please, man, don't do anything.

307
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,236
Then don't let me get cornered.
You don't have the trunk space.

308
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,238
-I can't believe this.
-Believe it.

309
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,989
Don't. I'll talk to them.

310
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,328
He's probably married.

311
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,541
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

312
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,920
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I got it.
I'll deal with it. Yeah. Just a second.

313
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,298
-How you doing?
-Hey.

314
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,425
My partner's gonna help you out
on that side over there.

315
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,094
License, registration.

316
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,263
Yeah.

317
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,936
I'm pulling you over
because your Windshields smashed.

318
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,023
-All this current?
-Yes, Officer.

319
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,944
Hey, man, what'd you do,
have a food fight in here?

320
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,447
Yeah, |'||-- Pretty messy.
Just clean it up.

321
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,827
Hey, is this blood up here
on your windshield?

322
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,246
Yeah.

323
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,708
Yeah, I hit a deer.

324
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,003
-You hit a deer?
-Yeah, over on...

325
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,424
-I was on Slauson.
-A South Central deer?

326
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,552
Yeah, they out there.

327
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,680
It ran right in front of the car
and I couldn't avoid it.

328
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,141
Why you still carrying a passenger?

329
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,143
I was on my way to the depot and he's--

330
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,395
I could just drop him.
His drop is on my way.

331
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,106
Yeah, but your cab's unsafe to drive
and we have to impound it.

332
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,151
So we gotta do a vehicle inventory
before the tow truck gets here.

333
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,153
So pop the trunk and step out the vehicle.

334
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,031
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to call another cab.

335
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,742
Is that really necessary, Officer?
I'm just a half a mile from here.

336
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,369
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it is.
Please, step out the vehicle.

337
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:08,205
-You, too. Come on.
-If you open that trunk, they go inside.

338
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,207
You know what, man?
It's been a long night.

339
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,836
Plus, the barn is right up there.

340
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,339
Just give me a break. It's my first fare.

341
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,549
Get out the cab. Open the trunk. Come on.

342
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,138
Step out. You, too, sir. Please.

343
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:29,810
<i>This is Rampart Division dispatch.
Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover.</i>

344
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,897
<i>All available Precinct 26 units respond.
Over.</i>

345
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,775
-Hey, partner, we gotta roll.
-Roger. En route.

346
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,194
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night, sir.

347
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,301
Stop here.

348
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,247
-Hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.
-Why?

349
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,915
Because I say so.

350
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,052
<i>-Max. Max.
-Shit.</i>

351
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,138
<i>You out there, you son of a bitch?</i>

352
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,641
Who is that?

353
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,852
That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

354
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,565
<i>Max, I know you're out there.
Answer the goddamn call.</i>

355
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,401
-What happens if you don't?
-He just keeps calling me.

356
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,153
<i>Max, answer.</i>

357
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,160
Don't blow it.

358
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,749
<i>-Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.
- Just got ofi' the phone with the cops.</i>

359
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,710
<i>Desk sergeant called to check
you brought the cab in.</i>

360
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,672
<i>-Yeah, so'?
-So aside from I hate talking to cops,</i>

361
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,133
<i>they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?</i>

362
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,636
No. No, I got crashed into. I didn't...

363
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,431
<i>Do I care what, where or why?
You're paying.</i>

364
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,398
It was an accident. You're not liable.

365
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,651
It was an accident. I'm not liable.

366
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,613
<i>Bullshit. I'm making you liable.
It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.</i>

367
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,448
You tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

368
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,700
-I can't do that. That's my boss.
-So?

369
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,203
-I need my job.
-No, you don't.

370
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,165
<i>You still there? I'm talking to you.
Max! Max!</i>

371
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,627
-He's not paying you a damn thing.
-Who <i>the hell</i> is <i>this?</i>

372
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,342
Albert Riccardo, Assistant US Attorney,

373
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,136
a passenger in this cab,
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

374
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,305
-I efs not' get excited
-Not get excited?

375
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,890
How am I supposed to not get excited,

376
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,975
listening to you
try to extort a working man?

377
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,811
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

378
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,396
and general-liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

379
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,024
What are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

380
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,068
<i>-I was jusz' frying to-</i>
-Tell <i>it to him.</i>

381
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,529
Tell him he's an asshole. Go ahead.

382
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,156
You're an asshole.

383
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,825
Tell him he pulls this shit again,

384
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:33,494
you're gonna stick this yellow cab
up his fat ass.

385
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,833
And next time you pull any shit, I'm--

386
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,294
I'm gonna have to stick this yellow cab
up your fat ass.

387
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,645
Shit!

388
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,898
<i>Things like protective orders,
because you think of domestic stalking</i>

389
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,360
<i>where a husband wants his wife back
or boyfriend-girlfriend kind of thing.</i>

390
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,612
<i>We always hear,
"Get your protective order."</i>

391
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,573
<i>Well, a protective order's
a too! that we use,</i>

392
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,492
<i>but often times it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker.</i>

393
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:15,744
Yeah.

394
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,621
<i>Mr. Clarke,
there's a notary here to see you.</i>

395
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,373
Well, did he identify himself as a notary?

396
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,292
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

397
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,711
All right, sure, send him up.

398
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,699
Hey! Hey, I'm in the cab!

399
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,826
Hey!

400
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,997
Shit. Down here in the-- in the alley!

401
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,333
Shit!

402
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,674
Hey, hold up.

403
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,100
Oh, man, yeah. Hey, yeah, right there.

404
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:23,687
I'm in the cab, man. I'm stuck.
Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,566
Hey, man. Look, I gotta get out of here.

406
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,654
-What's up, man? What's going on?
-Look, this guy tied me up.

407
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,198
He's up in this building,
wreaking havoc, doing some wild shit.

408
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,408
-I need to get out of here.
-You all tied up in there, huh?

409
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,744
Yeah, I'm trapped. Get me outta here
so we can call the cops.

410
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,704
Why don't you give me your fucking wallet?

411
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:44,041
-Are you kidding me?
-Do I look like I'm kidding you?

412
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,628
Listen, don't you see that my hands
are tied to the steering wheel?

413
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:52,299
I don't give a damn what they're tied to.
I'll fuck you up.

414
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:55,177
-Don't shoot, man.
-Then get your ass up.

415
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,512
-Fuck.

416
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,975
What the fuck else you got in here?
Jackpot

417
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,271
Thanks, for real.

418
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:14,697
Yo, homey.

419
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,618
That my briefcase?

420
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,788
This your briefcase? Yeah, it is.
Why, you want it back?

421
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,082
How about your wallet?

422
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,919
What else you got for me?

423
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,800
Fuck!

424
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,527
Where's the button? Under the dash?

425
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,952
Mind getting it?

426
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,593
You attract attention, you're gonna get
people killed who didn't need to be.

427
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,636
You understand?

428
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,305
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

429
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,525
But, hey, new news.
We're ahead of schedule.

430
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,863
-You like jazz?
-I'm sorry. What?

431
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,283
-Jazz. You like jazz?
-Not that much.

432
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,662
Guy told me about this place off Crenshaw.

433
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:48,332
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

434
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:53,045
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

435
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,299
Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.

436
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,854
This informant of yours,
what's his name? Ramone?

437
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:14,316
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

438
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,027
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

439
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,113
Yeah, how long you been working this guy?

440
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,657
Four months. He's a low-level player.

441
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,868
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

442
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,412
Felix Reyes-Torrena?

443
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,498
Feds are all over him.
They don't want us anywhere near it.

444
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,000
Since when's LAPD working for the Feeb?

445
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,503
If they're into it,
they're just gonna take all our stuff,

446
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,005
build their case, take all the credit.
So what is the point?

447
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,216
The point is, is my guy flew out a window.

448
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,926
So if my Cl flies out a window,

449
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,804
then he's got Felix's handprints
on his ass.

450
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,347
That makes it mine.

451
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:49,059
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

452
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,105
-I just see a bunch of broken glass.
-And blood.

453
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,483
Down here, in the glass. Here's some more.

454
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,695
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

455
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,906
<i>-Richard?</i>
-Yeah, <i>it's me.</i>

456
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:13,083
Ramone went through that window, splat.

457
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:17,212
Glass here. Then tires rolled over it.

458
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,215
-Maybe he jumped.
-Sure.

459
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,635
He's depressed, so he jumps four stories
out of a window onto his head.

460
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,762
"Wow, that feels better."
Picks himself up.

461
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,056
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

462
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,352
-Come on, man.
-Hey, Ray! Catch.

463
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,568
-Recent?
-You can still smell the cordite.

464
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,113
Old guy across the alley
watching late-night TV

465
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,407
says he saw a cab parked here
earlier tonight

466
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,951
with two guys walking around the hood.

467
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,620
Description? He see anything?

468
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:52,664
Kind of saw.
Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.

469
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,292
There are 4,000 taxicabs in LA County.

470
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,461
-You got anything else?
-That's it.

471
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,631
Okay. Keep knocking. Let's keep knocking.

472
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,842
Remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?

473
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,428
Cabbie drove around all night,
killed three people,

474
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:09,223
-then put the gun to his head.
-Yeah, the guy flipped out. So what?

475
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,808
So that Oakland PD detective,
what's-his-name, he never bought it.

476
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,895
Cabbie had no criminal record,
no history of mental illness.

477
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,564
Pops three people, then himself?

478
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,111
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

479
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,979
I never learned to listen to jazz.

480
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:02,192
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

481
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:06,196
-Improvising, like tonight.
-Like tonight?

482
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,764
Most people, ten years from now,

483
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:35,267
same job, same place, same routine,
everything the same.

484
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,061
Just keeping it safe
over and over and over.

485
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:39,980
Ten years from now.

486
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,775
Man, you don't know where you'll be
ten minutes from now.

487
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,528
Do you?

488
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,505
-Who is that on the trumpet?
-That's Daniel, baby. He's the owner.

489
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:11,386
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

490
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,681
-I gotta buy him a drink.
-Sure thing, darling.

491
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:26,151
<i>No, now, see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.</i>

492
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,071
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

493
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,990
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

494
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,659
I mean, take this one night.

495
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:36,953
July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

496
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,747
Bye, baby.

497
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,249
Miles Davis. That's right.

498
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,542
-In the flesh?
-That's right.

499
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:46,004
I'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

500
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,381
Jesus.

501
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:51,760
Anyway, he had been at a recording session
up at Columbia, up on Vine.

502
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:54,096
So Miles comes through that door.

503
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,308
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

504
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,561
-It had to be--
-It was scary.

505
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,314
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

506
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,692
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway, man.

507
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,193
Everybody and their mama knew

508
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,321
that you don't just come up
and talk to Miles Davis.

509
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:15,826
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

510
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:20,163
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

511
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:23,291
And the guy says, "Hi, my name is--"

512
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,836
Miles said, "Get the fuck out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

513
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,255
Take your silly bitch with you."

514
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,509
You know? That's-- That was Miles, man.

515
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:36,847
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

516
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,807
But did you get to talk to him?

517
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,058
-Better than that.
-No.

518
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,354
-I played for about 20 minutes.
-Unbelievable.

519
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,148
-How'd you do?
-How'd I do?

520
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,234
Well, you really ain't shit when
you're playing next to Miles Davis.

521
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,528
But he carried my ass.

522
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,906
-What'd he say?
-He said one word. "Cool."

523
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,908
-"Cool"?
-Yeah.

524
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,493
-That's it?
-Yeah.

525
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,871
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

526
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,498
It meant, "Look me up when you are."

527
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,209
-Did you?

528
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,088
I got drafted
and got into some other things,

529
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:14,634
and by the time I got back to music,
the season had passed.

530
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,555
But, you know, I was born in 1945,

531
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:22,517
but that night was
the moment of my conception.

532
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,729
-Right here in this room.
-Crowd's not here now.

533
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,982
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

534
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,444
What a great story.

535
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:37,532
I gotta tell the people in Culiacén
and Cartagena that story.

536
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:54,007
You know the folks in Culiacén
and Cartagena?

537
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,467
Afraid so.

538
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,554
Man, just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

539
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:03,266
I am a cool guy,
with a job I contracted to do.

540
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,644
Come on, Vincent, give the dude a pass.

541
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,939
-I'm working here.
-You the one talking about improvisation.

542
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:12,400
You like the guy, you like how he plays.
Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.

543
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,568
Improvi...

544
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,320
That's funny, coming from you.

545
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,246
How's this? I'll ask a question.

546
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:27,123
-What question?
-A jazz question.

547
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:30,460
Now, you get it right, we roll.

548
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:34,005
You disappear tonight.

549
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,341
If I walk out of here tonight,

550
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,428
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

551
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:41,888
And one more thing.

552
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:44,891
These people and their rep here, Felix,

553
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:48,228
well, you tell them I'm sorry.

554
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:52,983
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

555
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:56,152
I was compelled.
It was either play ball or go back inside.

556
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:59,364
And I'm not going back inside.

557
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,910
Yeah.

558
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,999
Lay it on me.

559
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,459
Where did Miles learn music?

560
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,628
I know everything
there is to know about Miles.

561
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,130
Then let's have it.

562
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,341
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

563
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,261
His father was a dentist, East St. Louis.

564
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,263
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

565
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,725
He sent Miles
to Juilliard School of Music,

566
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,060
New York, 1945.

567
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,437
Man.

568
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,745
Dropped out of Juilliard
after less than a year.

569
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,247
Tracked down Charlie Parker
on 52nd Street,

570
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,583
who mentored him for the next three years.

571
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,274
-Hey.
-No.

572
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,278
-No, I'm done. Find you another cab.
-Max.

573
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:23,031
Leave me alone. I'm collateral anyway.

574
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,581
I am not playing.

575
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,961
You played him, man.

576
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:41,383
If he got the answer right,
would you have let him go?

577
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,973
<i>This is 102. This is 102. Max?</i>

578
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,684
-What is it with this guy?
<i>-Max?</i>

579
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,613
-You hassling my driver again?
<i>-Who</i> are you?

580
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:06,241
The same guy you talked to last time.

581
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,744
<i>Max's mother's driving me crazy.
Put him on the line, please.</i>

582
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,204
Hang on.

583
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,665
Carefully.

584
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,670
-Yea <i>h.</i>
- <i>Your mother's calling e very 70 minutes.</i>

585
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,131
<i>"Why didn't he show?"
"Are you all right?" "Where are you?"</i>

586
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,799
Show for what?

587
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,011
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

588
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:28,471
<i>I'm not related to you.
You tell her yourself.</i>

589
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,265
Show up for what?

590
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,352
She's in the hospital.

591
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,938
-You visit every night?
-Yeah. What difference does it make?

592
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:39,357
-You don't show up, it breaks routine.
-So?

593
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:43,653
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

594
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,866
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

595
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:52,078
Since when was any of this negotiable?

596
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,129
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

597
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,511
Hey. Flowers?

598
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,931
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

599
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,895
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

600
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:23,526
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

601
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,613
Excuse me. Keep the change.

602
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,626
Hold that elevator, please.

603
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,589
-Floor?
-Five. Thanks.

604
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:59,896
-Having a good night?
- <i>Mezzo mezzo.</i> You?

605
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,615
Excuse me.

606
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:45,942
Hey, Ma.

607
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:51,614
-I've been calling and calling.
-Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.

608
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,867
Why couldn't you call me on the telephone?

609
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,786
I'm lying here wondering
if something terrible happened to you.

610
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,163
I brought you flowers.

611
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,623
-What am I gonna do with flowers?
-Cheer up.

612
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,000
How?

613
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:06,880
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just gonna wilt and die?

614
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,423
See what I mean?

615
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,925
I didn't buy you the flowers, Mom. He did.

616
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,260
Who?

617
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:20,018
Why didn't you tell me we had company?

618
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,481
What's your name? Sorry. My son is rude.

619
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,233
No harm done, ma'am.

620
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,195
You paid for my flowers?

621
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,322
They're beautiful.

622
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,040
Well, Max?

623
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:49,589
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

624
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:55,053
I'm very happy to meet you, Mrs. Durocher.

625
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,888
Oh, just call me Ida.

626
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:01,017
Ida. I was with Max when he got the call.

627
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,228
And you came all the way
over here to see me?

628
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:06,522
-It's nothing, ma'am.
-Tell my son.

629
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:10,610
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

630
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,155
You must be one of Max's
important clients.

631
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,867
Client? You know, I like
to think of myself as his friend.

632
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,620
Max never had many friends.

633
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,373
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

634
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:26,042
Mom, how many times I got to ask you?
Please don't do that.

635
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,210
Do what?

636
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,380
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

637
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,756
What's he saying?

638
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,426
He says he's standing right here,
in the room here.

639
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,095
Yes, you are.

640
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,597
-He's sensitive.
-I know.

641
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,685
-But I'm sure you're very proud of him.
-Of course I'm proud.

642
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,229
He started with nothing, you know.

643
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:49,357
-Look at him today. Here, Vegas...
-Mom. Mom.

644
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,652
Mom. Mom, he is not interested
in hearing about all that, okay?

645
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,154
I came to see you. I saw you.
You look good. Let's go.

646
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:58,658
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

647
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,619
-Limousine companies.
-Is that right?

648
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:04,038
He drives famous people around.

649
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:08,459
Famous people. Limousine companies.
Now, that's quite an achievement.

650
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,545
What did you say your name was again?

651
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,547
My name is Vincent, ma'am.

652
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:16,884
-Visit again?
-No, I'm just in town tonight.

653
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,845
-When you come back.
-Sure.

654
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,031
Max!

655
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:23,368
Don't!

656
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:56,901
All of my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

657
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:04,075
Let's see what else you can do.

658
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:11,999
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

659
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,340
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

660
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:26,514
No, next.

661
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,684
Okay, you know, something's funny
about this, though, you know.

662
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:34,105
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

663
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:38,651
The kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, I think.

664
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:42,321
-Why do you say that?
-Wound pattern.

665
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,242
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

666
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:49,954
This guy, he's shooting tight groups too.
All right? Check this out.

667
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,582
Double taps a couple millimeters apart.

668
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,042
Let's see this one.

669
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,262
See what I mean?

670
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,017
-Holy shit. Can I use your phone?
-Yeah.

671
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,442
Come on, come on, wake up.

672
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,417
-Hello.
-Hey, it's Fanning.

673
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:39,086
I'm still down here at the morgue
at Sisters of Charity.

674
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,338
Those John Does didn't pan out,

675
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,216
but you're never gonna guess
who I got here in the meat locker.

676
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,510
-Who?
-Sylvester Clarke.

677
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,595
Criminal attorney turned lawyer-criminal.

678
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:53,142
<i>Including Ramone, who he represented,
who's still missing.</i>

679
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:56,020
The both of whom are in
the exotic-substances business together.

680
00:55:56,479 --> 00:56:00,233
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

681
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:03,444
Tell you what. Stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

682
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:05,696
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

683
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,948
Good.

684
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:15,081
You're gonna go to a place
called El Rodeo.

685
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,166
It's on Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera.

686
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,002
-Where at on Washington?
-Look it up.

687
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,467
Limos, huh?

688
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,594
Don't start.

689
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,514
I'm not the one lying to my mother.

690
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,392
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

691
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,602
Yeah, right.
Maybe she hears what you tell her.

692
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,646
Whatever I tell her
is never good enough anyway.

693
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,189
It's always been that way.

694
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:44,860
-So what's at El Rodeo?
-Just drive.

695
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,282
They project onto you their flaws.

696
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:52,868
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

697
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,162
They rank on you instead.

698
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:59,584
-How do you know?
-I had a father like that.

699
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,211
Mothers are worse.

700
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:04,964
Wouldn't know.
My mother died before I remember.

701
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,632
What happened to your father?

702
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,844
Hated everything I did.

703
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,433
Got drunk, beat me up. Foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

704
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:19,770
Then what?

705
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,649
I killed him.

706
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,903
I was 12.

707
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,163
I'm kidding.

708
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,209
He died of liver disease.

709
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:47,298
-Well, I'm sorry.
-No, you're not.

710
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:06,692
What is this, driving a cab temporarily?
It's just all bullshit, huh?

711
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:09,070
It is not bullshit.

712
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,072
Twelve years isn't temporary, Max.

713
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:14,867
Gotta get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

714
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,744
Gotta staff up, get the right client list.

715
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,914
It's not just simply get the car
and put asses in the seats.

716
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,082
Why not?

717
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,710
Because Island Limos
is more than just a ride.

718
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:28,005
It's like a club experience. Cool groove.

719
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:32,843
Don't want it to end.
It's gotta be perfect.

720
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:33,928
Uh-huh.

721
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,304
Perfect.

722
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:39,016
It's up here. Turn right.

723
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:03,207
-Give me your wallet. Come on.
-Give you my wallet. For what?

724
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,211
I'll hold it for you in case
the people inside search you.

725
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,005
-Who's searching?
-The people inside.

726
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,800
Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.

727
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,009
-Felix.
-Yeah.

728
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,595
-What does he look like?
-I don't know. I've never met him.

729
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,222
Who is he?

730
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,808
He's connected to the guys who hired me.

731
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,144
-I don't get it.
-You destroyed my workups.

732
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,770
Number four's due.
What'd you think, night's over?

733
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:26,897
Called on account of rain?

734
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,358
You go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

735
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,652
-They'll be on flash drive or CD.
-Me?

736
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:33,529
-How come you don't go?
-I don't meet people.

737
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,197
Risk management. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

738
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:36,699
You're not gonna screw that up.

739
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,827
I got a contract with their bosses.
These guys don't get to meet me.

740
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,495
They don't know what I look like.

741
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:46,625
If I don't pull it off, then--

742
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:49,211
They will kill you.
Now, you got 10 minutes.

743
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:50,963
At 10:01, I drive to the hospital

744
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,840
and execute your mother
on my way out of town.

745
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,968
-And don't pretend indifference.
-I can't do this.

746
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,678
-I can't.
-What are you talking about?

747
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,764
Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey. Hey.

748
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:03,350
Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna
end up getting other people killed.

749
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,477
Out of options, Max.

750
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,063
Just take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.

751
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:11,567
-How long you been doing this?
-Why?

752
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,235
Just in case they ask me.

753
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:18,032
-Private sector, six years.
-Okay. All right, six years.

754
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:22,578
You get benefits?
Or, you know, like, insurance? Pension?

755
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:26,457
No. No paid sick leave. Quit stalling.
Get out of the cab.

756
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,612
-Yeah? Hold up.
-Hold on, man.

757
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
Who is this?

758
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,294
Mark the time.

759
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:19,552
All right, it's cool.

760
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,892
-What's up, homes?
-Hey. What's up?

761
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:30,855
I'm here to see Felix.
He has something for me.

762
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,815
Don't know no Felix.

763
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:38,571
Tell him...

764
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:44,076
Say it's Vincent.

765
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,453
I'm Vincent.

766
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,510
COPY-

767
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,764
Let him in. Let him in right now.
Go ahead.

768
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,757
Detective Richard Weidner, LAPD,
Major Narcotics Division.

769
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,718
-Detective Ray Fanning, LAPD--
-Yeah. Hi. Okay. How are you?

770
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,345
Agent Frank Pedrosa.

771
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:46,055
-Good. Thanks for seeing us.
-You're welcome.

772
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,974
How can I help? What's up?
Why do you wanna know about our case?

773
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:51,894
-Any unusual activity tonight?
-Like what?

774
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,229
That relates to a murder
or a series of murders

775
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:56,190
in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?

776
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,568
All quiet on the western front.

777
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:02,363
Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

778
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:06,033
They come and go in cars, pickups, taxis.

779
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,327
Other than that, we watch air move.

780
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,039
-Your interest in our case?
-Well, our interest--

781
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,999
We got a situation. Two bodies.

782
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,752
Could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.

783
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,880
It doesn't look like one.
We got an attorney and his client--

784
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,007
Roofs all beat to shit.

785
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,594
Roofs all beat to shit.

786
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,556
-Can you zoom in on this, please?
-On what?

787
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,975
On that.

788
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,357
-Look at that right there.
-What is it?

789
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:46,824
Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.

790
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,368
5Q49974.

791
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,217
I thought you'd be taller.

792
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,556
So, Vincent.

793
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,937
-What are the two names?
-Ramone Ayala and Clarke.

794
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:01,523
Are you telling me Ramone Ayala
and Clarke were murdered tonight?

795
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:03,734
-Both killed?
-Sylvester Clarke for sure.

796
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,861
-Ramone, I don't know.
-I got another DOA.

797
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,530
Daniel Baker out of South Central,
Leimert Park.

798
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:09,823
That's three.

799
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,283
-Three what?
-Witnesses.

800
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:15,871
Vincent meet their people

801
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,999
in Culiacén or Cartagena.

802
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:22,419
But he don't meet you. Okay.

803
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:25,964
Now you're here.

804
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:29,510
Why?

805
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,389
I lost my stuff.

806
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,476
The list.

807
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:43,023
I want you to listen to me real well.

808
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,486
Special groups put together
the list of dedos.

809
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:50,239
-Ded0s?
-Fingers. informants.

810
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:56,078
Signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software, surveillance.

811
01:05:56,954 --> 01:06:00,749
A very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.

812
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:04,128
An important list. Wouldn't you say?

813
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,589
And you lost it?

814
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,844
Yeah.

815
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,345
I'm sorry.

816
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:15,848
Sorry.

817
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:18,976
Ilsorry"?

818
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:22,104
"Sorry" does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

819
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:27,818
-Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
-No.

820
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,696
-Do you believe in Santa Claus?
-No.

821
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:32,614
Nor do I.

822
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:35,659
Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.

823
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:40,289
But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper.

824
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,918
Pedro e| Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.

825
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,713
There's an old Mexican tale...

826
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:52,759
that tells of how Santa Claus got so very
busy looking out for the good children

827
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:56,513
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

828
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:58,557
So he hired Pedro.

829
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,601
And Santa Claus gave him a list

830
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:04,146
with all the names
of all the bad children.

831
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,065
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

832
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:10,402
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

833
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,738
that were not saying their prayers,

834
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:17,451
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows.

835
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,286
A little burro.

836
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,246
And he would come back.

837
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,248
And if the children
were still misbehaving,

838
01:07:23,332 --> 01:07:26,627
Pedro would take them away
and nobody would ever see them again.

839
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:32,090
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

840
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:35,969
how do you think
jolly old Santa Claus would feel

841
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:39,514
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "| lost the list"?

842
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,684
How fucking furious
do you think he would get?

843
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,020
Tell me, Vincent.

844
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:47,981
Tell me what you think.

845
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:51,777
What?

846
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,114
I think...

847
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:03,413
I think you should
tell the guy behind me...

848
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,333
to put that gun down.

849
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,795
What did you say?

850
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:12,714
I said, I think you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

851
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:16,093
before I take it
and beat his bitch ass to death with it.

852
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:28,105
I picked up a tail.

853
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,316
-Federal?
-I don't know. You tell me.

854
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,153
That's why I tossed the list.

855
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:38,573
The workups, all of that shit.

856
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:41,910
To protect, in part, your...

857
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:46,164
Hermés, Fagonnable ass.

858
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,547
What, you think I like coming in here?

859
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:59,011
But, hey, shit happens.

860
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,972
Gotta roll with it. Adapt.

861
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,808
Darwin. I Ch/'ng.

862
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,894
Has--

863
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:10,731
The fat man. The penthouse guy.
The jazz man.

864
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,192
That leaves two.

865
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:24,995
Can you finish?

866
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,664
In six years...

867
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,711
when have I not?

868
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:34,379
<i>Say it's Vincent.</i>

869
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,590
<i>I'm Vincent.</i>

870
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,759
<i>Say it's Vincent.</i>

871
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,677
<i>I'm Vincent.</i>

872
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:43,138
<i>Say it's Vincent.</i>

873
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,599
<i>I'm Vincent.</i>

874
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,226
<i>-$a y it is Vincent.
-Vincent?</i>

875
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,229
-That's what I'm hearing.
-I'm Vincent.

876
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,004
Your last two.

877
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,470
And by the way,
as a token of my appreciation,

878
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,514
I would like to offer you a discount.

879
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,560
For all my services, 25%.

880
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,398
-Very generous.
-Hell, make it 35.

881
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,276
And, by the way...

882
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,864
Daniel said he was sorry.

883
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,329
Interesting.

884
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,662
E-mail me his license.

885
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,998
-Right.
-To my cell phone.

886
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:34,624
No, no, I'll wait.

887
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,377
Hey, is there anybody else in that cab?

888
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,022
Vegas odds would've been
against you walking out of there.

889
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,107
Yeah, very impressive.

890
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,197
6th Street by Alexandria.
A club called Fever. Know it?

891
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,711
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated, get him safe.

892
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,047
-LA 101 to chase units.
-Yeah.

893
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,965
African-American, medium build.

894
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:26,134
The assault team will do the takedown.

895
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,844
-Are you sure?
-Do not spook him before.

896
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:30,180
I want air support up
and to maintain at 1,500 feet.

897
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,389
Thank you.

898
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:39,022
-How long?
-Twelve minutes.

899
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:41,650
According to
the cab company's dispatch unit,

900
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:43,860
this guy's been driving that cab
for 12 years.

901
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:44,945
So what?

902
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,657
So you're telling me the guy
walks into a phone booth and, shazam,

903
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,909
changes into a meat-eater super-assassin?

904
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,245
What's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?

905
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:55,747
No, the real cabdriver
is floating down a storm drain.

906
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,916
The guy who walked out of there
looks like this guy.

907
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,876
'Cause he picked a cabdriver
who looks like him.

908
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,588
-Yeah, I don't know.
-I do. Zee?

909
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:06,841
We see private-sector security companies
hiring out to cartels

910
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,969
in Colombia, Russia, Mexico,

911
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:13,932
hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi,
ex-KGB, like that, all the time.

912
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,894
Guys with trigger time, skill sets, real
tradecraft, like, look like a cabdriver.

913
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:19,854
What are you gonna do?

914
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,440
Take his ass down. Save our witness.

915
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:29,906
What if these guys are wrong?

916
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,492
They got the guy admitting
his name is Vincent.

917
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:35,495
-He's in there talking to the bad guys.
-There is something else going on.

918
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,082
Ray, there's nothing else going on.
I thought there was. There isn't.

919
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,835
It's their ball. It's their game.
There's nothing in it for us.

920
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,837
-There's nothing in it for you.
-That's right.

921
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,923
It's late. I'm going home.
You know what time it is?

922
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,101
They locate Peter Lim yet?

923
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,735
Sheila's on with the wife.
She thinks he's at Fever.

924
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,487
6th and Alexandria. Move it.

925
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,532
LA 101 to LA 103, LA 105, LA 108.

926
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:57,243
Witness is in a club called Fever,
6th and Alexandria.

927
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:58,662
That's where Vincent is going.

928
01:14:58,745 --> 01:15:01,206
<i>Assault team and remaining units,
you will take Vincent.</i>

929
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:04,542
<i>First unit on the scene will get
the witness, Peter Lim. Get him out.</i>

930
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:07,921
LA 105 to LA 101. Copy that.

931
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,250
-You gonna call her?
-Who?

932
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,294
Your lady friend,
the one who gave you her business card.

933
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:50,630
I don't know.

934
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:53,299
-Maybe, maybe not.
-What?

935
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:55,927
Pick up the phone.

936
01:15:57,137 --> 01:15:59,889
Life's short. One day, it's gone.

937
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:07,731
You and I make it out of this alive,
you should call her.

938
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,025
That's what I think.

939
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,529
Anyway...

940
01:17:57,632 --> 01:17:59,467
There he is. Hit it.

941
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:32,542
Let's do it.

942
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,095
Table towards the back is where he hangs.

943
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,277
Wilke, take the right.
Brian, hold the door.

944
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,947
Clean shots. Watch your backs.
Watch your backs.

945
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:04,324
LAPD.

946
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,631
Go 15 feet ahead, three feet to the left.

947
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,342
Wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. Clear?

948
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:49,113
There's Lim. Second booth from the left.
Get him out of here.

949
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,960
Middle of the dance floor.
Freeze, Vincent!

950
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:07,131
FBI! FBI! Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!

951
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:10,426
-Freeze! Get your hands up!
-FBI. Where's Peter Lim?

952
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,428
FBI! Get your hands in the air!

953
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:14,972
Drop it!

954
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:18,392
-Freeze!
-Freeze! FBI!

955
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:20,311
-I'm not Vincent.
-FBI!

956
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,481
Put the gun down! You got the wrong--

957
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,598
Pedrosa's been shot. Get an RA unit.

958
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:17,118
No! Wait, wait!

959
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,819
Hold on. Hold on. I'm Detective Fanning.

960
01:23:51,903 --> 01:23:53,029
I'm Max! I'm Max!

961
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,323
I'm a goddamn cabdriver, man!

962
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:58,117
I know. I'm getting you out of here.
I'm LAPD. Come on.

963
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,532
-How'd you find me?
-You're okay.

964
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:40,576
Just move it. Keep moving.

965
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:51,128
You're okay.

966
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:54,298
-How'd you find me?
-You're okay. You're okay.

967
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,176
You're okay. You're all right.

968
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:08,020
Let's go!

969
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:11,899
Let's go.

970
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,993
Go! Drive! Drive!

971
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,159
Only thing that didn't show up
is the Polish cavalry.

972
01:26:04,452 --> 01:26:06,370
You're alive.

973
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:07,705
I saved you.

974
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:14,337
Do I get any thanks? No.
All you can do is clam up.

975
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,967
You wanna talk? Want me to fuck off?

976
01:26:20,051 --> 01:26:21,052
Fuck off.

977
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:27,141
-You had to kill Fanning?
-Who the fuck is Fanning?

978
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,018
Fanning. The cop.

979
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,688
Why'd you have to kill him?

980
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,982
He's probably got family.
Kids gonna grow up without him.

981
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,651
He believed me.

982
01:26:38,778 --> 01:26:40,905
I should've saved him
because he believed you.

983
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,114
-Not that.
-Yeah. That.

984
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:43,949
Well, yeah, that. What's wrong with that?

985
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:46,285
-It's what I do for a living.
-Some living.

986
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:48,579
-Head downtown.
-What's downtown?

987
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:52,583
How are you at math?
I was hired for five hits. I did four.

988
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,171
Why not just kill me
and get another cabdriver?

989
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,966
Because you're good.
We're in this together.

990
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,803
Fates intertwined.
Cosmic coincidence. You know.

991
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:06,055
-You full of shit.
-A|| that crap. I'm full of shit?

992
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,140
You're a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself.

993
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:10,434
"A|| I am is taking out the garbage,
killing bad people."

994
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:13,104
-Well, that's what you said.
-You believed me?

995
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,942
-Then what'd they do?
-How do I know? You know?

996
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:19,443
They all got that...

997
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:23,322
"witness for the prosecution" look to me.

998
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:25,491
Probably some major
federal indictment of somebody

999
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:27,660
who majorly does not wanna get indicted.

1000
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:29,995
So that's the reason?

1001
01:27:31,414 --> 01:27:33,040
That's the why. There's no reason.

1002
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:35,918
There's no good reason,
there's no bad reason to live or to die.

1003
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:38,587
Then what are you?

1004
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:40,464
Indifferent.

1005
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:44,885
Get With it.

1006
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:47,221
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

1007
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,890
and a speck on one in a blink.

1008
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:52,601
That's us. Lost in space.

1009
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:56,522
The cop, you, me-- who notices?

1010
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,408
What's with you?

1011
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:09,952
As in?

1012
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:13,456
As in, if somebody had a gun
to your head and said,

1013
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:16,125
"You gotta tell me what's going on
with this person over here

1014
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,626
or I'm gonna kill you.

1015
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:23,090
What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

1016
01:28:23,174 --> 01:28:25,009
You couldn't do it, could you? Because...

1017
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:27,511
They would have to kill your ass,

1018
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:31,515
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

1019
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:35,478
I think you're low, my brother. Way low.

1020
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,317
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized-raised guys?

1021
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,319
Anybody home?

1022
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,779
And-- And the standard parts

1023
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:50,075
that are supposed to be there
in people, in you, aren't.

1024
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,374
And why haven't you killed me yet?

1025
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:05,424
Of all the cabbies in LA, I get Max--
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

1026
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,260
Answer the question.

1027
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:11,347
Look in the mirror.

1028
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,101
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

1029
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:19,396
-How much you got saved?
-That ain't none of your business.

1030
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,650
Someday? "Someday my dream will come"?

1031
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:26,111
One night you'll wake up,
and you'll discover it never happened.

1032
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,113
It's all turned around on you.

1033
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:30,658
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

1034
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,452
Didn't happen.

1035
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:36,580
And it never will, because you
were never gonna do it anyway.

1036
01:29:36,664 --> 01:29:39,792
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your Barcalounger,

1037
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:44,296
being hypnotized by daytime TV
for the rest of your life.

1038
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,257
Don't you talk to me about murder.

1039
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:50,511
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

1040
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:53,264
Or that girl.
You can't even call that girl.

1041
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:57,518
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

1042
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:19,039
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

1043
01:30:19,123 --> 01:30:21,709
Myself. I should have.

1044
01:30:23,836 --> 01:30:25,546
I've tried to gamble my way
out from under,

1045
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:28,674
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.

1046
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,884
-Slow down.
-It's gotta be perfect.

1047
01:30:30,968 --> 01:30:34,597
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

1048
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:39,476
I could've done it anytime I wanted to.

1049
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,686
Red light.

1050
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:49,778
But you know what? New news.

1051
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:53,449
It doesn't matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

1052
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:57,244
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

1053
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:58,662
<i>Twilight Zone Sh“.</i>

1054
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,837
Says the badass sociopath in my back seat.

1055
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:15,179
But you know what? That's the one thing
I gotta thank you for, bro.

1056
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:17,890
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

1057
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:24,146
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

1058
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:26,607
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

1059
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:30,235
-Slow down.
-Why? You gonna shoot me?

1060
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,820
You gonna pull the trigger and kill us?

1061
01:31:31,904 --> 01:31:33,739
-Go ahead, shoot my ass.
-Slow the hell down.

1062
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,784
You gonna shoot me? You gonna
shoot me now? You gonna kill us?

1063
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:39,453
Well, shoot my ass, then. Shoot me.

1064
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,288
-Slow down!
-You're right.

1065
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,458
You know what, Vincent?

1066
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,086
Go fuck yourself.

1067
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:23,038
-Well, that was brilliant.
-Didn't have your seat belt on?

1068
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,621
1-L-20, show me code 6
at Olympic and Figueroa

1069
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:06,039
on the TC with injuries.

1070
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:10,210
-Cop <i>y</i> your location.
-Sir, are you okay? What happened?

1071
01:33:11,587 --> 01:33:13,881
Sir, you were involved in an accident.

1072
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:16,300
An ambulance is on its way to help you.

1073
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:19,511
You understand what I'm saying to you?
Sit down and relax, okay?

1074
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:25,976
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

1075
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:29,605
Relax and breathe.

1076
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:45,412
Put your hands up.

1077
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:48,791
Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees.

1078
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,293
-Go ahead and arrest me.
-Put your hands on top of your head.

1079
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:53,921
-Take me to jail. LA County jail's great.
-Don't move!

1080
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:56,757
Put your hands behind your head.

1081
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,473
1-L-20, I need a backup on a 187 suspect.

1082
01:34:17,236 --> 01:34:19,863
-Put your gun down!
-Get back! Put your hands down!

1083
01:34:19,947 --> 01:34:21,532
-Look, I gotta go.
-Put down the gun!

1084
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:24,076
Stop moving! Stop moving!

1085
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,286
When did this become a negotiation?

1086
01:34:28,705 --> 01:34:30,916
Clap your hands together.
Hold your hands together.

1087
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:34,503
Listen, somebody's gonna get killed
if I don't go right now.

1088
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:35,838
Cuff yourself.

1089
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:39,091
I'm going to 6th and Fig. Call the cops.

1090
01:34:56,859 --> 01:34:58,277
Give me that.

1091
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,736
Hey, hey-- Fuck!

1092
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:29,600
Come on!

1093
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,673
Come on. Go through.

1094
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:06,011
Come on. Come on. Pick up.

1095
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:25,739
Pick up.

1096
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:28,450
Come on, girl.

1097
01:36:30,369 --> 01:36:31,453
Come on, pick up.

1098
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,728
US Attorney's Office.

1099
01:36:56,812 --> 01:36:58,146
-Annie!
- Yes.

1100
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:02,109
It's Max. Max, the cabdriver.
Listen to me, all right?

1101
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,902
<i>-A guy named Vincent--</i>
-Max.

1102
01:37:03,986 --> 01:37:05,654
<i>Listen to me, Annie.</i>

1103
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:09,866
-It's a strange time to be calling.
- Listen- Listen, Annie.

1104
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:13,328
There's a man named Vincent.
He's coming to kill you.

1105
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:17,666
-He's what?
-Kill you! He's coming to kill you!

1106
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:20,293
<i>He was scoping out the building
when I dropped you off--</i>

1107
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:24,798
Okay, Max, if this is supposed to be
some type of joke, it's not funny.

1108
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,050
It's not a joke.
Annie, listen to me, please.

1109
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:31,304
Felix hired him. Okay?
Or people that Felix worked for.

1110
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:34,016
Felix Reyes-Torrena.
How do you know about my case?

1111
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:35,809
I don't understand what's going on.

1112
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:39,271
All I know is that he's already killed
witnesses. He's coming to kill you.

1113
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:43,442
When I dropped you off, I don't know how,
but he ended up in my cab.

1114
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:05,380
<i>Annie.</i>

1115
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:08,300
<i>Listen. AI! I want you to do...</i>

1116
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:18,977
<i>-I don't understand whalis going on.
-Annie, listen.</i>

1117
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:20,145
<i>-Max.</i>
-Please listen.

1118
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:44,961
Get out of the building. Annie.

1119
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:51,802
- <i>Okay, I'm leaving the building night' now.
-No, wait.</i>

1120
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:54,679
<i>-Max.
- Wail', wail'.</i>

1121
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:59,434
<i>—Max.
- Where are you light' now? What' floor?</i>

1122
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:02,145
I'm on the 16th floor
in the law library and files.

1123
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:06,817
-He's two floors below you, corner office.
-In my office?

1124
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,903
<i>Listen, he does not know you're up there.
Just stay right there and call 911.</i>

1125
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:11,738
Are you sure he's on the 14th floor?

1126
01:39:11,822 --> 01:39:14,533
Listen, just stay there
and just call the police.

1127
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:17,786
<i>-Max?
- Annie...</i>

1128
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:21,581
Shit.

1129
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:30,298
Max?

1130
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:38,056
Shit.

1131
01:39:43,979 --> 01:39:46,231
-Max.
-He knows you're up there. Just...

1132
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:48,692
I can't hear you. Hello?

1133
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:50,986
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

1134
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:52,988
Shit.

1135
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:57,659
Annie. Annie!

1136
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:00,954
Shit.

1137
01:40:57,636 --> 01:40:58,845
<i>911. Operator.</i>

1138
01:40:58,929 --> 01:41:01,556
Yes. Listen, there is a man
in my building, and he is--

1139
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:08,021
Hello?

1140
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:18,586
Let her go.

1141
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,754
Max?

1142
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:24,759
Why? What are you gonna do about it?

1143
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,390
Come on.

1144
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:44,571
Max!

1145
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,801
Oh, God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?

1146
01:45:06,885 --> 01:45:08,553
Yeah. I met him.

1147
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:10,555
What do you mean, you met him? How?

1148
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:14,184
I don't know. Look, when
I dropped you off, there was a fare.

1149
01:45:14,267 --> 01:45:16,227
-He said his name is Vincent.
-Vincent?

1150
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:26,070
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-This is the street.

1151
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:29,240
This way. Come on.

1152
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:57,852
This way. Come on.

1153
01:45:58,353 --> 01:46:00,021
Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

1154
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:02,565
-What we gonna do?
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1155
01:46:03,316 --> 01:46:05,026
No, no. This way.

1156
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:29,384
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

1157
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:54,742
Stay down.

1158
01:47:43,249 --> 01:47:44,417
Shit.

1159
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:54,135
There's a station.

1160
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,260
Shit.

1161
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:12,171
Max!

1162
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:16,092
I do this for a living!

1163
01:50:27,747 --> 01:50:29,248
We're almost...

1164
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:32,251
at the next stop.

1165
01:50:34,253 --> 01:50:35,588
Hey, Max.

1166
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:42,720
A guy gets on the MTA here in LA and dies.

1167
01:50:48,434 --> 01:50:50,603
Think anybody will notice?

1168
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:50,872
Come on.
